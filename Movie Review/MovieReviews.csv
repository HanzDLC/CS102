",davish_wulf-1,24-Apr-22,"It isn't a porno movie, it isn't an erotic movie, it isn't an horror or suspenceful movie.It isn't anything, but a total waste of time.Takes too long for anything to finally happen and when it does, it is totally predictable.What a terrible waste of time watching sex clichés, exagerated old age stereotypes and a complete lack of suspence, horror or anything worthwile.Why even bother wasting money or time filming this?","

X," A fun throwback to 70's slashers
",adotson-98233,19-Mar-22,"""X"" is a very bloody, and satisfying horror film from A24 that is able to pack enough scary moments, while also talking it's time to develop its characters.The good in this movie right off the bat is the performances. Everyone in the movie is great. The standouts here are Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega. These two were great. The movie also has a really strong message about sex and what it really means for these people. It's a very strong message and it works. The gore here is also great. It's a very bloody movie and the final 40 minutes are amazing. It's also a very good looking movie. It's very well shot and there's a lot of creepiness to it. And finally I actually felt that the villains in this movie were actually very well portrayed. They were given a somewhat tragic issue, and it really added a lot to them.Now I do have a few negatives. The first being that I do wish there was a little more crazy moments. I wish the movie had just a little more bloody moments. I also felt that the first act, while good, was a little too slow paced. I wish it do move a lot faster. And finally there are some things aren't fully explained towards the end.Overall ""X"" is a very bloody good time with great acting, great direction, and some truly bloody moments.","

X," Gross and weird, not in a good way
",FeastMode,18-Mar-22,"This is a technically well-made movie. It's a slow burn but I was never bored. I was enjoying it and curious to see what comes next. Until it got weird. And gross. This is coming from someone who watches tons of horror and gore. That wasn't the problem. The gore is one of the movie's best qualities.But the direction they take with some of the ""horror"" late in the movie is off-putting. I understand what they are going for. I understand that's the point. And the point does come across. It still doesn't change how I felt. Which was unsettled, not scared.Some people might like that type of ""horror"" (like Gabe from The Office lol). I am not one of those people. It's unfortunate because it's a good setup that just doesn't land for me. (1 viewing, opening night 3/17/2022)","

It's also really dark, so it's hard to tell what's going on a lot of the time.The killings are boring and unoriginal.The cast are dull and lacklustre.The cinematography is basic and the sound is terrible - especially the weird sound they play for the jump scares.Hated this and now I hate all the people involved.Absolute wasters!","

It was barely interesting and towards the end became repugnant and repelling. The old man effects just looked dumb. The fact that this has so many 7-10 ratings and all the fake reviews is just sad.

X," X hits the spot
",kosmasp,09-Apr-22,"Ti West is back - I have to admit since we had a pandemic I didn't really think or realize he was gone. Something I only heard from others that this is his ""comeback"" piece. Again not how I view it, but nevermind that, enjoy this horror movie that also has a sexual tone to it ... and quite a lot of innuendo.The sex is not just there to titilate of course (although I was more than surprised to see Brittany Snow show what she is blessed with), no it serves the story and especially one of the many themes we have here. There is a discussion about being young, living life to the fullest or at least to an extent that makes one happy. Before you get old and have too many regrets. Young vs old is something you could say. But the less you know going in, the better you will be able to receive.The acting is good and not just from the clearly younger people in old age makeup (look at in the credits who is playing the woman if you have not realized it while you were watching). Effects are top notch, though not for the faint hearted ... you cannot be too squeamish.Go in this ride, that while a serious slasher, is not with a touch (or more) of dark humor. And if you read some innuendo in what I just wrote ... well you may not be entirely wrong about coming ... to that conclusion.","

X," Horrors are meant to be scary
",AfricanBro,17-Sep-22,"I was about to go see Pearl then read that it's based on X in the synopsis so I thought I should view this first. And the fact that a second movie was released so soon after it's first gave me hope. It's not as good as I expected but I don't think it could have been that much better. My concept of horror is a movie that's supposed to scare you and this really doesn't; it's becoming more common for movies to throw in a couple gory scenes and death then labeling it horror. Can't call it a thriller either 'cause it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. The premise is pretty original I'll give it that but it's just not scary. Should be executed better. It's slow paced so it feels like it's building up to something and when it comes it's all over pretty quickly and I never really felt any tension in the life or death scenes. I didn't care for any of the characters either. More effort was put into the adult movie being made than put into actually frightening you.The directors artistic abilities are there, trying to have the same feel as old slasher movies from the 70's. It's pretty forgettable and horror movies shouldn't be, they should make you wanna sleep with the light on. If anything the only reason I'll have trouble sleeping at night is getting the image of two grotesquely old people have sex. When the credits rolled I was trying to recall what made me think this was going to be good.","

X," Filmmaker Ti West's valentine to '70s horror works its grind house magic.
",george.schmidt,08-Apr-22,"X (2022) ***1/2 Mia Goth, Jenny Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell, Stephen Ure. Filmmaker Ti West's valentine to '70s horror works its grind house magic with a foreboding tale about a group of friends circa 1979 who embark on a road trip to film a porno and get more than they bargained for while setting up shop on a creepy elderly couple's Texas farm in the middle of nowhere. The genre tropes are all there - the tension, eerie camera shots (thanks to cinematographer Eliot Rockett), grungy atmosphere (production designer Tom Hammock has a field day), a spooky sound design (by Graham Reznick) and genuinely unsettling make-up (designed with craft and skill by a team led by Michael Kenna). A fine ensemble with a surprising double role for Goth (as the lead actress with stardom in her eyes and the more than she seems old lady) keeps you glued to the screen with each moment of dread.","

I can only guess it's there because Brittany Snow, from Pitch Perfect is in it and she wanted a chance to sing.Then, 2 old people, who can barely seem to move, end up slaughtering everyone, for basically no reason.

X," A deranged, bloody love letter to Tobe Hooper
",drownsoda90,20-Mar-22,"""X"" follows a group of young actors and filmmakers in 1979 who rent out a guest home on an elderly couple's Texas farm to covertly shoot a smut film. However, things go awry when their hosts prove to be demented and dangerous.This feature from writer-director Ti West (who wrote and directed two solid indie horror films in the 2010s--""The House of the Devil"" and ""The Innkeepers"") is undoubtedly his most accomplished work to date. While it has all the standard machinations of your typical slasher film, the premise is unique, and the stylistic choices here are effective and inspired by the past in a way that does not feel gimmicky or cheap.While the first half burns slowly, it is peppered with a number of subtle creepy moments that foreshadow the pandemonium that is to come. The cast does a fantastic job, with Mia Goth making for a very memorable lead; the supporting performances by Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, Scott Mescudi, and Jenna Ortega are all equally smart and nicely telegraphed. Adding to the ambiance is an eerie western-meets-choral score by folk/goth rock songstress Chelsea Wolfe to really round things out.Above all, the film is a true love letter to the works of Tobe Hooper. That it draws on Hooper's seminal ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" almost goes without saying, but it also pays homage to his lesser-known followup feature ""Eaten Alive"" in more ways than one. Themes of personal autonomy, youth, longing, and regret are neatly folded into the screenplay, serving as springboards for the central conflict that drives the carnage, while Hooper's visual influence bleeds through it all.Homage aside, what is perhaps most refreshing about ""X"" is that it uses its touchstones wisely, working the slasher formula with intelligence but not veering into self-reflexive territory. In an era where hyper self-awareness has become a diegetic mainstay in horror films, ""X"" opts to check its pretensions at the door. What is surprising is that, in doing so, it still manages to operate as a smart, slick slasher flick. Even more than that, it is simply a rollicking good time. 9/10.","

X," X is unique for sure, but it didn't necessarily work for me.
",banzoozalreviews,10-Dec-23,"Finally got around to watching Ti West's highly acclaimed film 'X,' and I have mixed feelings about it. It definitely boasts a fantastic retro vibe and a creepy, dreamlike atmosphere that lingers with you. There's a palpable sense of unease and impending doom throughout, which I absolutely loved. Additionally, Mia Goth delivers a stupendous performance in both her roles as Pearl and Maxxine. Her character, Pearl, is undeniably creepy and scary. The movie also features some brilliantly unhinged kills.However, the film does suffer from a disjointed narrative and, at times, feels like a parody. It gives the impression of being a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive movie. Furthermore, there are moments where it seems to strive for excessive artistry, which can be overwhelming.","

X," A sex-crazed gore-fest that lacks its 'X' factor
",Rebul21,20-Mar-22,"After being involved in some great modern horror films such as Hereditary (2018) and Saint Maud (2019), A24's latest film is an immature mess that feels more like an exercise in superfluity than it is a meaningful narrative.Set in 1979, X follows six Americans as they arrive at an isolated farmhouse for a weekend, intent on shooting a porno. Hosted by an unsettling, elderly couple, things soon turn into a full-blown bloodbath.Obviously inspired by Tobe Hooper's classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), writer-director Ti West ensured that X was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. Where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. Mia Goth's Maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. Bobby-Lynne, played well by Brittany Snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. Jackson (Kid Cudi) is a Vietnam veteran, while Wayne (Martin Henderson) and RJ (Owen Campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. Finishing off the cast, Jenny Ortega plays the outsider of the group, Lorraine.Lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. However, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. They will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.From the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. The TV in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. As well as this, a well-crafted shot of Lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. Unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.This slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. The extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. It seems as if Ti West had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. And while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.The editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. Alongside this, X lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. The film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.Without a strong plot, X fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. The killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic. Decently written characters could not make up for some of the bizarre dialogue and while gore was in abundance suspense was not.","

The storyline is excellent and unfolds perfectly. This is a rare unique slasher film that horror fans have been clamoring for.

X," Twisted, disturbing, and surprisingly smart
",benjaminskylerhill,18-Mar-22,"Ti West is an incredibly astute visual director, and with X, he continues to show this. He turns this farmhouse into one of the most hellish nightmares imaginable, where there is no place that is truly safe.That being said, West has never impressed me with his writing before. His earlier films have very little detail put into the characters and themes-they're all concept and little substance. Thankfully that's changed with this one. This is probably West's most character-filled film.Every single character in this story is incredibly flawed, yet still retains a shred of sympathetic humanity. The protagonists live too much in the moment with no regard for future consequences, while the film's villains yearn for a bygone era of their lives and harbor envy toward those who have what they have lost. Each group represents an untenable human desire, and it adds a layer of melancholy to the terror that unfolds.It's not a perfect film; like pretty much all slasher films, there are some characters who exist just to get killed off in predictable fashion, and some death scenes come off as rather anticlimactic.Additionally, because every character kind of sucks as a person, there's a two-edged sword in that none of them are particularly likeable and I didn't get attached to them in the way I think West wanted me to.Still, this is quite a wild, effectively uncomfortable ride, and a far smarter one than I was expecting.","

It could've been better with a better set of villains. The old couple just lacked any sense of credibility. All they served to do was gross us out with their desire to get naked all the time!!! At least Leatherface was a credible and scary villain.Still it is definitely a movie to check out.","

X," Senior Citizens Rom-Com
",saint_brett,23-Apr-22,"OK, is this movie a cross between Boogie Nights and Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Let's find out.It must be noted that I'm watching this at 4pm with the sun still up. (Does one have to watch a movie at night to add to the effectiveness of the creepy nature?)
Movie starts off with a Sawyer homestead crime scene where sheriff Danny Glover combs the aftermath. He then steps right into a scene ripped right from ""Just Cause"" as the religious TV mumbles out some preacher rhetoric. ""Sheriff? You ought to take a look at this,"" informs the second in charge. Yeah, let the sheriff see it but don't show the audience. That's some Alfred Hitchcock leave-it-up-to-the-imagination stuff right there.This Wayne clown is doing his hardest to look and sound like Matthew McConaughy as is this movie's similarity to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Isn't this the same gas station as that recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre on Netflix?Won't surprise me if they pick up a hitchhiker next.Wow, this movie's biting so many scenes from Texas Chainsaw it's not funny. This Maxine character is even wearing Pam's red short shorts. It's also the same front door, same staircase. Is Leatherface hiding back there somewhere? You can pay homage to a movie but not steal directly from it.So, what are they gonna steal from next - the boat in the river scene from ""I Spit on Your Grave?"" Oh, it's ""Lake Placid,"" my mistake.This Maxine chick looks a lot like the blonde from Abba in the face. Especially around the eyes with the blue eye shadow.I'm still undecided if this old man looks like Robert Duvall, Uncle Leo, Willie Nelson or that hunchback thing from Rocky Horror.The possessive cameraman in the movie, who looks like Jarod Leto by the way, his curious girlfriend cheats on him and he cries like a baby before becoming the first victim in the movie. It's real cheap of this movie to steal Halloween's Blue Oyster Cult song. Another low blow.At certain times and angles this looks like the Evil Dead cabin as well.I wonder if that's Johnny Knoxville under those old people's body suits?I love in Hollywood movies how they exaggerate people flying through the air when it comes to shotguns, (Lethal Weapon.) A shotgun may dislocate your shoulder but it won't project you four feet backwards through the air. I saw a boar once take 3 shots from a boom stick and it stood its ground.For the record this modern movie did not capture the essence of the seventies, no sir. Not in the slightest. Modern day entertainment ain't leaving its mark on history. They're disposable throw away rubbish you only watch once and are then quickly forgotten.The recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre on Netflix was filmed in Bulgaria. This knockoff ""X Massacre"" clone was filmed in New Zealand. The state of Texas is being poorly misrepresented as of late.What's the matter Hollywood can't you film on real site locations anymore due to it being too expensive?A cast of porn actors, and film crew, travel out into the countryside of New Zealand where they pay fifty bucks for a cabin to film R-rated porn.The 2 geriatric hick homeowners of the land of fluffy clouds detest their inner city ways from the get-go and make this known causing a gulf of distrust. They resent them making love on their grounds and seek retribution because of jealousy and age bracket.By film's end you feel nothing, and hey, that's today's modern entertainment for ya.","

X," Disappointing morality tale.
",radhrh,15-Apr-22,"I had high hopes of the latest Ti West movie but it turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. Not scary in the slightest neither is it funny or sexy. West's trade mark gore has been toned down perhaps to get a wider audience but the movie fails to make up for that in other ways. I just couldn't care less about the characters, a bunch of sexual degenerates making a porno and the constant references to Christianity by way of a TV evangelist is just lazy writing. On the plus side I guess X could be viewed as a morality tale, bad stuff happens to those who do bad things but is that enough? No it isn't. Distinctly average ( at best ).","

No creative buildup with the alligators (once and done), the barns where one stood on a nail then well not much. Even the religious overtone wasn't used to amp up the feeling of impending doom.

The horror part is the final 45 minutes.Whilst there were a few good kill scenes it didn't save the movie. Paired with some lousy acting which was partly intentional giving the theme of the movie the only good performance coming from Mia Goth.With a muddled twist at the end I came out shaking my head. Not a terrible movie but not one that I'd recommend to my horror movie friends and no doubt I won't remember it in 6 months.I'm guessing the higher reviews are based on artist efforts rather than the story itself and the movie as a whole.

X," Not everything goes together
",brent-27849,25-Oct-22,"It's funny, I like porn. I like slasher movies. But when this movie put the two together, well, it's not like the person who first decided to put peanut butter and chocolate together, that person was a frickin' genius.For one thing, it's not exactly cutting edge. Pretty much every slasher movie in the 1980's have a certain element of soft core porn in them anyway. As for the 1970's look and shooting style. Again not overly impressed. To have actors who look like they could be from the seventies, the feather hair, the clothes, but the more I think about it, it feels like it's because of movies made in the 1970's that I think people looked and acted and talked that way than because they really are from the 1970's.The point is there wasn't one character I was particularly interested in. They all seemed to be cliches of cliches, the blond, the Linda Lovelace wannabe, the guy with the gasoline pump in his pocket. And most of that seemed to be cribbed from movies like Boogie Nights (not to mention When Harry met Sally), they're not just doing porn, they're doing art movies and of course they have their own little world in which they look out for each other, they're like a family with a little church mouse too.Again it's one of those movies where as soon as a character disappears for more than two minutes, I completely forget they were even in the movie. Oh yeah, I forgot about the one in the cellar, how's her hand again? What happened to the blond, she still alive, oh yeah, there she is sleeping.Which is the point, first they do the porn stuff and then they do the killing stuff, one by one, off the go. Which as another reviewer mentioned, I guessed absolutely every way they were going to be killed. Not even one was a surprise. The only thing I messed up on was the order in which they were killed. After the first guy got killed, I figured it would probably be the blond, boy, girl, boy, girl. But no, they killed all the guys first. Which really makes me wonder about this world, whatever happened to ladies first?As for the one who survived, yeah, pretty much figured if any of them were going to survive, it would be her. Only problem is I have no idea why she did survive. I mean, she is exactly the same as all the rest, not one thing different, so I can't for the life of me figure out why she lived. Not that I really cared except in a mildly disappointed way.But of course that leads to the reason behind the killing. I've seen some pretty bad reasons but I honestly can't think of one more stupid. It appears to be because granny ain't gettin' any. That's it. My first thought was well, maybe she should bake a few more pies then, find a hobby. Then I thought, well, it's kind of ironic, they're making a porno movie and it never occurs to the old lady to take matters into her own hands, sort to speak, maybe do it the way porn intended. I suppose in the 1970's they didn't have quite the same technical advances but they live on a farm, it can't be that hard to figure it out.Of course none was more interesting than wondering why she didn't ask if she could join in. I mean, the movie was called the Farmer's Daughters, and they already made room for the church mouse to join in, so they could have called it the Farmer's Daughters, plus one, and Granny. They were trying to make an art movie, well it don't get any more artistic than that. The great thing is it would have shown what cheap hypocrites they all were. Yes, they have one big scene where they talk about the hypocrisy of prudes and religious folk. Ok, well open minded people that they supposedly are, I would have loved to have seen old granny show up ready to get down to business, ready for her close ups. My guess is their open minds would have closed pretty darn fast, about as fast as they're knees.","

And around then it also becomes the very predictable horror movie.The main cast was actually really good. That gave me a lot of hope for the movie early on. The old couple was not good, especially the 'old' lady and their story line was also pretty bad.A key to good horror movies is wanting to yell at the main characters to not do something or to get out of there.

X," This was actually a nice surprise of a movie...
",paul_haakonsen,28-Apr-22,"As much as I enjoy horror movies and slasher flicks, then I had not heard about this 2022 movie titled ""X"" from writer and director Ti West. Needless to say that I had to sit down and watch it as I stumbled upon it. But I didn't know what I was in for here, so I had no expectations.First of all, I will say that Ti West definitely managed to put together a classic slasher horror movie, yet at the same time managing to put enough of a bizarre twist on it to make it stand out. So if you enjoy the horror genre, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""X"" if you get the opportunity.The storyline told in ""X"" was fairly straight forward, and it was very much akin to the horror movies of the 1980s. So that was definitely something that appealed to me. It was a good story, despite it being somewhat generic at times. But still, Ti West managed to thrown in enough curve balls to thrown off the audience every now and again.I wasn't familiar with the cast in the movie, but they certainly had put together a good cast ensemble. There was a good mix of talents in the movie, and it was fun to watch the people get taken out one by one as the story progressed.Visually then ""X"" was actually fairly good. Sure, this was not an over the top special effects movie, but there was enough blood and gore to keep a seasoned gorehound such as myself happy. The effects looked realistic and that served the movie quite well.The only things that bothered me about ""X"" was the obsession on showing prolonged sex scenes and such. It wasn't really necessary to further the storyline of the movie, and it just felt like it sleazed up the movie unnecessarily.I was genuinely entertained by ""X"" and it turned out to be a rather nice surprise of a movie. This is certainly a horror movie that I will recommend for fans of the 1980s slasher flicks.My rating of ""X"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","

X," Every one of these reviews was paid off, I'm sure of it
",memeishere,02-Apr-22,"I have many issues with this film, and I will be addressing them all in bulletin points.The plotThe groundwork that was laid for this film was cool, but it did nothing for anything. This movie revolves around a. Murder scenes b. Sex scenes..... that's it. If there's a story, it has not been told.The character developmentIt is so hard to care about any of these characters with the ways that they are portrayed. I would appreciate it more if it were obvious that the cast were supposed to be grey area characters. But they lack any substance of anything. We are told that the main women want to be stars. But why? Where's the motivation? I want to know why they are there and how they got there. Context can make a world of difference, and there is none. And even at the end, nothing is resolved. Is the character that Mia Goth plays still going to be a drug addict? Sure, she survived, but is she going to live beyond that?The messageThere isn't one. That's all I had to say, let's move on.The climaxOr lack thereof, I should say. Once this movie begins its murder rampage, it doesn't pause but it makes less and less sense. It gets so wrapped up in the ways that the characters have sex and get killed that it leaves no room for any suspense, any details, or character building. I still have no clue what the true climax was and when it was supposed to have started. I guess it is when Mia Goth (who I can't remember her character's name or any of the others' because they spent so little time on it) is in the main house and the rest of the cast members die. But it is so short-lived and creates no satisfaction.ClichésSo many of them. I could guess the way the characters died before it even happened.Where's the twist?I sat this whole movie through, expecting a twist. There's always one in the horror movies these days. I picked through all the details of the film, looked at every picture in their frames, and started guessing and trying to work out how it would end. And then a twist never came. They're just some old, whack-job couple I guess? Weird. Not much motivation for their ways either, other than the old lady's jealousy.-The resolution
Umm... I'm sorry, but the old man randomly having a heart attack in the hallway and dying is the LAZIEST way I have ever seen someone die in a horror/thriller. The script writers were so obsessed with the deaths and gore, but for this guy? Nahhh, that was suddenly too much. Dies silently and peacefully in the hallway of a heart attack. And wow, the old lady dying is almost as lazy. She gets blown back by firing a rifle, which cripples (?) her and she gets her head ran over by Miss Goth.-The whole stupid car keys part
The old lady steals the car keys... only for her to easily tell Mia where there are in the home (not even hidden or ON HER where they would've been the safest from being re-claimed by the group) after she realizes her husband has died. Could've just left that whole plot device out and everything would've been the same in the story. I'm going to also add that it is very flimsy storytelling that this evil old couple a. Died so easily without a fight and b. That the lady told Mia where the keys were JUST because he died. Is she suddenly no longer afraid of going to prison? Or that this girl she wants so badly will escape?TL;DR - This movie focuses so heavily on gore and sex that it loses all capability of telling a story or creating realistic characters.","

There's also a nod to Psycho where the movie takes a hard left halfway through. For me this is where the film goes wrong. The first hour is about the main characters making a skin flick and has more in common with Boogie Nights then anything else. The last 40+ minutes is by the numbers murder in the dark with the characters being killed off in order of importance.The problem for me is none of the component parts of the film go together. The slasher aspect doesn't mesh with the porn film aspect. There isn't a clear theme to the film. The characters aren't particularly likeable so I don't care. Maxine's storyline is poorly defined. The kills lack tension and suspense. There's lots of homage paid to so many films but at the expense of telling it's own story. At the end of the day, there's a lot going on here but none it goes together to tell a tense or entertaining film.","

X," 600 words is too high a requirement for simplistic movies
",justahunch-70549,26-Nov-22,"So it's a horror movie about a bunch of people setting out to make a pornographic movie in some remote location in Texas. I'm not sure I can come up with 600 words for a film that is lackluster when it comes to porn and is just a nonsensical slasher film, but to be honest, I don't think after all the horror and/or slasher movies I've seen since the 70's on that any can really be effective anymore. Yes, it's bloody, but been there, seen that. Mia Goth does deserve some mention as she's by far the best thing in the cast in two roles, but the rest are all forgettable. I do not understand the critical reception this received. .","

X," What an interesting concept, but fails in a lot of areas
",nicolasroop,18-Mar-22,"Ok, just got out of the theater and here's my thoughts.The good: The acting is very good, all the actresses seemed pretty game for what they had to endure, and the men were suitably fragile with their masculinity to make them easy targets for the creepy elderly couple. The film was definitely smutty enough with lots of nudity and sexuality, of which some was a turn on and some was incredibly disgusting and made me feel sick. There was some terrific comedic moments sprinkled in here and there. The gore and kills were plentiful enough and don't hold back. Although, they are more in the last third of the film, which I'll come back to. The motive for the kills was very creepy and extremely repulsive. The 70's aesthetic was spot on. And we finally have a final girl I felt I could root for, which it's been a while for that.The bad: The film took it's time getting to the fun stuff. Very slow and unsurprising, in a very cliche way, like we've seen this set-up before in several other horror movies. It honestly didn't start sparking my attention until about the last third of the film. I was also kind of expecting some kind of monster movie with the way the film was advertised, and there is no monster to speak of. I was expecting something akin to Jeepers Creepers when it came to who the grannie is and got none of that. Just some messed up old couple who were messed up. Was definitely expecting more of a slasher than what it was, which was again messed up old people doing weird, messed up things to these kids who are making a porno on their property. Some of the editing was good at first but entirely overused, such as the flashing between scenes. Way too much of that. My final bad thing was that fact that Brittany Snow sang a song that was randomly put in the film. It felt completely out of place with the rest of the material and it dragged the pacing down even further than it already was. I'm almost positive it was the only way she was going to agree to do a nude scene for this movie.Overall: All in all, it wasn't a bad film. Although it had cliched scenes here and there, and started out at a snail's pace, the plotline was definitely something I hadn't seen before and the focus of what movie was made here was pretty clear. Even if I felt the movie was misadvertised and marketed wrong. By the end of the movie, the title started making a lot more sense. If this movie had been released at the time period it was set it, 1979, it would have been rated X and probably be on a few lists in some countries. I enjoyed it for what it was.I would recommend it if you're a fan of 70's style exploitation films or horror films. If not, you probably won't have a great time and you will definitely be repulsed by the final third of the film.","

X," Great Film, But Takes A While To Get Going & Drags
",vengeance20,18-Mar-22,"So, I've came back from seeing this film & wasn't surprised as I sort of knew what was going to happen. I didn't see any previews so I sort of walked in blind while only knowing the name & brief story about this film.The film sees a group of adults in 1979 going off to rural Texas, Austin, 1979, to film a an adult film at a farm homestead & paying an elderly couple for them to rent out their cabin as a shooting location. But things take a dark turn as the couple seem to take a bizarre & creepy interest in what the young adults are doing.I found the film to be pretty great. It's well shot & well written. The story is creepy as with the message about jealousy & envy. The deaths are typical of any slasher of course, albeit the lake scene with the crocodile was pretty ace. It's gory as & has a great 70's/80's horror slasher feel to it which is great in itself. The eye candy is something else & there's some funny but disturbing parts also.The film did have some pacing issues though & took a while to get to the gory parts, the eye candy made up for it of course, but I did feel a lot of scenes dragged far too long than needed to be which sort of frustrated me a little. It's long for what it is at 101 minutes (1 hour 41 minutes).Overall, it's pretty neat slasher & as gory as the name suggests. It does take a while to get going, drags a lot, but the pay off in the final act is worth it.7/10.","

X," A bit of a let-down
",GregTheStopSign95,14-Nov-23,"I was expecting good things from this movie. After all, it's got a pretty solid cast - Brittany Snow returning to our screens, finally, Jenna Ortega definitely on the rise, Mia Goth making another 'quirky' character choice, Martin Henderson who's always reliable - and it got a lot of buzz about how great it's supposed to be...but it kinda missed the mark pretty badly for me.Don't get me wrong, the cast are great as I said, and the 'story' isn't terrible (but it's also not really 'there', truth be told), plus it's kinda cool to get a callback to the heady days of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies and it's pretenders...but this all ends up just being another pretender. The gore is good, there's a good bit of T&A titillation, the antagonists are creepy...all the ingredients are there for a great revival of the old 70s slashers, it just probably needed a bit longer in the proverbial oven.","

X," More A Homage To Slasher Films Rather Than a Pastiche.
",Pairic,23-Mar-22,"X: A Slasher film which is self referential in much the same as the recent Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were. Like them it's leavened with a strain of dark humour. It's 1979, six people set off to make an adult movie, the producer Wayne is determined to break into the emerging home video market and make his girlfriend Maxine into a star. The director, RJ, who wants to make an avant garde porn flick is joined by his uneasy girlfriend Lorraine on sound. Bobby and Jackson are two adult film actors. Arriving at the farmhouse location they are met by a crazy old man, Howard, wielding a shotgun, this combined with an old woman, Pearl, eerily staring out a window should have sent the alarm bells ringing. Wayne sweet talks the old man with money. The old geezer is suspicious of them but thinks they're just vacationing in his guesthouse. The filming commences but soon things go awry. This is a mixture of American Gothic, Wrong Turn and Deliverance with extremely violent and downright disturbing moments. One scene in particular features Pearl, slashing away, red lit by car lights, Don't Fear The Reaper playing on the radio is masterly. Indeed the film appears to pay homage to classic slasher films rather than being a pastiche. While the violence is extreme, there seems to be an inevitability to it once Pearl meets Maxine, dreams of her own lost youth and beauty and is jealous. There are a few plot twists, the old couple in particular harbour one or two little secrets. An unintentionally entertaining Fundamentalist Preacher is ranting in the background on TV in many scenes. Mia Goth is great as both Maxine and Pearl, with emerging Scream Queen Jenna Ortega as Lorraine. Written & Directed by Ti West. 8/10.","

It has a really well done slow burn where during the first half you get introduced to these characters while some getting a creepy feeling throughout. Then the second half rolls around and the horror truly begins.They did a really good job with the horror. The consistent sense of fear was really well done mainly because of the amazing cinematography at work. When the killing actually begins it has a lot of gore and some well timed jump scares. I thought it was unique how they involved the porn in the horror, I thought it was creative and something I haven't seen before.The acting across the board was great. This film had Jenna Ortega who is becoming more and more of a well known actress and she shows why in this film. Mia Goth did a great job as well along with Martin Henderson, Brittany Snow and Kid Cudi.There is one really good theme of growing old in this film and it explores how the older you become the less you can do. Having that element in a horror really enhances the film.In terms of gripes it is a horror film so you're gonna get your dumb victims it's inevitable. As well there were certain plot points that didn't make a lot of sense but I think that might just be me misunderstanding.Overall X is a creative horror film.

X," Surprisingly Not Trash
",infinitetyler,03-Dec-23,"I went in thinking ""Another low-budget slasher horror"", and I was wrong about ""another"" and ""low-budget"". Maybe this was filmed pre-Wednesday, but Jenna Ortega and Kid Cudi likely aren't cheap, and they dropped some serious needles on the soundtrack. The acting was great, the cinematography was great, and Ti West did an awesome job on the writing and direction. It dragged a bit towards the beginning, as these films tend to do, however a few of the things set up turned out to be Chekhov's Guns. The dialogue isn't remarkable, but there were times I was caught off guard by something realistic like ""oh yeah, that's probably what would actually happen if an 80lb octogenarian fired a gun"", and it attempts to address topics like aging and the meaning of love, which is ambitious for a slasher film. The characters had some depth, so I was invested in their struggles. There were multiple eye-roll moments, which goes with the genre. The special effects were pretty good.Since they were released in the same year I had to read the trivia to figure out this was filmed before Pearl, and while I thought the twist at the end of X was clever, the previews for 'Pearl' make it look like she was some kind of wacky killer before the start of X, which I think would hurt her character more than add to it.","

X," Simultaneously silly, sexy, scary, and revolting
",darkreignn,20-Mar-22,"I've come to think of film production company A24 as The Asylum of art-house films. Where The Asylum focuses on producing low-budget, direct-to-video films that use film titles and scripts very similar to those of current blockbusters in order to lure customers (shouts out to Wikipedia for that beautifully succinct synopsis), A24 also produces movies that - on first glance - look very similar to generic genre films; you don't have to look very far to find the proof of that. Films like ""Hereditary,"" ""Midsommar,"" and ""It Comes At Night"" all had trailers that marketed the films as scary movies that appealed to mass audiences. Those with some semblance of familiarity of A24's track record would know that the above mentioned films would have more up their sleeve, while others may find themselves taken by surprise by how ""different"" the movies are when compared to more mainstream fare. ""X"" is no different. With a trailer that, while stylistic, advertises itself as nothing more than just another slasher, ""X"" entices customers with an accurate premise, only to pull the rug from out under them once they are seated in the theatre.What I like most about A24 is its conviction to add an insane level of quality to what should be nothing more than a disposable Saturday night watch. ""X"" advertises itself as a grimy, bloody, slasher movie - and it is - but it's one that prides itself on its high production value. ""X"" is a slasher that actually cares about its story and its characters; remarkably, it is a horror film that works just as well when it's purely being a drama. Following a crew of filmmakers who are decidedly set on making an ""artistic"" adult movie, ""X"" is intent on character-building. With all the greed, jealousy, and lustfulness that you might expect from a group of young adults who enjoy making love with each other on camera for money, I was pleasantly surprised that I started to enjoy this movie purely on its own storytelling merits, before the real horror even began.With eye-candy all around in the form of Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega, and Brittany Snow (as well as Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson, and Owen Campbell - if you're into that sort of thing), what impressed me most about ""X"" is that, not only did director Ti West pack his movie full of people who can actually act, but he also has crafted characters that are fully fleshed out and feel like real people. Unlike your typical slasher, here characters actually make smart decisions and are not just stupid for the sake of being stupid. And this works twofold by drawing viewers into the story before the horror begins, and then amplifying it once it does.With ample care being taken in character, script, plot, and production value (and not to mention the rocking soundtrack), you can only imagine how much care was also taken in the kills. Yes, Ti West will be sure to gross you out here, because there is blood, guts, and gore aplenty, and all of it wrapped around a unique visual flair and editing style that ups the entertainment value and differentiates this movie from other slashers. There is creativity here, with people dying in unpredictable and uncomfortable ways; I definitely found myself cringing at many of the deaths. So if you enjoy bloody violence, you'll definitely find a lot to like here.If I had any complaints about this movie, which I do, it's that I found the tension building to be slightly lacking. You see, I quite enjoy slashers that have long, drawn out scenes of people trying to escape their murderers (""Scream,"" for example), and this movie didn't really have that. While I understand why exactly ""X"" could not have such scenes, it did make the killings slightly lackluster - as in, character goes to place, then they swiftly get killed in said place, and end scene. While the kills themselves are creative, there is a lack of creativity in the build up to those kills. Similarly, I did find the motivation of the killer(s) to be somewhat unclear. I mean, I understand why they were doing what they were doing, but I don't really think the motivation was all that believable. Also, I found the ending to be rather abrupt and not very climactic or fulfilling. All of that said, ""X"" remained to be extremely entertaining.""X"" won't be for everyone - when the movie ended, a middle-aged man turned to his date and said, ""That was the weirdest movie I have ever seen."" A couple sat next to me, and basically sprinted out of the theatre as soon as the credits rolled. However, its almost maddening attention to quality and detail elevates it above other, similar, slasher movies, making this one very memorable horror film.","

",ScorpioDog,05-Jan-24,"Unfortunately I just did not gel with this film at all. There are some things that I thought were interesting about it, but I probably will not re-watch this one again.One of the elements I liked was the themes presented in the narrative. Age, gender and sexual relationships are explored frequently. Sometimes I felt the dialogue was a bit heavy-handed in how it included these themes, but it was not too distracting. I loved how Mia Goth effectively played two different characters. She did really well!I feel like it just took too long to get to the main horror elements. I don't usually mind a slower-paced film, yet 'X' did not really keep me interested. A lot of the sexual scenes were just annoying to sit through. A lot of people enjoyed this one, so maybe check it out if you are interested.","

X," Don't over hype it.. it's Ti West being Ti West.
",TuesdayThe17th,19-Mar-22,"I love Ti West. His segment in the first vhs movie, second honeymoon, is by far my favorite segment. And I love The Sacrament as well. The Sacrament is better than this movie, for sure, but this is still one of Ti Wests better offerings. ..but wait, how can we compare such a big budget film with the rest of his indie level films? Because this movie is more of a top tier indie film rather than a blockbuster. It's cool that it's A24 and that definitely suits Ti West as he returns to form, but honestly this ain't no Hereditary or Midsommar. It ain't The Witch or The Lighthouse. It's a new type of beast for A24 overall with it being I thiiink their second slasher film release?Some good things about this movie is that it has that Ti West traditional minimalist approach and if you like his work, you will dig this. Another thing that's good was the whole gator aspect of it, with creepy threats lurking below the swampy surface all the while. The actors were definitely good but it's also hard to really say they were bad considering they all didn't get as much screen time as I had hoped. Brittany Snow spoke quite a bit through out but Kid Cudis character didn't say a whole lot. Also, Owen Cambell was especially good in a role that almost mirrored Lou Taylor Puccis character in the Evil Dead remake. Yeah, kinda a rip off, but who's to say two movies can't have the same type of characters? The kills were good enough, with a few of them being pretty extreme but not in like an over the top way. It's all done in fair taste.Now, something about this movie was missing.. I saw this in the theaters and personally I prefer watching new movies like this at home but I just couldn't wait to see wests newest work. I feel like the theater screen takes away from the crispness of a quality TV screen. Also, there is a little too little that goes on here and the porn scenes are wonky. I can see where West was headed but maybe the turn out isn't as good as people would have thought it'd be. Nonetheless, I did like it. I will buy it on 4k. And I will like it more on a second viewing as per usual.Until then,

",christofirebarrett,18-Mar-22,"Despite a good amount of gore, and some nude elders (no full frontal), X fails to shock. Every death happens so quickly no one has a chance to say ouch. It has the look of other A24 movies, bold compositions and strong colors, but behind that there's not much going on. There were gators established early on (in one of the most annoyingly A24 shots of the movie), built up some, and eventually misused in a very vanilla death scene near the end. X could have been fun if they didn't try to appear sophisticated, and took some cues from the type of film that it's about. Why in a movie about porn do we not see one (living) piece of genetalia?

They rent a cabin on an old man's farmland, and they are caught in the act, resulting in violent acts. That sounds great, sounds like all the making for a good/great horror movie. The plot twist in this is ridiculous, and not in a good way. My wife and I literally looked at each other and laughed. By the end of the movie, it was the first time I have ever felt and audibly said that the movie was a waste of my time.

",mochteam,26-Mar-23,This was a decent horror flick but it wasn't perfect or legendary. It's entertaining enough but it felt like something was missing from the film. I think it was a motive and character development. As soon as the characters started to become interesting they got killed off rather quickly. So they remained rather forgettable and disconnected from the viewer. The killers you never really learn their motive or why they do what they do. While this is an ode to 70's horror films I recall 70's horror films having some pretty good plots and story telling.It's not a bad film just one that seemed like it could have used 30 more minutes of plot/character development before getting into the heart of it.,"

",jtindahouse,11-Apr-22,"Someone once said 'Ti West is the best director you've never heard of."" It was me, I said that. This guy has been putting out quality horror films for years now and not getting anywhere near enough recognition. 'X' may be his best film yet. This one is a blast.This film created something very few modern horror films are able to - tension. I found myself very tense during this film. It's actually a very patient film though. The build-up is methodical and slow with only little hints as to what is to come. Because of the strong characters and dialogue though it is never dull or boring.Then when the action does kick in in the final third of the film it is a wild ride. All the pieces that have been masterfully set up fall into place and nothing is off limits. No character felt safe and I absolutely love that feeling in a horror film. The editing style ad the way it used in some of the horror sequences really caught me (and some other audience members) off guard. I had never seen anything like that in a film before, but it worked so well.There is some great chemistry amongst this cast. All six of the main leads nailed it. I have to say my jaw was hanging when I read that Mia Goth played both 'Maxine' and 'Pearl'. Are you kidding me? That is some truly incredible make-up work and acting.It sounds like we are getting a prequel to this film soon and I am here for it.

X," Ah, I was pleased
",BandSAboutMovies,18-Apr-22,"Consider the law of diminishing returns: X is the best slasher that I've seen all year, last year, the year before and probably for the rest of this year.It may also be the law of the desert island in that it may be the only slasher in years that approaches the blood-soaked heaven of 1978-1981, yet were it released then, would I feel the same way?And after seeing tweet after tweet about how debauched and filthy and sexed-up this movie was, did we see the same film? Or am I really the ""affable pervert"" that Grindhouse Releasing said I was and I've become too desensitized? Or, probably more true, has this generation become more puritanical and repressed than we were?Probably most importantly, I decided to just shut up and enjoy the movie.What I came away with was a film that actually gave me that uncomfortable and awesome feeling of ""I wonder what's next"" and a worry for each of its characters.Back in 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make a dirty film in rural Texas, learning nothing from another Texas-shot slasher. And when their elderly hosts discover what's happening, the cast find themselves in a way different movie.Reading that description, I felt sure that I would dislike this movie, but then again, this was Ti West, who somehow took a very basic story in The House of the Devil and made something great and lasting.I've been burned by an A24 trailer before. Come on, we all have. But again, I decided to shut up and watch the movie.And I'm glad that I did.Maxine Minx (Mia Goth, Nymphomaniac) dreams of being an adult film star and people knowing her name. This brings her to deepest, darkest New Zealand, err Texas, along with her producer/boyfriend/suitcase pimp Wayne (Martin Henderson), director RJ (Owen Campbell), his assistant/girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega, Scream) and two co-stars, Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow, the Perfect Pitch movies) and Jackson Hole (Kid Cudi!). As they go deeper into the rural world, we're reminded - of course - of that aforementioned Texas film, what with the van that propels them and the farmhouse they end up in.RJ has a goal. Just because it's porn doesn't mean that it can't be art, he says, almost like a non-burnt out Gary Graver. Wayne knows something more important: porno chic died because middle America is stil too afraid to go to a porno theater and still blushes when they buy a skin mag. But if they can have that movie in the safety of their home? He's ahead of the video era, Caballero and VCA before they'd even realized what was next. The themes of this movie are desire and age battling hand in hand and the fact that the new type of entertainment they're making is based on the oldest joke there is - The Farmer's Daughters - points to the intelligence of this endeavor.Meanwhile, there's Howard (Stephen Ure) and Pearl (also Mia Goth, we'll get to that shortly), the elderly couple who owns the land. Howard barks at everyone while Pearly stays in the shadows, except for the moment where she invites Maxine in for lemonade, a remembrance of youth, some jealousy and a rebuffed sexual December to May advance.That afternoon, Pearl watches Maxine and Jackson at work and begs Howard to make love to her one more time, but while the spirit and the emotional heart are willing, the flesh and the physical heart are weak.That night, Lorraine surprises everyone by asking if she can be in the film. RJ tries to use art as the reason why the script can't be changed; she defeats his argument and he watches her make love through the eye of his camera. That night, he leaves everyone behind but runs into Pearl and that's where - nearly an hour into the film - ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" plays and we're reminded of exactly what kind of movie we're in for.The end of the film surprised me. I should have seen it coming, but the repeated dialogue, the divine intervention and Greek chorus of televangelists all came together in a way that I had no idea was going to occur. Seriously, that preacher gives Estus Pirkle a run for his money.I also had no idea that Goth spent ten hours a day in makeup for the dual role, which she'll take up again in Pearl, a prequel that was shot at the same time as this movie.Even the soundtrack works, written by Tyler Bates and Chelsea Wolfe, who covers Fred Fisher's ""Oui, Oui, Marie."" What doesn't, however, is the moment where Snow and Kudi sing ""Landslide,"" as we've already established the closeness of the actors and this seems only in the movie to have them remind us they also do music.As bad as 2022's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, this is good. It feels closer to Eaten Alive, another Hooper film, what with the alligator scene - I winced when someone claimed this movie had a scene that echoed Alligator - and I love how the final girl is the least chaste character in the movie, continually doing drugs and putting herself first.Here's to more horror being committed to only being inspired by the past instead of wallowing within it, pushing itself to new heights. I was worried if West would ever come close to House again; my fears were unnecessary.","

X," Decent but surface level.
",W011y4m5,18-Jan-23,"""X"" could've very easily been great if it had dared to rise above the generic slasher piece it sadly became, transcending the horror genre by at least endeavouring to convey a meaningful message through the themes / subtext of its storytelling.At first, I presumed director & writer Ti West was attempting to craft a cautionary tale which depicted how men have a privileged, selfish flippancy & are happy to exploit women for their sexual gratification but when those same individuals of the female sex empower themselves by reclaiming their own bodily autonomy (taking their personal pleasure in to consideration & making emotional advancements in absence of their partners), males perceive that sudden lack of control & equality as victimisation & thus, conflict is borne from the misogynistic entitlement indoctrinated from living within a patriarchy, since they're incapable of processing the parity they're suddenly being expected to accept... Which perchance may have credibly been a fascinating point to emphasise within the confines of this film (contrasting one type of woman's body against that of a senior in a self aware juxtaposition to question why we associate one with sex / pornography & the other, horror - acknowledging the apparent ageism / unreasonable beauty standards we subconsciously normalise around those surrounding us), but alas - that was not meant to be.Instead, it then seemed to perhaps evolve in to a commentary on the animosity between generational divides within society, portraying the bitter resentment caused by the elderly generation's wasted youth throughout history etc. Or even people's insistence on killing not only themselves with old age, but dragging the young down with them, before they go (global warming / the rise of the far right within older demographics, for instance)... All of which might've also been interesting, had the concepts been developed & fully addressed, as opposed to half baked - at most. Sadly, that wasn't done either - & therefore, although there's a lot of potential brimming beneath the surface, I feel as though most of it was left unrealised in the final product.The cinematography is great, the performances are impressive & there's a lot of personality to the style of the visual filmmaking... Yet none of that (or any of the sexual content & explicit nudity) compensates for the lack of substance, narratively justifying the more provocative creative choices being made. Consequently, you could argue it inadvertently indulges in the voyeuristic acts it ostensibly condemns & resultantly forms something rather hollow. However, catching Sam Levinson's name as a producer in the credits kind of explains everything - & I needn't elaborate any further.","

",jfgibson73,26-Mar-22,"This was a pretty fun little movie. I think my favorite thing about it is how well it established the setting, specifically rural Texas in 1979. They kept the locations limited, but that meant they were able to ensure everything looked and felt exactly right for the time and place. The story builds slowly, and feels very predictable for the first half or so, but you get some surprises once the action picks up. After watching, I read a few articles and realized there was a HUGE amount of stuff I missed, so I'm already looking forward to re-watching it. They clearly put a lot of care into this one, and I would say it is well worth seeing. A well above average effort for a low budget horror movie.","

X," A retrospective slasher, looking back at the classics.
",movieman6-413-929510,19-Mar-22,"X is a new horror film directed and written by Ti West, the director of The House of the Devil.The film is set in 1979 where a group of young people try to make a new and unique porn film. They have found the right place for this in Texas, namely a ranch of a parental farmer couple. The youths try to keep what they use the ranch a secret from the parents, because they know they are committing sins in their eyes. If the youngsters are caught, everything changes and the youngsters suddenly have to fight for their lives.With this film, Ti West manages to make a good retrospective film, which looks back in a playful way to the beginning slasher films such as Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Apart from some twists and turns, it is unfortunately otherwise a standard slasher, trying to revive the classics. For example, the film is entertaining for slasher fans, but can also be a bit on the familiar or even predictable side.Like many slashers, the film has a slow pace, which gradually builds up over time to gory, filthy or scary scenes. For a more unique film, Ti West could have been a bit more creative, because apart from a hidden message in the film, the film is also a bit cliché. Slasher connoisseurs know in advance what is about to happen and where the film is going. As a result, they can lose interest in the film while watching.What works best in the film are the details that Ti West has used in the film. This way the place where the film takes place comes across well, because if you keep listening carefully you can hear the farming environment of the farm in the film. For example, you can hear the wind blowing through the grains or the crickets and other insects in the background. He also knows how to play nice with the camera because of the way he portrays things just to sometimes lead you as a viewer astray.The makeup effects also work well in the movie. Most of the blood and other gory things seem believable and even the parental couple who are actually played by younger actors really do come across as a bunch of elderly people thanks to their prosthetic make-up.The acting is also done well and appropriately by the film cast. Martin Henderson comes across as someone who is trying to make his own passion movie that is better than the rest of the movies that are being made. He just lacks the right insight to make this happen. Owen Campbell and Jenna Ortega try to help him as the people behind the camera, but sometimes end up in conflict with each other. Brittany Snow and Kid Cudi play the porn actors and know well the difference in the kind of acting they do compared to the official work of real actors. That way they know that their viewers won't be that interested in the story of the film, as long as they see their creations naked in the film. The best acting comes from Mia Goth, who again shows with this film that she is a daring actress, who does not try hard to make something special out of her roles. In this film she even plays a hidden double role. Jenna Ortega and Mia Goth show with this film how they grow as actresses in the film world.","

X," X marks the spot
",videorama-759-859391,02-Feb-23,"This Texas Chainsaw Massacre'ish, horror, rises above the norm of these type of slasher pics, thanks to a few smarts. While bits of it seem familiar, especially in it's starting, and where we could have had a bit more suspense, pre kill, here was an impressive horror, I enjoyed, much more than I thought I would, and will watch it again. Like TCM, this is also set in 73', where a budding adult film crew about to make their better intentioned, master porno flick, pick the absolute worst location to shoot it, where a demented old anti porn couple, have their own plans for this film troupe. There are moments and instances you don't expect, and this is what I really like, especially the crocodile tracking shot of beautiful Goth, who exudes such sex appeal in this, and owning the movie, while Kiwi, Hendersen is fantastic as her lover, and executive producer of fictional porno, a bit of a scummy, selfish pr**k. It's great, we have a lot of sex nudity, versus, a smaller extent of wholly satisfying, and in some scenes, sickening gore, cow carcass shot for one. This is an impressive horror film from an impressive director, and I would like to see more, of what this writer/director can do. Well acted horror, and it does kind of feel much character cliched, but it's the smart touches, and entertainment value I got from this. It's a very made horror, and Goth is something, indeed. Great, different, eerily effective music, score, this film can do no wrong, while offering humor too, plus the most repulsive, fornicating scene, ever put to film. .","

X," Predictable And Uninspired.
",meddlecore,23-Oct-22,"""Is it possible to make a good dirty movie? "" is the question that director Ti West poses in this vintage-style backwoods slasher pic.The story focuses on a hustler from Houston, who brings his young fiancé to a remote town in the bible belt, where he plans to shoot a series of interracial porn videos featuring her, a local stripper and Vietnam vet.His plan being to make his belle a star.West filters the above question through the character of the cameraman, who seeks to shoot the raunchy films like a more classy and respectable form of cinema.This all takes place in a flashback...with the intro revealing to us, that at some point...things took a very dark and violent turn.The group rents out a dilapidated old farmhouse- built during the revolutionary war- on a strange old man's property.But doesn't really bring him up to speed on their planned activities.When it all plays out...it feels like West was going for a backwoods slasher gore film with a bit of a giallo vibe.But it lacks the mystery that a good giallo film has entirely...as it is just way too predictable.Albeit creepily so.You can tell he is going for the shock value that films like TCM and Wolf Creek possess.But despite attempts to be lurid, it comes off way too tame.Leaving you waiting for that Bruno Dumont moment at the end...which never comes to fruition.So you can't help but feel like ""ugh"".As it comes off much too fake and lame.The ""old face"" costumes certainly didn't help on this front.They should've just cast some real, creepy looking, old people instead.Cause, in the end, there's a whole lot of atmosphere, but not a whole lot else.So the high expectations they build up in the beginning just go straight out the window.Going back to the question posed near the beginning...the answer is yes...but you're going to have to ask someone like Gaspar Noe or Pasolini.Not West.Because, wheras I do like his style...this one is a bit of a fail.It could have, and should have been better.The only redeeming quality I see in it, is that West writes his relationship with Mia Goth into it (in regards to him making her into a household name as ""his"" star).That is actually pretty cool.But that's about all it has going for it, in my opinion.3.5 out of 10.","

",brianjamez,08-Jan-23,"""It is possible to make a good dirty movie."" Well, apparently not. X is a bad dirty movie because it's slow-paced, boring, and unoriginal. It seems like they had a vague idea for a plot to establish the setting, then shrugged and said, ""I don't know. Then the killer starts killing people or whatever."" I kept waiting for the movie to start, if that makes sense. When are we going to get to know the plot? The characters? What is happening and why? What is the point of this movie?This is like if a 1st-year film student saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre and wanted to remake it, but only had a budget of 5 grand.","

X," Entertaining enough, you get what you came for
",Horst_In_Translation,03-May-22,"""X"" is a co-production between the United States and Canada that resulted in this really new 2022 English-language horror film. It runs for slightly over 100 minutes and I see this made it into the imdb top10 on the MOVIEmeter, so surely a big success and it was even higher, almost top5, the previous week. I got to watch this film on the occasion of a recurring horror event series at a local cinema and thought I'd share my thoughts with you now. Don't expect a great deal of structure. First of all, you could wonder what the title is about. It does not get any shorter than this. There is talk about one character having the so-called x-factor that separates her from the rest. Then again, if you triple the title, you will get a completely different meaning, namely ""sex"" that also fits in terms of the film's contents. I will get to that later on. The writer and director here is Ti West. He has been pretty prolific in the last 20 years with short films, full feature films and, most recently, television episodes, but this movie here has a really realistic shot at becoming his most known and most seen work so far. Maybe even his best. I see people (especially critics) liked the outcome, some even a lot, so we can be curious if he will move on to other genres in the future. Hollywood stuff. There has been a lot of focus on horror for him so far and like it happens so often with filmmakers from this genre, he also worked in many other production departments of his releases. As for the cast, the most known member you see on the photo here is Mia Goth, mostly thanks to her work with Lars von Trier and she is divorced from Shia Labeouf now, but still became a mom recently. Oh well, it is their private stuff, but I guess certain characters in this film would not like something like that too much either. Other cast members in here you may have come across in The Ring, Pitch Perfect, Need for Speed or the new Scream movie. One of them is maybe even more known as a musician than actor. Kid Cudi I mean of course.This is a film that fits the description of film on film. We have a gang of relatively young people who in the year 1979 plan on shooting an adult film inside a farm house they rented for this occasion. Of course, without telling the old owners about their intentions. The first meeting there is pretty heated already when the old man forgot who they are there and is ready to shoot the film's producer. Eventually it deescalates, but it is a bit of foreshadowing to everything that happens during one fateful night later on. That night is pretty much the violent center of the movie. Before that, a lot is implied and there is a great deal of tension, like also with the alligator that almost catches Goth's character without her realizing one bit, but not a lot of violence. We find out about the group mechanics, about the relationships the characters have with each other. I guess if you are a heterosexual male or homosexual female or just bisexual, you will certainly have a soft spot for one of the females in this film. There's a blonde who is a bit stuck-up, Goth's character, who is a self-confident brunette with big ambitions and finally the girl who is just an assistant with the microphone initially. The church mouse as she is called by another character repeatedly, but she also discovers some darkness inside her when she (not too unexpectedly) wants to act in the film as well. The brief initial conversation between church mouse and the blonde girl is also among the more comedic moments this film has to offer. I think it was ""yeah, sometimes"" what the girls replied in different contexts when being asked about their boyfriends. It sure is about the comedy here and there. Martin Henderson also gets in a solid amount. He reminded me a bit of Bradley Cooper and I mean that in the most positive way as I am not too big on Cooper. Like when he shows up only in his underwear on one occasion and tries to help another character in finding her boyfriend, it was a bit on the funny side. Also when he starts his little speech inside the barn it was funny how they made him look so experienced in life. That life was not meant to go on for much longer. What he steps on is bad enough already, but what happens later on is even worse.The guys get it way before the girls in here. You could even think that two of the girls maybe make it out alive in the end, but eventually it is just Goth's character. No surprise. She's the star. The other one with the dark hair, her actress is really, really young, was trapped in the cellar. Another horror film tradition and when she manages to almost get out, her captor is there to make sure she stays down. I found her reaction a bit exaggerated when Goth's character comes to help her, but maybe it was meant like this to depict the escalation that finally led to her death in that scene. And after all, after what she saw down there, it feels kinda justified to go full panic mode. With the adult film aspect in this film, you will also see a lot of nudity of course, some sex scenes, but it is never an adult film or so like the one they are shooting in this film. There is even a reference to another classic in terms of success they want to match with when one character mentions Debbie Does Dallas. Oh and the nerdy guy from the gang also gets in some comedy when he keeps talking about the artistic approach to his work and how he sees himself as much more than a porn crew member. A bit of a running gag. He was also if you want to call it that maybe the least superficial member from the gang. Surely a bit naive too and eventually it costs him and he is killed first. So yeah, you get to see nudity, but also West plays a bit with the audience there as if you want the young ones, you also have to sit through a sex scene between the old folks and Goth's character is right under the bed to witness it first-hand before she tries to get out. Then again, now I saw that Goth played the female there too, so a double performance. The older woman she portrays here will also get her own film apparently set back many decades in the past and West and Goth already worked on that one, so X will not stay the only film with these characters. Or of course only with the young characters, but Pearl/Goth will be back eventually.Okay, what else can be said about this one? I quite liked the farm setting, also that there are not too many characters and of course the number decreases as the film goes on. They had to get in the crocodiles as well after those did not succeed in getting their food on the first occasion. Really nice way to film it from up above, at that point still in broad sunlight. The death scenes are indeed pretty graphic with all the blood splattering. Not a film for the young ones. Bit it feels realistic, so all is good and how it should be. There is also solid depth to the characters and actually a bit of a touching story linked to the old ones, like how the old guy struggles with accepting the fact that he cannot satisfy his partner's lust anymore. Well, you see what happens when he goes for it in the end. At the same time, he develops some kind of hatred against the young people that come to his place and makes them fully responsible for enticing his wife. Take the gunpoint situation I mentioned already, but also when he is there with them and does not stare at one character because she turned him on, or at least not primarily, but because he just despises her so much. And also all the others. Early on, I thought it was just the old dame killing people, but he gets his share too pretty quickly. Oh yes, I must totally mention additional comedy moments. Most of all, the preacher you see on television. That was some really smart and interesting inclusion how he elaborates there and what he has to say exactly and how it sometimes fits the context of the film. Nicely done for sure. Also how his tape is still running when the police show up in the end. By the way, did the old lady die too then? I think she only broke her hip initially, but no clue when they got there and found them.Anyway, this Black police officer was a riot too. Already at the very start, but also at the end when he has no clue what sick events may have happened there at the farm. Or actually his very last words, the very final words of the film I am talking about: They were basically directed at the audience and this is where they created a parallel between the movie the young people were trying to make and the movie we were watching. Something really negative to say about this film? Maybe that we did not get to see Jenna Ortega during the act. Okay sorry, I know it is not an adult film. As for graphic moments, it is not just violence. Also look at cocaine (ab)use for example on two or three occasions. But nothing like that felt for the sake of it, so it is really nice. The quote that went basically like something how you should not live a life you do not deserve, but aim for something better instead was also one I liked and we heard it on a few occasions. The context or how the characters used it may have been a bit absurd, but the message behind it all is something I definitely approve of. Okay, this is it then. I am glad I watched this film and also glad that the room was pretty packed, actually so packed that they showed it a second time starting 20 minutes later for everybody who did not manage to get tickets for the initial showing. This is a film that deserves to be seen. And I think it will be, so it's all fine. Never dragged, which is good for a film as close to two hours as it is to the 90-minute mark. There is no hesitation at all for me in deciding that I give the outcome a thumbs-up here, maybe also because there are no supernatural elements, even if admittedly real greatness I also witnessed too rarely to say that this is close to a must-see. It is just a decent horror flick that will entertain you well from beginning to end I am sure.","

I watched X before Pearl, wanting to give her another go.

I think Mia Goth is more than capable of it. So fingers crossed for Infinity Pool.Back to X. Like I said, there was nothing new here. It wasn't shocking.

The reality of it was more underwhelming. I never found myself connecting to the characters, so when things start to go awry, I had no investment in their existence. They were just red shirts in a horror movie. I expected them to die and most of them met that expectation. It was fine.

If not, these people clearly watched a different film.Over 1/2 of the film is dedicated to establish the plot and character development. Note to director. This is in the horror genre and the plot is people making an adult film in Texas. Yep, that is all it takes.When the actual horror takes place it is so underwhelming and predictable. And for all of the time the director takes to set the plot and background to make a different type of film he falls into the same pattern of excessive blood. When the first victim gets it, he has enough blood to paint the entire front of the van.And lets get to the actual reason for the killings. A 100+ year old woman just wants to get laid. Really? No supernatural. No mysterious creatures, No grand idea. So if the husband just gives her what she wants - there is no murders and no plot??Not going to give away all of the characters but suffice to say the really bad make up will keep you guessing for about 2 seconds. I know they were shooting the prequel at the same time but next time actually hire old people to play the old people.Not going to give away the last ""shocking twist"" but wow - lazy writing.

X," A no-holds-barred homage to the slasher era! [+72%]
",arungeorge13,16-Apr-22,"Ti West comes up with one of the campiest slashers in recent times - one that utilizes its tropes exceedingly well. I loved how he slowly built up the characters and the atmosphere in the first hour, followed by an all-out sanguinary final half-hour. West also manages to extract not one but two solid performances from Mia Goth (Maxine and Pearl) while giving the rest of the ensemble their moments to shine. Alongside the performances, two aspects of the film really stood out - the special effects and the eerie score (by Tyler Bates and Chelsea Wolfe). There will be at least a few queasy moments even for hardcore slasher fanatics, strengthened by the shot selection and fantastic intercuts.Set in 1979, when the porn industry was on the rise right beside televangelism (questioning peoples' morals), the film uses several motifs that jump-cut between a televangelist's sermon and situations of inescapable doom. There are many shots that'd stay in my mind longer than they should - blood-lit headlamps, the recoil of a shotgun, the silent presence of an alligator, the unexpected use of a pitchfork, intercourse between an elderly couple (erm!), and more. This is a gory tribute to the slasher era, which surprisingly works well because the writing is careful enough to give sufficient texture to both the protagonist and the antagonist(s). Bring on the prequel!","

The trailer really hooked me a couple months ago and I always said to myself that this movie looks very interesting and it fully delivered.Although I would prefer both Hereditary and Midsommar over ""X"" that goes to say I still enjoyed the hell out of this one... even if it was more disturbing than both of Ali Aster's gems. This movie certainly is not for everyone and honestly probably not for most people; but I think it will end up being one of my favorite movies of the year. Definitely go out and see this one.","

X," X
",henry8-3,20-Oct-22,"A group of young people have hired a farm building on an elderly couple's Texas farm, to make a porn film. However, the barking mad couple, driven by televangelism, their belief in their rights to defend their property, coupled with an apparent hatred and jealousy of the young are keen to put the team in their place.Whilst by the end of the film you cannot point to anything particularly different here, this is well made and director Ti West knows how to spook and scare and when to unleash the gore - and there is plenty of it. The cast does well and Mia Goth is suitably enigmatic through the visceral proceedings and even if it doesn't scare you, it leaves you with doubt as to whether that holiday in rural Texas is a good idea.","

X," A little bit uneven
",okpilak,15-Nov-23,"Having lived through that era, perhaps the movie meant more to me than for much younger people. The movie is very minor porn, major horror, which is towards the end of the movie. Wayne is a director, and he sees the home market for porno movies as very lucrative. He has the blonde (Bobby Lynne), the stud (Jackson), his girlfriend Maxine, the camera man RJ and his girlfriend, Lorraine, the sound person. They even have a script. In the era it is set (1979) small hand held cameras, all-in-one, were not a thing. One can quibble that he would need lots of lighting, but that is not bad for this movie. RJ also wants to film with a nod to more European artistic touches. To keep things low key, Walter had rented a building on a remote southern farm, owned by an old couple, Howard and Pearl. They were married before WW I, and Pearl was a dancer, and is very aware of her faded looks. And Howard declines sex, as he is afraid of a heart attack. Things seem to be a bit creepy, but after Lorraine wants a role in the picture, RJ decides to storm off, take the van and strand everyone. Bad idea, and this is when the horror starts. There are parts of the movie that are done extremely well, and other parts more mundane. Where ever there is a TV set, the fire and brimstone TV preachers were doing their thing.","

X," Good action, but a disappointing second act
",mieriks,28-May-23,"This movie, about a group of young filmmakers who set out to make an adult movie in rural Texas, is an okay beginning of The X Trilogy (2022-).First of all, I think the actors were great. They were quite convincible, and they managed to make some sort of connection to me. I had no idea that Mia Goth played both Maxine Minx and Pearl, which really proves how well the makeup was done! The cinematography was great as well. Its vintage-like color palette with excellent lighting and the camera motion created appealing visuals that helped making the movie's atmosphere.The movie had some good scenes in the beginning despite the slowness, and things seemed slowly stranger and stranger after when the main characters had arrived at the farm. This created a certain suspense, and it really got my interest. Pearl was interesting to begin with, and it felt strange when she expressed her own sex drive while dreaming of becoming young again, which she apparently had lost, according to what she said. She suddenly went to unusual places around the farm, and a couple of characters started to notice, which obviously turned out bad from here.The second act was the disappointing part to me. It was quite flat and non-dynamic, which gave me some boring feeling sometimes. There were only unimportant dialogues, and too much sex, even though it was one of the big themes of this movie. The final act was decent itself, but I think it got some negative influence by the second act, which didn't really fulfill my enjoyment. Pearl wasn't that scary anymore, I think, and therefore I felt that I wanted more of something else. I just expected more. I think the main reason is that Pearl opened herself too much for us, which made me feel compassion of course, but because of that, while she was the antagonist, she lost that antagonist factor.In conclusion, while the movie showcased strong performances, impressive cinematography, and an intriguing setup in its first act, it faltered in the second act, lacking dynamism and meaningful dialogue. The initial suspense and eerie atmosphere gradually diminished, and the antagonist's impact weakened. Despite its decent final act, the negative influence of the second act dampened overall enjoyment. Expectations for a more compelling resolution were left unfulfilled. Ultimately, the movie's potential was hindered by a narrative imbalance, preventing it from fully delivering on its promising premise.","

Fortunately, in the case of X it worked very well. The film has a very different story from other films in the genre, even down to the motivation of the antagonists. It is a film that causes a certain discomfort, along with a very great tension and it is in these moments where the film manages to shine the most. It's definitely not a movie for everyone, because of its story and the scenes of violence. But, if you watch the movie with an open mind, you might like it.","

",overconsumer450,24-Jun-23,"I originally watched this film as an introduction to Mia Goth's acting, which I must say is incredible this film. I was thrilled to see such a star studded cast including Jenna Ortega and Brittany Snow. That being said I think the writing did not live up to the casts potential. If you are looking for a nostalgic 70's/80's style slasher film, this might fit the bill. Motives of characters in this film left a lot to be explained and fell short in my eyes. That being said, this film serves as the introductory film to the prequel, ""Pearl"" which is far more better excecuted and ""X"" is totally worth the watch just to experience ""Pearl"" in all it's glory. Overall, his film was good but not great. However, I look forward to the character development in the partner films surrounding this plot line.","

",quinnox-1,05-Dec-22,"This movie, while better than most of the standard horror schlock being produced by Hollywood in recent years, at least is a throwback to the classic 1970s horror era. But it falls woefully short of actually being a good movie in its own right.Its filmed in a nice style, with high class camera work and does a good job recalling the era, with classic 1970s cars and an era appropriate gasoline station, and other nostalgic items present from the 1970s, but after a promising start, the rest of the film takes place in a boring remote rural house setting. This is much more a black comedy than a proper horror movie, and it has zero suspense.The actors try their best, but aren't given anything to work with, with bad dialogue, and no character development. The movie is also very slow paced, and when things do start happening, its too late, and even then, the action is pretty dull and forgettable.It gets points for being a cut above many really bad horror films lately, but it would be a much better use of one's time to actually go watch a classic 1970s horror movie instead.","

X," This Movie is Unbelievably Stupid
",thalassafischer,15-Apr-23,"And so is Ti West, apparently, because if he were a little sharper he'd have picked up a bit more on Tobe Hooper's subtlety, darkness and Southern Gothic flair in superior flicks that obviously inspired this heap of trash; most notably the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Eaten Alive (1976). Tobe Hooper was actually from the South and it's painfully obvious that Ti West has about as much of a grasp on real Southern American culture as he does about rutabaga farming in the south of France.This is just painful to watch. The characters are caricatures, and it's not even artfully done with sly humor in the way Rob Zombie can pull similar stunts off. The comedy is low brow, adolescent, and literally no one in the porn industry behaves the way the strippers do in the first 20 minutes of this film. The fact that Ti West actually believes sex workers are more excited about sex work than oh say going for a swim, going out for drinks, or just reading a book in their bedroom speaks volumes on West's ignorance on the nature of adult entertainment. Ti West clearly doesn't get that sex work is WORK.And what is UP with the COW scene? Tobe Hooper's original masterpiece was a criticism of the brutality and barbarity of factory farming (and Hooper was in fact a vegetarian at the time he made Chainsaw) and to me this scene in X looks like average ""meat troll"" on Twitter having a borderline sociopathic giggle about animal cruelty. Is it a clumsy device that is supposed to show us what disgusting people the main characters are?This movie is just unbearable. I honestly would hate Ti West now if Pearl hadn't redeemed him in some fundamental way.","

The gore is one of the movies best qualities.However the climax and the whole 3rd act isn't all that interesting and becomes a big bloody fest...... just not an enjoyable one. It is a slasher and a sexy one or so it thinks.... It turns out a bit flat in its sexiness but I guess it was good to see a proper no holds barred attempt at inhibited sex scenes that felt raw and untamed, to see some unabashed nudity and then to see all of it get chopped off!!!Its a misguided one.. a misguided attempt to make a tribute to slasher films and also to explore the relationship between sex and violence...the end result isn't all that satisfying.","

And what separated ""X"" from lets say a mindless blood bath ""Texas Chainsaw"" series is that ""X""'s body horror is kinda justified in here - in some twisted way i did felt for killers here, i got the idea what they were missing. That is way screenplay of ""X"" goes above those brainless blood bath movies. I also liked the dirty style almost like grindhouse picture that clearly was made on purpose.Overall, given it low budget this is very well made movie because although being a body horror movie it actually kinda justifies kills or at least tells them in a bit fresh way.

The cinematrography is what hurts the most: they had the talent, the actors, the budget to do something amazing.Instead, they created a post-modern slasher flick that is as pretentious as it's light on ideas. You can almost smell the caviar and petit four at the launch party, mocking the 'little people' who didn't understand how great this film was.PS: potentially the worst ending of any non-ironic films out there to boot.Watch something good instead, like ""hereditary"", also by A24 and far, far,.. no - infinitely better.","

This film was such a surprise that I'm going to leave it up to you to find out for yourself. What I am going to tell you, is the premise. Amateur porn film makers go to a secluded ranch - owned by a creepy old couple - to make their film.

Even the second act is pretty tame for a horror movie, but hell, that third act sure do make up for it!'X' is horror movie with substance, and I enjoyed each and every character.

And I was fine with that.

X," Mia Goth & Jenna Ortega make Ti West's ode to classic slasher films a thrilling ride!
",tkmce2008,27-Sep-22,"Finally, getting a chance to write about this. I love slasher films and 2022 has been an iconic year for the genre. The resurrection of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series (pathetic to say the least), the forthcoming finale to the Halloween Movie series and the 6th entry in the Scream Movies (which also features Ortega). But what stands out in this crowded genre is Ti West's fabulous X.Set in the late 70s, the film follows a crew of young filmmakers, who rent a farmhouse from an elderly couple to shoot an adult movie. But when they are caught in the act, the group is forced to run for their lives.Ti West resurrects a genre that has gone through so many changes over the past 5 decades. X plays out as an homage to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was also set in Texas and had a group of friends being hunted by the locals. West brings his own twisted but refreshing vision to X to give us a satisfying slasher flick.Mia Goth, is stellar as Maxine, an aspiring adult film star. Joining her is Jenna Ortega as a crew member, Brittany Snow, Scott Mescudi, Martin Henderson & Owen Campbell.Ti West shot a prequel back-to-back with X. Titled Pearl, the film released in theatres a week back. There is also a sequel to X that is currently in production.X is definitely not for the faint hearted. West gets very creative with the kill scenes. But if you are a fan of slasher flicks, then X and it's prequel/upcoming sequel should be right up your alley.","

",jboothmillard,02-Apr-22,"I spotted this scary movie listed at a few of the cinemas, I was intrigued by the title, I became interested because of the leading actress from A Cure for Wellness, and the plot sounded interesting, so I went for it. Basically, set in 1979, Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is a pornographic film actress embarking on a road trip through Texas with her producer boyfriend Wayne (The Ring's Martin Henderson), fellow porn stars Bobby-Lynne (Pitch Perfect's Brittany Snow) and Jackson Hole (Scott Mescudi aka Kid Cudi), director RJ (Owen Campbell) and RJ's girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) to shoot an adult movie for the booming video market. Bobby-Lynne and Jackson start to become romantic, Lorraine is unimpressed with the content of the film, and RJ is wanting to make it seem like a serious piece of cinema. Wayne has arranged for the group to stay at the farm of elderly couple Howard (Stephen Ure) and Pearl (Mia Goth) who have a guesthouse. Howard is temperamental towards the group and carries a shotgun while Pearl is entranced by Maxine and silently stalks her. The group intends to shoot on location, without the couple's knowledge, with a farm related theme and storyline. Filming commences with Bobby-Lynne and Jackson having sex. Meanwhile, Maxine wanders up to the couple's house, she is invited inside by Pearl who offers a drink of lemonade, they have a conversation. Pearl laments her age, expresses jealousy for Maxine's youth, and makes a sexual advance towards her. Maxine returns to the group a little shaken by Pearl's behaviour but calms down. She films her sex scene with Jackson, she and the others are unaware that Pearl is watching from outside and is aroused. Following what she has seen, Pearl pleads with Howard for them to have sex, but he refuses, reminding her that he has a weak heart. Night falls and the film crew relax in their farmhouse. Lorraine is usually prudish, having assisted filming the performers have sex, and being intrigued and turned on, she wants to shed her reputation, but RJ is upset when she asks to be in the film. Wayne says that Lorraine can make her own decisions and allows her to take part if she wants to, and eventually RJ agrees to shoot a scene between Lorraine and Jackson. But RJ becomes so furious over her unfaithfulness that he intends to drive away while the others are asleep. He is shocked by Pearl, who suddenly appears and attempts to seduce him; he is repulsed and pushes her away, so she pulls out a knife and stabs him to death. Lorraine and Wayne notice RJ is missing and go looking for him. Wayne wanders into a barn after hearing noises, and gets a nail stuck in his foot, before being stabbed in the eye through a peephole, and with a pitchfork by Pearl. Lorraine approaches the couple's house and is invited in by Howard who claims Pearl is missing. He asks Lorraine to get a flashlight in the basement, she finds it, then screams in terror seeing the rotting corpse of a missing man and trying to flee she finds the basement door has been locked. Jackson gets out of bed and Howard arrives asking him to help him find his wife. Meanwhile, Pearl enters the guesthouse and climbs into Maxine's bed naked. While searching the woodland area, Jackson finds a pond with a car submerged in the mud, then Howard appears and shoots him dead, revealing himself to be complicit in Pearl's violent tendencies. Back at the house, Lorraine finds an axe and breaks her way through the door to reach the lock, only for Howard to attack her, breaking her finger and forcing her back down. Maxine wakes and screams finding Pearl lying naked next to her. Pearl walks out the house, with Bobby-Lynne witnessing and following her to the lake. Bobby-Lynne tries to take Pearl back to the farm, but Pearl angrily insults her. Bobby-Lynne scoffs at her before being pushed into the lake where she is eaten by an alligator. Maxine sees Pearl and Howard return to the guesthouse and hides under the bed. The elderly couple talk about the murders before having sex. Maxine manages to crawl out from under the bed and runs to the crew's van, finding RJ's dead body, and the keys missing. Maxine grabs a pistol from the van's glovebox and enters the farmhouse, finding and freeing Lorraine, who angrily blames Maxine for what has happened. Lorraine panics and runs out the front door, only to be fatally shot by Howard. The elderly couple intend to frame the crew as intruders on their property and start to move the bodies. Lorraine splutters before dying, startling Howard, and causing him to have a fatal heart attack. Maxine holds Pearl at gunpoint, who begs her to help her husband, she demands the keys to the truck. She attempts to shoot Pearl only to discover that the gun is unloaded. Pearl takes Howard's shotgun and attempts to shoot Maxine, but the force from the shotgun blasts her out of the house. Pearl lies helpless on the ground with a broken hip and begs Maxine for help. Maxine refuses and she shouts insults her, until Maxine runs her over with the truck, crushing Pearl's head. Maxine is the lone survivor and drives away from the farm. The next morning, the police have arrived at the house. An evangelical programme is seen frequently playing on Pearl and Howard's television, and on the programme, it is revealed that Maxine is the daughter of a conservative Christian preacher (Simon Prast). Sheriff Dentler (James Gaylyn) is informed that a film camera (RJ's) has been found, and the officers speculate about what it contains. Also starring Geoff Dolan as Deputy, Matthew J. Saville as Officer Mitchell, and Bryony Skillington as Store Clerk. Goth is becoming something a scary movie regular, she is terrific as the lead, but also unrecognisable and highly creepy as the horny old woman, Ure is equally nasty as her hubby helping her fulfil her sick fantasies, Snow is amusing as the ditsy promiscuous porn actress, and there is good support from Ortega, Kid Cudi and Campbell. It is a simple and familiar concept, a group of young adults wind up at the wrong place at the wrong place, with a pair of psychopathic pensioners, it is obviously influenced by and pays homage to classics like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Psycho and The Shining. The sexual stuff is very reminiscent and certainly looks like something out of the 70s, while the scares mostly come from how bizarre the old characters are and the grizzly gory deaths, I'm glad it was the kind of film I was expecting, a worthwhile erotic slasher horror. Good!","

X," I'm sorry to admit, but the hype around this did influence my experience with it
",youngcollind,01-Nov-22,"Since the response has been above and beyond that of your average slasher, I went in expecting something special. While it certainly does a lot of things well, part of it's ethos is a loving embrace of horror conventions, which though adeptly handled, are still limited by the pitfalls of the genre.Ti West made a name for himself pulling the brakes on over the top scares with a return to the pacing of classic films, and X continues in this tradition. He gives weight to the characters and extends the preamble one beat longer than you'd expect, which gives a feeling of cathartic release to the fantastically gory first kill. Due to my preconceptions about the film, I thought they had introduced the surly old man as misdirection, and was surprised and a little disappointed when they doubled down on ""creepy old people"" as the main theme. I can see how this allowed for some insightful commentary on fleeting youth and the unfortunate way society discards the elderly, but it also struck me as an odd choice to go with Mia Goth in prosthetics over an actual senior. Don't get me wrong, the makeup and acting were great and I totally didn't know it was her until afterwards, but I could definitely tell it was fake. If we're going to focus on the horrors of aging bodies, I'd like to see some aging bodies.Once the cat's out of the bag, it intentionally runs through classic slasher beats as it picks off the rest of the cast. It's formulaic but entertaining, and I did really like the one two punch of the gator bit. It's also impressively littered with little details, like subtle foreshadowing, sly meta references and mini homages to Psycho, The Shining and especially The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It all comes off a bit like some kind of gourmet hamburger, and try as they did to go the extra mile, it's still made of the same basic ingredients as the most readily available fast food.","

",christopher-underwood,08-Jan-23,"I liked the idea of it set in the seventies and a couple of kids and a camera, and a boom, setting of in their van to a terrible old bit of a desolate countryside and almost abandoned farm buildings. Just the wonderful place to make their porn picture, oh and the two old people. It appears that they are very old and it seems that they might not notice at all as they start stripping off. The problem is that we know exactly what is going to happen. The music is great and the action inside and out but we just know what is going on, even if they don't. Unfortunately it is also very slow so we seem to be ahead all the time and as it gets towards the last half hour it seems to become rather silly. I wanted to like the film and I didn't hate it but if it had been a bit sharper it might have seemed okay.","

X," Not a slam dunk, but offers a lot more than the average horror movie
",Jeremy_Urquhart,30-Mar-22,"X takes a while to get to the more outwardly horror elements in its story about a group of young people in the late 1970s who shoot an adult movie at a farm owned by two mysterious elderly people, who don't react well when they find out.Right before the violence and suspense really kicks into overdrive, there's a great montage that uses Fleetwood Mac's 'Landslide' that was unexpectedly emotional, and it made me almost wish it wasn't about to turn into a full blown horror movie.I say almost because the horror stuff is still pretty good, and considering there's a ton of less than stellar horror movies out there, it's always good to see one that's well-executed, polished, and well-acted. X is all of those things, with a first half that feels more like a dramedy, and is pretty compelling while it's basing itself in that genre.It's a film of two halves, and knowingly accepts that, what with a reference or two to Psycho around the halfway point, and some general meta-commentary throughout that thankfully didn't become too frequent or overbearing. If as a result there's a good thematic reason for this divide, I may not have understood it, and if there is some deeper meaning to it, that's on me for not getting it.I also wondered why the old age makeup wasn't prticularly great, but then read some stuff about the movie afterwards that made me accept it. To explain anymore might be a spoiler.X is very good, even if I didn't quite love it. It was mostly a good watch though, and I thought of the cast, Mia Goth was really good, and it would be cool to see her in more horror movies, as she nails her part here.","

X," You Get The X Factor
",statuskuo,19-Mar-22,"""X"" is that type of movie that would've been a straight to video horror flick you discover when you use to be able to bulk rent videos and keep them for a week. It shares much DNA with flicks like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and well...anything A24. In other words, cult.Director TI West gives you a very enticing premise, a group of scuzzy sex merchants want to make a porn, so they rent a (what would be now known as an AirBNB) rental home to shoot a porno. Things go awry when the strange old couple who rent the property start to infuse themselves into their shenanigans.Now, the plot itself is pretty wild and makes you ask a TON of questions...for instance, what if the couple got normal tenants? What if police were more involved in disappearances of travelers? Same questions you would ask in most horror films.So anyway, the ensemble is solid for their portrayals of 70's youth. Free spirited. A lot can be said about the commentary of youth culture and how it may aggravate some. In my case, I started to identify more with the killers at one point. They are obnoxious young'ins. However, this is how we all were when we were young.This movie will leave a bad taste in a lot of people's minds. This isn't going to be a who-dunnit. As they give away the murderer right away. It does have moments that are cringy, The killings have a gushy gore style to them. For the squeamish (again, like myself) it is uncomfortable.Kudos to Mia Goth, whom I've not seen much of. This seems to be a bridge to more adult roles. This isn't the same road as Platinum Dunes style young folk who do horror films that are really action films. The remake of ""Texas Chainsaw"" with Jessical Biel comes to mind. This has a lingering eerie quality that is more synonymous with A24.For the most part, I can imagine an audience openly ooh'ing and arg'ing at a few points. And sometimes laughing at looped dialogue. It does give you a sense of dread for the unsuspecting victims. Where it fails is sometimes...you feel that they are just cardboard characters for us to cheer at their deaths (a sickening feeling).Stick around past the end credits to see the prequel to this film called ""Pearl""","

X," Stylish homage
",guskeller,21-Mar-22,"X is a stylish homage, embodying 70s filmmaking with risque content, methodical pacing, and purposeful presentation. The story follows a group of pornographers who rent a cabin from a strange elderly couple. The script consistently builds tension but reserves horror for the end. Instead, the beginning focuses on characters and eerie atmosphere. Consequently, the characters are interesting. Each perspective contributes to the narrative, the dialogue is cleverly meta, and there are themes about sexual repression and the fleeting nature of beauty. These themes aren't fully realized, but still matter. Thus, the writing feels occasionally shallow but, overall, has substance.Technically, X shines. The cinematography uses film (rather than digital), extreme long shots, overheads, push-ins, and surreal lighting to heighten the mood. Abstract sound punctuates messages and emotions. Match cuts and stuttered editing emphasize connection between scenes. The music is era appropriate, including a perfect use of Don't Fear The Reaper. The naturally grungy production design sells the time period. The effects are vivid and impactful. Also, the casting of the old woman is both surprising and thematic. Ultimately, X is skillful and attempts to elevate its genre. It doesn't completely succeed but still excels as a sharp experience.Writing: 7/10

X," ''There wasn't anything he wouldn't do for me back then. That's the power of beauty''
",Clintborari,03-Nov-23,"I had been eager to watch ""X"" in theatres upon its release. Unfortunately, I never got the chance. However, when I finally viewed it, I found it exceeded my expectations, standing out as one of the best horror films I've seen to date.Ti West demonstrates a keen ability to tell an enthralling story, and with ""X,"" he sets the stage for a potential franchise that could leave a lasting mark on the horror genre. While ""X"" may follow a linear narrative, West adeptly endows each character with a distinct personality, incorporating all the elements that make this film truly memorable. The cinematography is striking, capturing both the upbeat and troubled moods, and painting a vivid picture of the farmhouse, barn, and lake, all contributing to the film's eerie atmosphere.The film takes its time building towards the more gruesome moments, but when it arrives, it doesn't hold back on brutality. The well-timed jump scares are especially effective, seamlessly complementing the ruthless nature of the killings.The elderly couple, Howard, and Pearl, appear innocent enough, yet an unsettling feeling lingers. The film avoids over-exaggeration, portraying them instead as isolated elderly individuals who can be grumpy and lonely. It's Pearl's eerie wanderings and intense stares that provide the only clues that something isn't quite right.There aren't many criticisms to give the film either. The acting was exceptional, the surroundings were well-crafted, and the movie went along at a steady but intriguing pace.One scene in the barn where Wayne (Martin Henderson) looked through two small holes got me thinking of one of my worst fears. I have almost dreamt about this scenario and therefore am hesitant to look through anything with a small opening. Not only did I jump, but I also physically cringed at the sharpness of the moment.Another was with RJ, when he meets Pearl trying to leave in his pickup truck. The uncomfortable encounter and vicious and relentless stabbing that followed kept me highly on edge.Pearl's vulnerable state lying next to Maxine, stripped of her dignity and beauty over time, was a poignant portrayal of her desperation to cling to fading glory days.Mia Goth's portrayal of both Maxine and Pearl was nothing short of astounding. The performances by Jenny Ortega (Lorraine) and Kid Cudi (Jackson) also showcased a seasoned level of acting.""X"" distinguishes itself as a character-driven narrative, steering away from the mindless hack-and-slash formula. Each character possesses a mysterious yet intriguing backstory, evoking genuine empathy. The film fearlessly delves into themes of youth, drugs, sex, jealousy, and the challenges of aging.The story itself is quite complex and thoughtfully constructed. Horror elements from various genres are incorporated beautifully and don't come across as cliché or eye-rolling, but rather add a fresh uniqueness to something new and indulging.I appreciated the attention to detail, such as RJ's reference to French filmmaking techniques, signalling his desire for a narrative-rich story rather than a mere smut film. This choice becomes one of the many reasons for his reluctance to involve his girlfriend Lorraine, visibly affecting him both mentally and physically.In the final scene, a deputy discovers the camera amid the grim surroundings, prompting him to ask the sheriff what he believes it contains. The sheriff's response, ""Well, by the looks of everything, I'd say one goddamn f'd up horror picture,"" which perfectly captures the film's ideology.In conclusion, ""X"" is a must-watch for horror enthusiasts. While it may not completely redefine the genre, it has undeniably laid the foundation for the careers of at least two actresses. The inclusion of both an open and closed ending offers a welcome departure from the often bleak and sinister nature of similar films.9/10.","

Director Ti West did a great job here and shows that you don't need a big budget to make a great horror movie. The premise is pretty straight to the point but there is still more substance to be found under the layers. Now X will not be for everyone because of how graphic it is. Anyone who has read the synopsis of the film knows it is about a group of people who spend the night on an old couples property to film a XXX film. We then get to meet an old lady Pearl who we find out is not all there and seems to be set off by the group of people who are visiting. Things escalate from there and revelations are discovered. This is how a horror film should be done. X gets an 8 out of 10 from me.","

It is ultimately nothing, on the contrary and on this point it is a little disappointment, nothing will be really surprising despite a really successful atmosphere, with in the background the image of the couple that breaks in front of these women who claim their sexual freedom. But unfortunately the purpose of the film, remains very surface, clean to what offers a beautiful plastic that still holds breath.The characters suffer from a real lack of development to truly stand out. Of all this there remains however a very pleasant moment insofar as we appreciate the film for what it is: A better teen film than usual. It's really a shame that the film misses its subject a little because of lack of audacity which is quite ironic in the end when we remember its title.

X," ""Their Eyes Are Gonna' Pop Out of Their Damn Skulls When They See This.""
",mattstone137,18-Mar-22,"From the upstanding citizens at A24 comes X, a film reminiscent of those good ole' 70s flicks in both style and structure. Ti West, who has dabbled in horror and television throughout his career, writes, directs, and produces, lending the film a personal, suspenseful touch. X is a straightforward film, with many of the classical slasher trappings, like the rural setting, gas station detour, and warped sense of puritanical morality. It boasts few surprises but is steadfast and deliciously languid enough to be engaging. The viewing experience is a counterbalance between unfulfilled mystery and gory, kinetic thrills.The film follows a group of six young adults as they make a pornographic film in the nearby boardroom of an elderly couple. Our heroes are in it for money and fame, hoping to latch onto the currently blooming industry of porn-on-video. But as day turns to night there are sinister happenings afoot and the promise of sensual delights is suddenly much less sweet.The most persistent element of the film is reverence for the style and aesthetics of 70s film. X's mode of suspense is usually pitched somewhere between breathtaking and harrowing, and features the avantgarde scene transitions of Easy Rider. I failed to understand the choice in that film, and I fail to understand it in X; there's simply no relevant information in the frequent, jumpy juxtapositions. Although X has many 70s trappings, it only passingly succeeds in evoking the independent attitude and existential dread of that era. The emulation, like most concerns beyond the gore, seems underbaked and purposeless.The film's greatest asset is its patience and gradual build of dread. West's camera roves and watches, peeking through swampy marshes and through windows to give the sense of eerie voyeurism, much like a viewer expects from the type of smut our protagonists are filming. The film has time to breathe, often opting for longer takes and an enhanced sense of place and spatial continuity. For all of the breezy porno style and action during the day, X is ultimately a film of shadows, of creeping gremlins and unseen dangers. If nothing else, it's an engaging and entertaining watch, even if the pieces don't quite add up.Although the film works moment to moment, it never fulfills greater expectations, either structurally or thematically. This is a premise which promises twists, shocks, and gob smacking revelations, but delivers on little more than suspense and gore. There's nothing under the surface, nothing to satisfyingly explain the many character quirks throughout and nothing which adds any depth or complexity to the religious pretext we're shown repeatedly. X, as a slasher, exists in a middle limbo, between hopelessly dumb films like Friday the 13th or My Bloody Valentine and the more nuanced, restrained fare of Texas Chainsaw or Halloween. X is not ""elevated horror"" but it's not shlock either. It's a respectable, entertaining slasher, but that's all it is.The script itself is weak. The dialogue is often cliched and offers little glimpse into the characters' inner lives. They each have their own quirk, but nothing to flesh them out, to generate real empathy. Motivations are lacking too. Our protagonists' reasoning is minimal, but reasonable and varied. Some want money, others fame, and one even wants to prove respectable smut is possible. It's all believable, if not hugely compelling.Our antagonists' motivations, on the other hand, are reductive and intellectually lazy. There's little reason for them to act as they do once, and the idea that this is a recurring circumstance is laughably absurd. The fear and distrust of conservatism is another element X shares with Easy Rider; the old folks in this film are reminiscent of the two yokels who slaughter Hopper and Fonda to end that film. They're actions are just as rash, and just as unlikely.The absence of any truly relatable or compelling characters makes X's overall framework as creaky as the film's civil war era boarding room. There are no greater thematic or dramatic statements to validate the ""porno meets slasher"" concept. Many of the plot elements feel disjointed and tacked on - no greater cohesion exists. There is a repeated and murkily vague commentary about religion which is never developed and amounts to little more than a final, wildly convenient shock. The film is effective and engaging enough to make you watch, but not so effective it will make you think.The more technical elements are nice individually but greater than their sum. The cinematography is crisp and stark. It's both colorful enough to evoke the 70s mood but desaturated enough to distill some intrinsic dread. When night comes shadows rule, draped across the land and lit only by an unsettlingly realistic bluish glow.The soundtrack is interesting, though as rote as the dialogue at points and sometimes overbearing, being used to drive the suspense rather than the other way around. Again, both of these elements - in addition to the set design and sound mixing - are impressive on their own, but don't mesh as a holistic vision. X is frustratingly satisfying.The cast is small and generates nice chemistry. The performances can't salvage one-note characters but they do imbue them with energy, sex appeal, and charisma. Martin Henderson, Kid Cudi, and Brittany Snow are good as the more confident and self-assured of the group, each as ambitious or laidback as the material calls for. Owen Campbell is convincing as an obsessed cinephile trying to make a point and Mia Goth is contemplative and vulnerable.Jenny Ortega (who's busy 2022 already includes releases X, Studio 666, and Scream 5) is underutilized and her character has little to do. The elderly couple play the horror broadly, speaking, moving, and doing at a belabored pace. Stephen Ure plays Howard and I don't know who plays Pearl; the actress isn't listed in the credits and I can't find the information online. Seems like an odd, rather disrespectful oversight.X would've benefited from a more explicit or exploitative approach, especially considering the era and films it attempts to emulate; the porno scenes are oddly restrained and even respectful, and the film takes itself too seriously to have a viscerally gonzo good time between the sex and slashing. The setup and daylight sequences are the most tense and taut - the actual slashing is standard stuff. In eschewing the more exploitive elements of its premise, the film also doesn't pull off the sudden shift it aims for. The hint of gory exploits to come overpowers the daylight fun and stifles our protagonists' filmmaking ambitions.Final note, nitpicky but important. The porno within the film never feels convincing for its construction or era. The lighting within is homogenous, always bright, flat, and overly clean despite a location change. At one point, the porno is shot from within a dimly lit barn, but the results are as bright, flat, and clear as when shot from the more adequately lit bedroom. The porno also cuts within itself like an already-edited sequence. Again, these may be nitpicks but they're important nitpicks. X is a film that relies on its details for immersion, and the immersion is fractured when the details aren't realized.At the end of the day, X is a diverting film. It's suspenseful and patient, two of the most important elements of a good slasher, and the setting and premise are direct but novel. It meets expectations, even if it's also an ultimately simple, straightforward film. Its attempts at deeper religious critiques fall flat, but it does stand out in the rote and uninspired filmography of ""non-renaissance"" contemporary horror. I was entertained, but that's all I was. Once the film ends, it begins to leave the memory, mixing and mashing with all of its influences and remembered more by what could've been than what was. Fans of horror, particularly slashers, will enjoy it, but if a bloody, sexy, chilling tale of lust and violence isn't for you, then I advise you to stay away.7/10.","

It may have been mostly surrounding Mia Goth as the pseudo muse of both the fictional adult movie as well as X itself; I'm just not an all around fan of hers. Also, her playing both Maxine and Pearl was just blaaaah!X is pretty slow at getting to the good/exciting stuff and once the gore happens, it feels cheap and campy but not in a good way.This is a solid ""free"" movie. I would have probably been disappointed paying $15 to see it in theatre.Watched on the Cineplex Store (I had a free movie to use). Lucky me saw the movie move to Amazon Prime the very next day I watched it from the Cineplex Store, so that was fun 👎","

It centres on a group of people making a adult film in an old back house on a rural american farm owned and resided by a very elderly couple, without them knowing the reasons for renting the space.The rest of the ""plot"" is so minimal I cant really say more without spoiling so far to say that what I have described is the first hour, the last 40 minutes is the main story and it is just stupid, I don't mean that to attack the film, it really is a stupid plot, as in dumb and not believable, I sent the first hour thinking there must be a really good second half to this to warrant it, sadly no, it was one of those films that at the end I was genuinely angry I wasted my time on.If I had to give a positive, what little acting there was by the adult film crew and its stars, was ok, not bad at all and I think this is one of the films they will probably regret ever doing.Please do not watch this, I cannot comprehend how this achieved 7.1 (at the time of writing this) Its just so awful and I will avoid films by this director and company.","

I even nearly walked out of the movie, which I have never done before. The ways these characters die is so over the top from stepping on a nail, to getting eaten by a crocodile to getting decapitated by a truck. But the worst part about this was the twist at the end. Throughout the movie, there is a televangelist playing on a small television and we learn at the end that the man girl is his daughter, and all I thought was ""WTF"".

It really isn't- especially as it ""gets out"" to the more general public that don't have the attention span to catch everything that's going on here. Spoiler: You need to put your phone down for this one.The juxtaposition of the making of a porn film in the midst of a horror film reminds me a little of ""A Serbian Film""- which is stronger and generally much more extreme than this. We're seeing the birth of a new genre- horror/porn.This is not without it's flaws- chief among them the casting of a heavily made up young person to play an older character. You would think that after the catastrophic use of this in Suspiria 2018- we wouldn't be seeing this ever again never mind four years later. You spend three quarters of the film trying to sort out who is playing the old lady and if there's a reason for it (at least this time it actually does have meaning)-sadly, it's a distraction that's payoff isn't important enough in the end- in fact it's kind of trite.

X is a film that follows a group of youths in their prime looking for stardom through an adult film shoot in 1970s Texas. When they pay off an oblivious elderly couple in order to film using a cabin (and a barn) on their property, things aren't what they seem and their big dreams of stardom quickly become their biggest Nightmare! Every shot in this film has meaning, every character is memorable, and its overall atmosphere is eerie enough to make even the most hardcore of horror fans skin crawl. X is a film that I may be able to confidently say is the scariest horror film in 2022. While obviously I can't say this for certain until the end of the year this films sound design combined with its clearly thought out shots alone, built this tension that simply has to be experienced for one to understand what I mean! While X may not be for everyone (especially the faint hearted) if you're into disturbing straight up horror this film delivers and then some.

X," Deaths are convenient and coincidental
",videopotamus,02-Oct-22,"This movie starts out promising like an old grind house horror, but then Ti West's heavy hand soon squashes any bit of nostalgic joy out of it by forcing the movie to bow to his predetermined goal of making a prequel to it.The plot becomes a muddled mess that tosses logic out the window and not for the sake of fun or for our enjoyment, but because West was trying to do too much and looking ahead to his prequel and sequel when he should have been focusing on the movie we were watching.In movies like Texas Chainsaw, and even Friday the 13th the killer is capable and on a blood lust. But here the killer is so incapable, that without the victims basically knocking on the killer's door half-naked and saying ""hi please kill me"" everyone would have lived.And it was like the killer almost couldn't be bothered to kill. Like it was a chore. Or not even on their radar. There was no drive. No bloodlust. No nothing.There is some gore and some cringey moments, but none of it attains any new level of shock that justifies the rest of the movie's lackluster performance.I can't even say this was a case of style over substance as there is no great style on display here. Whereas in West's House of the Devil, a movie that I really enjoyed and where the aesthetics of it enhance the movie and elevate it, the same cannot be said here. X is no House of the Devil. The movie is shot very straightforward with some nods to 70's films thrown in here and there, but there is nothing immersive about the style or shots or anything that really makes you feel the vibe and pulls you in. It's just a movie that happens to be set in 1979.Overall X felt like a misfire that had the potential to be good if West had worried less about prequels and sequels for some future audience, and worried more about pleasing the current one.","

As it stands, X is a very standard ""horror"" film without real scares and without any point to it. It didn't help that the elderly couple's make-up looked like it was taken from Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD, but was meant to look realistic.More smart folks will call this a ""slow burner"", but I call it ""a bit of a snooze fest"". Better than many films out there, but not as good as it thinks it is.I read that Ti West just went ahead and shot a prequel to this, exploring the character ""Pearl"" and how she became what she is in X. Which is astonishing. How does West get the funding for his pointless films? I couldn't care less about a prequel, to be honest.

",curseofcrimsonknight,23-Oct-23,"While the premise is standard classic movie trope, the execution is much different. Slasher movies are a dime a dozen and this movie falls right in the middle. It's nothing groundbreaking and it relies heavily upon the ""making a porn"" premise way too much.Each character has their own place and they take time to give each of them some sort of defining trait but it's ultimately pointless. Foreshadowing deaths with lazy dialogue might seem clever to some but man it's really grating to anyone who has ever watched a movie before.The movie looks great and the practical effects are always better than any form of cgi. The opening shot is really cool and shows that the cinematographer knows what their doing but so many well framed shots are wasted on bad acting and a confusing plot. I don't need every killer in a movie to have the best motive in the world but I do want something. The creepiness and unsettling nature of the villains isn't enough to keep me interested.I know there is a prequel that might give us a bit more information but that doesn't help this movie. Like, give me more than an old woman who is sex deprived as a reason to kill a bunch of people. She kept saying she needed one of the girls for what seemed like a specific reason but when it came to the end she just shrugged it off. Like, why did she need a young woman to fill her sexual needs? Why was there an abused naked dude in the basement? Was it all just about sex or was there more that I missed?A few of the kills are surprising and full of gore while the others were lazy and boring. There was just an unevenness to the movie that made me feel like it was missing something. Maybe I wanted a character to root for? Horror movies have a unique place in cinema since they are usually places for superb creatively but the chances this movie takes is with giant fake silhouetted penises instead of good storytelling.","

Also, the entire premise of filming an amateur skin flick - a potentially controversial element that could open the door for exploring any number of challenging topics - is handled so gratuitously it makes you feel complicit as an audience member. Themes of time and aging are clumsily introduced, so much so that the movie almost seems to glorify youth while recoiling from even the notion of being a day over 30.There are no surprises here, no subversion of genre or tropes, and the motivations for what little ""horror"" does occur are so muddled that even after finishing the movie, you won't be sure what director Ti West was actually trying to say.","

Some few even achieved a certain level of eroticism (mostly fetish). Farmer's Daughter, an oft repeated porn title, was a good choice for this film within a film. I liked the acting by all and the photography is both predictable and striking. 'X' uses the pacing present in the genre it emulates, which to our jaded senses seems slow, but is perfect. It's plot is both predictable and new at the same time. There is a lot of talent behind this production. I recommend it for the early porn reveal and as a good slasher flick.

Goth also plays Pearl, the elderly wife of farmer Howard, who has rented one of his buildings to the group, unaware of the purpose of their visit. When Pearl spies upon the film-makers at work, sexual frustration drives the old woman to kill, with Howard joining in on the wholesale slaughter.Like every other A24 movie, Ti West's X is incredibly slow to get going, the first half of the film largely comprising of unnecessarily drawn-out scenes and self-conscious imagery-it's what cinema snobs like to call 'elevated horror' but the rest of us call boring. Thankfully, the film's porn movie plot line just about holds one's attention until the horror finally kicks in shortly after the hour mark, both Goth and Brittany Snow (as nympho blonde Bobby-Lynne) baring all for their steamy romps with stud Jackson (Kid Cudi).The latter part of the film is actually a lot of fun, director West finally delivering the violence one expects from the genre, with those who have indulged in immoral acts punished by death: there's a wonderfully gory throat slashing, eye gouging, hand smashing, and head crushing, plus a deadly encounter with a hungry 'gator. And if that doesn't disturb you, then there's always Howard and Pearl's sex scene to turn the stomach.7/10.","

",Coventry,19-Sep-22,"""X"" perhaps isn't the gritty and uncompromisingly gore slasher/exploitation-homage I hoped it would be, but nevertheless a very solid and enjoyable new horror flick, and a good return to form for writer/director Ti West. He impressively debuted with ""The Roost"" in 2005, and then continued with a handful of remarkable horror movies in a relatively short period (""The House of the Devil"", ""The Innkeepers"", ""The Sacrament""), but then surprisingly somewhat vanished for several years to do low-profile TV-work. West is now back with ""X"", which seems like a very successful move since there are already a prequel and a sequel in the making.The film starts out slow, with an overly patient and slightly too pretentious introduction of the lead characters and the setting. Everything takes place in the year 1979 (always a good excuse to avoid nowadays nuisances like social media and mobile phones), in rural Texas, where a group of aspiring filmmakers rented a farmhouse location to shoot their very own independent adult movie entitled ""The Farmer's Daughters"". They keep their work secret for the elderly couple next door, but the old folks - and particularly the wife - are not as prudish and loveable as you'd expect.The plot-twists during the second half are implausible, even borderline preposterous, but there's suspense and brutality aplenty to keep us, grindhouse/exploitation fanatics, entertained. The most pleasant surprise comes from the atypical lead characters. They seem like a bunch of annoying twenty-something jerks, but they are not. Even the most stereotypical ones (the sleazy producer, the blond bimbo, the black stud) turn out to be helpful, above-average intelligent and sympathetic people! A healthy dose of female beauty and a bit of nudity (provided by Mia Goth, Brittany Snow, and - to a lesser extent - Jenna Ortega), as well as a fitting late 70s soundtrack (including ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" and ""Bad Case of Lovin' you) also contribute to a fun viewing experience.","

",ethanbresnett,02-Apr-22,"X is a slow burn horror in the best possible way. The tension is amped up. The scene is set. All the pieces are put in place perfectly, leading to a thrilling and wild final act.The setting lends itself perfectly to a tense and unnerving tone, which is executed so well.Visually this film is terrific. It manages to cultivate a retro feel through grainy imagery, and has impressive camera work.The performances are all very solid. Its a cast of only 8 people for the most part, and they all do a fantastic job.Furthermore X never relies heavily on horror cliches. On the surface the story might not seem overly original, but when you dig deeper there's lots of brilliant and unique stuff to explore.A brilliant horror which really surprised me with its quality.","

X," A complete waste of time
",dgohmann,15-Apr-22,"This movie is a complete waste of time. Its a rip off of so many other better films and I cannot believe the rating for this movie is so high. The plot is absolutely ridiculous, the acting is atrocious, and the gore is comically bad. This is a film that wants to shock you but fails on every level save for one good gunshot scene at the very end.One of the worst movies I've seen this year.","

X," Looks hot, but fails to *ahem*...perform.
",Deathstryke,24-Apr-22,"'X' sets up all the promise of a fun, black comedy / exploitation horror that is mostly entertaining, but sabotages itself with predictable slasher tropes, hammy makeup and downright stupid plot moments.The premise is silly, but you roll with it: a bunch of amateur pornographers rent a cabin on a farm owned by an elderly couple, where they plan to shoot the film that will kickstart their careers. But we soon find out that the elderly couple have some disturbing kinks of their own...The first 50 minutes is a stylish homage to Tobe Hooper's ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', with some cool shots and editing tricks that harken back to the films of old and give everything a glossy, dreamy vibe. The tension is cranked meticulously throughout, and we know that despite all the tits and giggles, some shit is about to go down.I was having fun up until the first kill scene, which is so over the top and implausible, I almost laughed. And then it just gets stupider from there. I didn't know whether I was supposed to be laughing or flinching, but the 'scary' moments just came off as lame and ridiculous.It doesn't help that the old couple are clearly two younger actors in prosthetic makeup. There are some disturbing, gross out scenes I'll say, but nothing that made me jump, which is kind of what I expected from a film like this. The final denouement is laugh out loud funny, but again I'm not sure if it was intentional or just another dumb plot point.I gave up caring and just rode the rollercoaster to the end, but I wouldn't watch it again.","

X," A fun 70s infused slasher film with strongly defined characters and a dark twisted sense of humor.
",IonicBreezeMachine,17-Apr-22,"In Houston, Texas 1979, up and coming porn actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth), a long with fellow actors Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), Jackson Hole (Scott Mescuid), Maxine's produer boyfriend Wayne (Martin Henderson), director/cameraman RJ (Owen Campbell) and his girlfriend/sound engineer Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) embark on a road trip to rural Texas to shoot pornographic film ""The Farmer's Daughters"". Their trip takes them to a dilapidated farm owned by elderly couple Howard (Stephen Ure) and his aloof and enigmatic wife, Pearl (Mia Goth). However as time goes on the group soon find themselves terrorized and fighting for their lives.X marks the latest film from horror director TI West who's made a name for himself with solidly received films such as The House of the Devil and The Sacrament as well as segments in anthologies such as V/H/S and The ABCs of Death. West has a very gritty style evocative of the 70s era of grungy almost grindhouse type of horror films, but unlike some filmmakers who utilize that style West usually plays it very straight without winking at the camera such as when Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez indulge in that style of filmmaking. Much like how House of the Devil tackled the stylings of Satanic Horror films of the 70s and The Sacrament was West's own take on Jonestown despite being contemporary, X sees west once again return to the 70s paying homage both the Golden Age of Pornography as well as the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I'm going to say right off the bat that I LOVED X and if you're either a fan of West or love slasher horror with a healthy seasoning of twisted humor then this is the movie for you.Unlike a lot of slasher movies where the characters are often loud mouthed obnoxious stereotypes designed to make you hate them (looking at you Texas Chainsaw Massacre '22), X takes the time and effort to establish its characters and make you care about them over the course of its 100 minute runtime. The movie creates some memorable characters with Jackson's laid back 'Nam vet turned porn lead who exudes relaxed masculine charisma, Bobby-Lynne's uninhibited zest and enthusiasm, or demure ingenue Lorraine and all the characters have their own appeal and even when they aren't likable such as RJ they remain interesting. The movie takes a slow burn approach to its slasher formula with the first 50 minutes used to build a group dynamic whilst also establishing the atmosphere of this isolated farm. It's welcome to see a slasher that cares about its characters and giving them distinct identities and honestly the characters are interesting enough they alone could sustain this movie even without the horror elements.The elderly couple of Howard and Pearl are truly memorable and Mia Goth is clearly having fun in a dual role that required her to go through 10 hours of prosthetic and make up work to create Pearl. Once the movie brings the slasher elements, it does so with gusto with West bringing his typical high quality and disturbing gore-work whilst also bringing in some strange surreal moments that bring in some dark humor in a manner similar to how Tobe Hooper did in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. One sequence, a sex scene, is definitely this movie's equivalent of the ""Dinner Table scene"" from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and like that scene it balances disturbing with darkly comic to create an engaging and memorable set piece.I really loved X and if you love horror or slasher films you'll definitely want to check this out. The movie does take its time before getting to the slasher elements, but it does so with purpose so it can build memorable characters, palpable atmosphere, and threatening monsters.","

X," It doesn't add up with Perl's much more complex story
",b_velkova,21-Jun-23,"I'm so glad I watched Pearl first - my fav movie of the year so far, because after X I'm not sure I would have wanted to. It doesn't quite add up with Perl's much more complex character/story, and we learn very little about Maxine. Still, I loved some particular scenes like the one where old Pearl dresses up and tries to get her husband to bed or the one where we see the youngest wanna be star in her girl's panties saying ""Sunday"". Maxine floating in the alligator's pond like she herself is a vicious reptile is priceless. It's not enough for a movie though. Still, Maxine definitely stays on my list.","

X," Another A24 Dud.
",torrascotia,12-Oct-22,"There seems to be a concerted effort to make A24 movies ""a thing"". Of course they have a merch store where film nerds can buy something related to the current release, much of it ""limited edition"". On the face of it looks as if they are trying to create cult movies, which isn't something that can be done intentionally.X is a good example. It has many of the ingredients of a 70s/80s straight to video horror movie, but it lacks the atmosphere, fun and tension of the original video nasties. In short its pretty boring despite some ok visuals every now and then.The story is set around a low budget film crew making an adult movie on some creepy old couple'(because old age is the new horror apparently) ranch. Its basically a slasher but with pretentions of being more high brow. The kills are predictable and not very entertaining, as a result there is zero tension leading up to them.Mia Goth is probably the biggest name attached to this, she has an unusual face as she can appear beautiful sometimes but very plain at other times. I am still undecided. What I am decided on is that these A24 movies are basically hype which seem to attract people who think they have ""superior taste"" because nobody likes what it is they profess to enjoy. Edgy.What is also unclear is why they didn't cast old actors for the elderly couple, as a result they do not seem convincing. Apparently being almost 100 doesn't affect their eyesight, hearing or memory either. Nor their sex drive.Its actually quite bad taste but as long as hipsters keep buying the merch for their Instagram pics, I have no doubt A24 will keep churning this guff out. Just don't try and convince me this is decent film making or that it isn't ""old age horror"" for twentysomethings who think 35 is old.","

X," What a disastrous attempt at slasher
",La-La-Logic,08-Jun-22,"What a mess this film is. It's too bad because it has that throw back campy slasher vibe, but it soon unravels into something that will make you want to gouge your own eyes out. Be prepared to gag and cover your eyes but not because of the scares and gore, but because what turns from young people shooting a porn shifts to old people wanting to be a part of it or the stars of it or just, the person who wrote this just wanted to have everyone bang. Just yikes. Feel bad for Brittney Snow, she seems like she should get better roles than this. The story about the cult on the TV doesn't really wrap up. It's not funny enough be campy. It's not scary enough to be a slasher. Not enjoyable at all. Change the name to XC because the 90 year old geriatrics banging should come with a warning.","

X," An unintentional satire on the 70s horror genre
",Drawmort,05-Oct-22,"This slasher could be a good homage to the 70's and 80's movies of the same genre, but, in my opinion, it only falls into the category of unintentional satire.Let's look at the good things first. The production design is the first thing that jumps out at you as a great success. The direction is also good, having good sequences. Finally, there are certain details in editing that also raise the standard of the film.Now let's skin the rest of the film. The script is lousy. This movie is FULL of stupid decisions, that only exist to favor the poor show exhibited. It has a lot of Jump Scares, but they all fail, because they are announced long before. The sound editing is good, but the soundtrack is lousy, because it's never a complement that helps create a terrifying environment. It's not a scary movie, it's not a funny movie, it's not a deep movie, although it tries to be with a good theme, but it's totally out of place. Regarding the effects, it's appreciated that they wanted to stick to those of the time and stick to the practical effects, but they were horrible. The only decent thing is the elderly costumes, but they aren't convincing either. I don't understand how this movie has been one of the most popular of the year, when in reality it's boring, meaningless, without grace, without anything. I'll probably skip the prequel, because it doesn't interest me in the slightest.","

",matthewdimarino,16-Apr-22,"Well it started off good until you find out the antagonists are 100 year old geezers that enjoy killing young people. At least use actual older actors instead of using tones of makeup to make the actors look like cancer patients and then hey, let's throw in a geezer cancer patient sex scene to make the movie even more stupid (did the writers actually think that was going to be a cool scene that would add any sort of value to the movie?).It's pretty boring watching the horny old lady kill people (yes I said horny), sure it may sound original but it doesn't work at all. The main actors were a good selection and had promise with a better script. I had high expectations as you always hope a good horror movie comes along but this ain't it, and how does this crap get made?","

",reisenachjerusalem,20-Sep-22,"I watched this with my friends because we thought the premise was interesting and it's got a pretty stacked cast. What we saw was your typical straight-to-streaming horror film.It's the type of film that doesn't have the right vibe to watch together with friends but it doesn't really merit a properly focussed alone viewing either. I can't remember it enough for the jumpscares or the tension, but I do remember some good acting performances, especially from Jenna Ortega. Hers is the only character with some depth it seems but to be fair you're not exactly looking for depth in a film about porn.Overall I'd say it seems like the film had a last-minute idea but it was carried out really well, so not exactly a masterpiece. But I hope the filmmaker keeps going, you'll get there! :)","

X," A Soft-Core Slasher Thrill
",thetyvonlesure,02-Oct-22,"X is a simple, yet effective horror movie that takes a demented twist on vintage pornography. The film is centered around a group of adult filmmakers, as they spend the night at an elderly couple's cottage. The horror-thriller stars Mia Goth as Maxine/Pearl, Jenny Ortega as Lorraine, Brittany Snow as Bobby-Lynne, Kid Cudi as Jackson, Stephen Ure as Howard, Martin Henderson as Wayne, and Owen Campbell as RJ. This is the first film in TI West's ""X"" Trilogy and it serves as a sinful love letter to the slasher films of the 70s.The story is straightforward, well-paced, and engaging. The horror/slasher genre has explored many settings and themes. Everso often the genre punishes the characters for violating the ""rules"" of the game via immorality. X is no different, however the concept of morality is explored from the frame of ""immorality"" is moralitly. The protagonists and antagonists are each victims of their own desires. Sex is effectively juxtaposed to religion. The film pits both concepts at odds. As the first film in the trilogy, X presents each character in a manner that entices the viewer to want more. Depth is well-applied to each character through dialogue and nonverbal expressions. Plot points are foreshadowed with effective pay-offs. At times the simplicity hurts the film. There's not much to the story outside of what is presented. In an era of psychological horror-thrillers, this film finds itself being fairly undemanding. It's not much of a ""scary"" movie. However, despite the film not being ""scary,"" the tension building is enticing.The cast has great chemistry. Mia Goth's portrayal of both Maxine and Pearl are distinct. Each character shares motivation, however each are different. Maxine is relatively harmless and bright eyed, where as Pearl is cynical and seasoned. Each character has a different twang to their southern accents. Goth makes each character unique and special in their own rights. Brittany Snow stands out as Bobby-Lynne. Snow's delivery of a porn starlet is outlandish for her filmography, however she fits perfectly in the role. Bobby-Lynne is the base for the sexuality that the film exhumes. Kid Cudi's portrayal of Jackson is solid. Jackson is a warm character, yet masculine character that adds an air of ease to the cast. Stephen Ure, Jenny Ortega, Martin Henderson, and Owen Campbell are all good in their roles. Each character interaction is natural. The film's charm is predicated on the cast's chemistry. Whereas most slasher film throws random personalities together, X throws like-minded parties into the bog and comes out clean.The cinematography is a throw-back to 70s films. The camera zooms and encloses into characters from a wide shot, delivering a vintage experience. At times, the film mimics that of 70s pornography taking a 4:3 aspect ratio, providing an air of authenticity. Lighting is used effectively. The film is very dark at times, adding to the overall tension. The use of the color red enhances the deaths, as well as the gore within the film. Largely, the film is well-edited. Moments of tension are matched with sex scenes in a manner that successfully juxtaposes the scenes while telling one cohesive story.Overall, X is a simple, yet enjoyable slasher flick. It effectively pays homage to classic slasher thrillers, while placing its own stamp on the genre. The film is bolstered by the cast's chemistry and engaging cinematography. The use of sex and religion is thematically well crafted. TI West constructs a soft-core horror porno that leaves much to be explored.","

X," Good Slasher with More to Say
",Reviews_of_the_Dead,20-Nov-22,"This was a movie that when I learned about it, I was excited. I try to temper my expectations in cases like this to not be let down. Ti West is a writer/director who has movies that I enjoy, so that added to it. From the bit of the trailer I saw, this had my attention. Jaime and I went to see this at the Gateway Film Center during opening weekend. I've now given it a second viewing ahead of making my top horror films of 2022 list.Synopsis: in 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives.Now the synopsis is a bit off, but that is the gist of the movie. We start by seeing the aftermath of something. Sheriff Dentler (James Gaylyn) arrives and he's joined by deputies and other police officers. Whatever happened here was a bloodbath. The movie then shifts 24 hours before.We then meet Maxine (Mia Goth). She is in a dressing room and snorting cocaine. She is joined by her boyfriend, Wayne (Martin Henderson), who is also her boss. From what I'm gathering, Maxine is a stripper of sorts. She works with Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow). As the premise said, they're going off to rural Texas to make an adult film. Wayne is the executive producer. The director and cinematographer is RJ (Owen Campbell). He also wrote the screenplay. Also joining them is his girlfriend, Lorraine (Jenna Ortega), who is working as the boom microphone operator as well as his production assistant. The male star of this movie is Jackson (Kid Cudi).The movie does well in establishing that during this time in in Texas, things are hard. To save money, they're renting a boarding house from Howard (Stephen Ure). It is a long drive to get there. They are also in a deeply religious area. We get this from a gas station they stop off at where the clerk is watching a televangelist on television. This minister is Simon Prast. I should also point out that Howard watches this same preacher at home.Just a bit more background about our group, Maxine wants to be a star and will do whatever she can to get there. Bobby-Lynne understands her place and doesn't have issues using her body to get what she wants. Wayne wants to make money and I like that he even references Debbie Does Dallas as his inspiration for what he is doing. RJ wants to be a real filmmaker and he sees this as his first chance.When they arrive at the farm, they're 'greeted' by Howard. He doesn't seem to remember their agreement and he's not nice. There is an uneasy understanding between him and Wayne. It doesn't help that Wayne is a smooth talker. Howard wouldn't approve of what they're doing either. Maxine notices someone looking down at them from a window. This turns out to be Howard's wife, Pearl.Our group goes about shooting their movie, but things take a dark turn as our hosts are scarier than the group originally thought.Now that seems like enough of fleshing out the synopsis and introducing our characters a bit more. Where I want to start is that I believe this movie does a great job at its set up. Jaime and I were talking after the movie ended and I said that West is known for doing slow-burns. She didn't think this movie was slow from the start. I can agree with her there, but the horror elements don't start until I'd say past the halfway point. She pointed out though, we get the making of this adult film that keeps your interest until then. I agree there. I'd even go farther to say that dread starts the moment this group gets into the rural part of Texas. They're from Houston if memory serves. Where they go is closer to Louisiana as we are getting bayous. This movie does feel like it borrows a bit from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or even Eaten Alive. I don't mind the paying homage with the story elements. With this second watch, I noticed there are also ones to certain shots and how things are framed which I appreciate.Where I'll take this then is the social commentary here. Some people might groan at this, but it is done subtle. The major one we get is sexuality. Maxine and Bobby-Lynne both are comfortable with theirs. They don't mind getting naked or having sex with someone they don't have deeper feelings for. Wayne has even come to terms with it from life experiences. Both women have sex with Jackson on film. Maxine has an interesting backstory that doesn't necessarily add a lot, but it is an interesting reveal. Knowing this coming in makes more sense with a recurring item. Now we are juxtaposing this with Lorraine. Her nickname in the movie is 'Church Mouse'. She doesn't talk a lot. She also stares at the other women and they think she is a prude. She does surprise everyone by also wanting to be in the movie after they've gotten started. This is interesting as it upsets RJ. This becomes the catalyst for the events of the night.Sticking with the idea of sexuality, we have Pearl. She interacts with Maxine and we get some reveals to her character through pictures. I didn't understand fully until things that happen later. This elderly couple harbors secrets and I found it to be interesting. I do find some of this problematic though, just due to their age and how things play out. It doesn't ruin the movie though. This is also taking on the idea of sexuality and contrasting it to religion. It tends to make people more prudish, hence the nickname for Lorraine and things that are said by the televangelist. It makes sense for a reveal of a character for sure. Our group also knows that what they're doing is wrong in not telling Howard. Wayne is taking advantage of him. It also builds tension with worry about him finding out. To finish out this idea on secrets, it is interesting that Howard watches this preacher on television, while also doing the things that he does and covering for his wife.I don't think there is more that I need to go into with the story, so I'll take this to the acting. I thought it was good across the board. Goth is solid as our lead here. She is one that doesn't do a lot, but I'm loving that she's stuck to the horror genre for most of her young career so far. What works for her is that she is determined to be a star. There is also a past with her that worked. She just goes beyond her character as well. Ortega is good as our reserved woman in the group. I liked seeing Snow as the more sexualized lady. We do see her and Goth nude if you're interested. Kid Cudi was good as Jackson. I liked Henderson as our greasy character. I was glad to see Campbell here as he's an actor that has impressed me in everything that I've seen, this included. Ure and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.That will then take me to the effects, cinematography and soundtrack. This movie becomes a slasher film with exploitation elements. I like that the kills are implementing different tools you'd find on a farm. That adds a good element. They are also brutal. From what I could tell they were practical. If not, they hid what they were doing well which worked for me. The cinematography is great. We get some beautiful shots and I also think it is edited masterfully. There is homage here as well with some shots to Texas Chainsaw which I thought were a good touch. The soundtrack is something else that I thought works well. We get songs from the era. There is also music that ramps up the tension and the atmosphere.In conclusion, I'm glad that I saw this. We are getting an interesting period piece slasher film. There are elements that add commentary, which ticks boxes for me. The acting is good across the board. I thought the effects were as well and they go brutal. This movie looks beautiful and of the era. What they do with the soundtrack works as well. I'll be honest that I have this up there as one of my favorite West films. I thought this was good after my first viewing and that is just cemented with giving it a rewatch. One of my favorites of the year, as well as in the slasher genre in general.My Rating: 9 out of 10.","

X," Stunningly Well Made Medicority
",PyroSikTh,17-Oct-22,"I enjoyed my time with X, but I definitely feel it falls victim to mediocrity. There's so many promising flourishes in the film's brooding first and second acts, but then the third act is in too much of a rush to kill everyone off and reach the finish line. Ultimately I felt like even the little I knew about this movie was too much. Maxine was so clearly signposted as the final girl that anytime she was put in danger it lacked any kind of tension. The film's marketing doesn't make any effort to hide the fact it's a slasher, so you spend the entire movie waiting for it only to be disappointed by those elements anyway. If I had gone in blind, the unsettling atmosphere during the day would've amounted to so much more, and the sudden flux of kills would've shocked me and had me guessing right to the end.

X," A tribute that does not work
",isaacochoterena,22-Sep-22,"This movie is a tribute to the horror movies of the last century, but it doesn't quite convince me.The resemblance to certain horror films and their homage to them is visible, but I see it more as a copy of the conveniences and how predictable most of them were, I think that if this weren't an A24 film or a known director, it would be an atrocity, due to how predictable it is, and how little fear it causes. The story is written as if it were a psychological horror movie, where not much happens until the last minutes, where emotions are linked to terror, something that do not cause much terror and very boring, and this time is no exception, not much happens during the whole movie, and what happens is not scary or tense, everything becomes very predictable, and the ending seemed very absurd to me, since there was no extensive development to justify that, or even to leave clues of it's interpretation, but honestly I didn't understand it at all. The technical aspects are what save this film, the performances are phenomenal, the cinematography is good, the production design is very good and some of the visual effects are convincing.The story made me despise this film, I could never see it as a tribute, it seemed like a poorly made copy with an unexciting story and a direction that does not cause fear or transmit terror.","

X," Flawed love letter to 70s horror
",kuner-59029,14-Apr-22,"The first thing that stands out with X is it's gorgeous cinematography. This feels like a movie shot in the 70s. The costumes, makeup, even some of the accents are spot on. Several shots feel straight out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which this film obviously pays hommage to.The writing is far better than most slasher films, and the acting is quite good as well with some exceptions, most notably the kill scenes.Unfortunately for a horror movie, the death scenes in particular feel off. They hold back a lot, especially with the female characters, which is unlike 70s movies, but more importantly, the pacing and acting are off. A Friday the 13th and similar movies knew how to perfectly pace a kill scene. Here, people often stare at each other way too long before the kill, which makes the fact that the killers are frail 90 year olds stabbing and shooting young adults all the more unbelievable. For example one young male is stabbed in the neck, with the knife stuck in there, and doesn't even attempt to fight back. Such a wound would not lead to paralysis, on the contrary, the blood loss would be slow, and the reaction violent with the body full of adrenalin. Such a wound may be fatal is untreated, but it would take a long time to bleed out, and he could have most definitely fought back.Similarly with another character who is shot point blank with a shotgun, despite the murderous intent being clear, and him having ample time to wrestle the gun from the killer.The heart attack scene could have used some forshadowing and also felt weirdly off pace and badly acted to the point where I suspected it to be a ruse at first.The movie is also way too long, as low budget horror films tend to be. 20-30 minutes shaved off the runtime would make for a far better viewing. After such a long film, there's no real payoff at the end either.All that being said, the movie does get the feeling right. It's not a grindhouse style parody, but a genuine love letter to the 70s, and the few flaws can be generously overlooked. If you're looking for old school horror, X is recommended over this year's umpteenth Texas Chainsaw Massacre reboot.","

X," An unusual slasher
",parry_na,14-Oct-22,"Directed by Ti West, who was behind the very interesting 'The Innkeepers (2011)' and 'The Sacrament (2013)', this also stars Mia Goth, one of the most interesting performers around.The results form a slow-burning slasher film built on an interesting premise: set in 1979, the main cast are staying on an isolated farm to make 'The Farmer's Daughters', a film set in the burgeoning pornography industry. Apart from the in-fighting among the cast and crew, there's also the business of the disapproving owners of the farm, octogenarians Howard (Stephen Ure) and his wife Pearl.There's some interesting bi-play between them all, but then things begin to get a little ridiculous, although events are based on real killings carried out by Ray & Faye Copeland in the mid-'80s.Performances are good across the board, and the New Zealand location is put to effective use - beautiful, but remote. Strange though, even with the advancements made in effects and prosthetics, the 'old age make-up', as used here, is never very convincing.Goth is good as always in both her roles - she has long since deserved the chance to play a part that gives her something interesting to do - although the reason she is playing two roles is only superficially interesting. Or, put another way, seems to be a bit of a gimmick. My score is 6 out of 10.","

X," What a Great time - Even better 2nd time around (especially after watching Pearl)
",LennyReviewz,31-Jan-23,"2nd viewing of this. Rewatched as result of watching Pearl. I gotta say, I have a new found appreciation for this movie. I liked it the first time around, but now I really like this. (My previous score was 6/10, that score has certainly gone up now.) It was cool to catch the moments where the two movies intertwined.Pearl had lived this life for so many decades and is still going strong. (Apparently her husband also joined her in the madness at some point.) She feels like the years have passed her by. She wants to be young again and misses being touched by Howard (her husband). All the events in the film eventually brings them together, and also tears them apart.This film slowly builds up for most of the run time, which is good. For this type of film, you want that slow burn. Too much action, too quickly would be overkill.I love how all the kills come in a relatively short amount of time. It's one right after another, in a span of what felt like 15-20 minutes. All the kills were really nice. My favorite death was the one in the pond, followed by the one in the barn. Great stuff.The acting in this wasn't anything special. But then again, you don't watch something like this and expect Oscar worthy performances.I don't know how to describe it. This movie has a certain charm to it. Most of my ""review"" feels like random thoughts cause I'm at a loss for words.It's a great time, great watch, tons of fun. Watch this, especially after watching Pearl.This gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 8/10.","

X," X Goin' Give it to Ya
",solojere,23-Mar-22,"To quote the late great DNX (RIP) ""X Gonna Give it to Ya."" X is set in 1979 rural Texas where a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast finds themselves fighting for their lives. Spoiler warnings as there is a lot to break down here.X is one of the craziest films I have ever watched, but it's actually a lot deeper than your normal horror/ slasher film. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I actually left the theater blown away, not sure fully what to think about what I had just watched. Now usually, I'm not a horror fan, and to be honest, I only watched this movie because Brittany Snow is in it. I'm one of her biggest fans, and I was worried when I heard she was going to be in this and that she was going to be naked. But I have to say she totally killed it, and she steals every scene she is in. She alone makes the film worth seeing. Brittany Snow plays Bobby-Lynne, an adult film star who is setting out to mark on the world opposite Kid Cudi and Mia Goth. Kid Cudi's, Mia Goth's, and Jenna Ortega's characters are likable too, just not as much as Brittany's. However, there is more depth to Bobby-Lynne than meets the eye. She is sexy, funny, smart, and near the end, even kind-hearted. Also, the scene where she sings Landslide is simply beautiful. Her voice is so amazing, and the way it is cut with the old lady broke my heart. It literally almost made me cry. I wish we would've seen more of her character. Now there is the fact that Brittany Snow is naked in this movie. There is a lot of nudity in X, which is why it isn't for everyone and probably isn't' a movie to watch with mom and dad. But for the most part, the nudity is more artistic than it is just for the sake of nudity. And, like it or not, it is part of the plot and the film's larger themes. It was strange to see Brittany Snow, someone I consider a personal hero, naked. But as I look at it, this is a job to her and that she consented to do it. No one forced her to, and she got paid for it. Also, it didn't feel dirty or crude, and from her interviews, it sounds like they did everything they could to make her feel comfortable. Honestly, she looks amazing, and it was as tasteful as it could be (Kid Cudi is a lucky man). But like I said, that is just a small part of much greater performance. And while I don't think it is her best performance ever, it is amazing. And I love that people are finally giving her the praise I feel like she has deserved for a long time now. My only complaints would be that she should've been the main star and that she shouldn't have died. I was secretly hoping that she would end up being the hero, but they had to kill her off. If she did have to go, getting eaten by an Alligator is pretty Bad A**. However, I feel like it is kind of getting old in these movies where everyone dies except one person, and you can figure out who that person is in the first five minutes. I know that this was meant to be a throwback to the 80s slasher films, but they could've changed it up a bit.I would also almost argue that it is more grotesque than horror. Yeah, there are some scary or tense moments, but overall I felt that it was more going for shock. As far as violence goes, for the most part, there is nothing worse than your average episode of the walking dead. The only death I felt might have been a bit too much was the first one. Where it gets weird is the nudity and the old people sex stuff. On the one hand, I enjoyed that this film wasn't about two old religious people trying to punish people they deemed as sinners, which I feel has been done to death. But on the other hand, I never really got the old people's motivation. I mean, I get it that the old lady wants to feel beautiful and still has needs, and her husband can't get it up, or he'll die. So, I get her motivation, but why is he doing this? He's sad he can't get it up anymore? Also, I still don't know what they were going to do to Mia Goth. Lastly, I feel like the film became a bit cliche once they started killing off characters. I get that you need some cliches here and there, but I could see almost every death coming from a mile away. However, I will say that this film is more about its characters than the violence. Hence why I would label it grotesque.Overall I give it an 8.5 out of 10
Minus one star for Killing off Brittany's character and a half star for the character's deaths being too cliche and predictable. Bonus points for naked Brittany.It is a stunning smark, sexy, funny, and F**** up film, and if you have the stomach for it, I would highly recommend it for Brittany Snow alone.","

",Amthermandes,02-Oct-22,"The theme here is jealousy, sex, and the longing to feel wanted.An intense film about an old couple wanting to have what has been long lost, and taking it out on a group of adventurous youth looking to film a porno and make major bucks.Leave it to studio A24, they have yet to make a sub-par horror movie. It's got it all: thrills, excitement, scares, wtf scenes, violence, gore, shock value, effective directing and acting, good stuff.

The XXX star actors knows what film they are in. The story is lacking but is able to stood ground well enough. I do not get the Jenna Ortega's characters mindset of wanting suddenly to be a bigger part of things. Just does not make sense.

",ksharath1999,02-Oct-22,"X needs to be applauded for its wild script idea and its freaking implementation. Kudos to Ti West for trying something like this in this modern era. The cast have just nailed it with their performance especially Mia Goth's old women and Stephen Ure's old man can shiver your timbers with her sick performance. Brittany Snow does her adult star which is the main entertainment in the first half of the movie. Jenna Ortega's orthodox religious girl is another thing to watch out for. Violence, Blood Splatter,Nudity and Sex forms the core of the movie which makes it strictly an adult material. The eye popping style kills are the main thing to watch out for that elevates the movie to better levels. The setting and mystic BGM provides the vintage feel the movie deserved.The time the movie takes to get things going is the only con of the whole tale. Slow take in the first half may be not everyone's cup of tea.A24 delivers hell of a movie experience proving themself king of sick wild movies.Rating:68/100.","

X," I will not accept a life I don't deserve.
",Hey_Sweden,15-Oct-23,"""X"" is another solid exploitation-horror rehash from writer-director-editor Ti West; taking place in rural Texas in late '79, it follows a group of pornographers. Intending to make their own adult film, they rent a guest house from a very aged farmer (Stephen Ure) and his fragile wife Pearl. Eventually, this conservative old couple cotton on to what the youngsters are doing, and set out to punish them - I mean REALLY punish them.Shot through with ominous atmosphere almost right from the start, this actually has more on its mind than just titillation and visceral horror. Rather, it's pretty poignant when it makes the viewer think about the effects of ageing, and one can take some pity on this long-married man & wife. It also obliges the viewer to think about peoples' perceived notions of sex & sexuality.But West doesn't skimp on other aspects. His typically slow & measured pacing works well, and this does get positively creepy and twisted at times. The gore is quite effective, although there may not be enough sex & nudity for some viewers, given the nature of the film-within-the-film. West also takes the time to subvert at least one expectation.The cast gives it 100%, with Mia Goth proving to be particularly watchable in what is a dual role. Jenna Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi (also an executive producer), Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell, and Ure are all good in support. While you never believe that the actors playing Howard & Pearl are nearly as old as they're playing, they give memorably striking performances.I also enjoyed the little twist West throws in right at the end, and the soundtrack full of appropriate needle drops.Followed very soon after by the prequel ""Pearl"".Seven out of 10.","

",trashgang,09-May-22,"When i heard of Ti West putting out a new horror I immediately wanted to see it. Have seen almost all his features and i do like them. This one had the promo of Hereditary on it, a flick that was overrated for me.Luckily I didn't bother about that and watched this rather gory flick. Divided in two parts, first part is the sexy part with a lot of nudity involved normal because it's all about making a porn flick. I was surprised how far they went to make it look like a porn, the score even the echoes used and the look of cinematography took me back to the heydays when porn was a normal thing in theaters. Slowly you can see that the place they are shooting doesn't look what it should be, the owners, the heat, the emptiness surrounding the house, yes, deep south USA, it has that Texas Chainsaw Massacre atmosphere.After exactly on hour the gore comes in, and let me say, it is really one for the gorehounds. And it's even here and there an ode to the old slashers. In fact, this is a slasher.I did like this one on every part. Been a while since I enjoyed a good new horror but this one delivers. And I can understand that some reviews are very negative. But for those grown up in the early eighties as i am then you will enjoy this dark gory slasher flick.Gore 3,5/5

X," Wow just wow
",mchlbarthel,28-Apr-23,"So I had to see what all the hype was about this movie. I read the reviews from most people and it seemed as though the ratings were split. I usually don't pay attention to what others have to say about a movie because it's all a matter of opinion anyway. Certain movies have high ratings and aren't worth watching while others have low ratings and are. So I decided to give it a try and come up with my own opinion.First off, I liked the cinematography of this movie, but for me it truly lacked in story. An group of young people try to make a porno on a farmland that is owned by an older couple. Then about half way through, the old lady and her husband goes on a murderous rampage. I just sat there anticipating that there was more to it than just them, but to my dismay there wasn't.Secondly, the old lady who you later find out is none of than a woman named Pearl. She was upset that she couldn't get what she wanted, like having sex with her husband. He was afraid to do so due to his heart condition, however they ended up having sex anyways with one of the characters underneath the bed. Towards the end of the movie he ends up dying of a heart attack because of a ""jump scare""! I was like what the crap!!Then at the end of the movie there happens to be a ""Big. Reveal"" that was quite predictable. Which left me saying to myself, who really cares!! At no point in this movie did was I ever invested in any of these characters. In fact there were several times that I wanted to completely stop watching it towards the ending, but I figured that I was this far into it that I should watch the whole thing.I'm all for horror movies that don't really have a plot to it, I mean I watched Rubber which is literally about a killer tire. How much absurd of a plot can you get!! However I truly enjoyed watching Rubber, even though it was quite cheesy to say the least. X on the other hand I didn't enjoy at all and I feel like I got dumber after watching it. Don't take my opinion on this movie, watch it and make your own opinions about it. After all we have our own likes and dislikes, I just know that I am not a fan!!","

X," An elderly couple escapes from an Egyptian tomb, then...
",fedor8,14-Apr-23,"I have no idea how - once again - one of these mindless slasher films (or in this case ""hillbilly killer"" films) made it on my watch-list. Usually I root those out while searching for horror films. I have a strict ""no-thrillers - only supernatural horrors"" rule, but every once in a while I get sloppy in my detective work and one of these crappolas ends up on my screen. The bad part is that by the time I realize this, the movie is already one-third over, so then I feel obliged to finish it, which is of course a monumental waste of time with practically all thrillers... With the usual risk of (even more) brain-damage.Though with the help of the fast-forward button, naturally. I pretty much skipped/skimmed through a third of the movie, all of it in the 2nd half. Once I realized that the idiotic premise involved murderers who were an ancient couple that looked like they'd escaped an Egyptian tomb, I lost all interest. That kind of stuff is geared toward different demographics, those who welcome brain-damage with open arms. It's not for me. Any time murderers are dumb-yet-uncatchable, or little children, or ancient couples, or farm animals, I try to avoid it. I have no time for such junk. One needs barely functioning grey cells to get into that kind of malarkey, which is why the thriller genre is the most peanut-brained film genre of them all.It's not all bad though. The first half-hour has positive things about it.The photography is good: because the plot takes place in the late 70s there are actual colors i.e. This isn't a stereotypical bleak-looking 21st-century grey-o-rama piece of junk.The set-up is OK: a crew of decadent buffoons go to shoot a po$$ographic film. Better still, they don't behave like utter clowns, at least not often, and they are not the usual teen cretins, but vary in age, though the women appear to be in their twenties. There is a sense of mystery in this section, which of course turns out to be just a ruse for the movie to eventually dive into stupid-slasher mode.Speaking of diving, there's an interesting scene with Mia in the lake, early on. The aerial camera angle works very well. She resembles the young Shelley Duvall, though I doubt anyone noticed.However, the old couple is just ridiculous, total overkill. Extreme make-up was used to make them look as if they were 250 years old, literally like Bowman in the final scenes of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Not only do they look too repulsive, they also lack realism, completely. It's ""Texas Chainsaw"" 1974 all over again but with far less style and mood.The premise of a murderous old couple isn't even that original: I came across it a few years ago in an even dumber UK film, in which the young people (burglars) get owned and killed by an old couple who look like they couldn't sit through a round of bingo much less kill and mutilate. And didn't M Night Charlatan also do a thriller about old killers on a farm recently? Hating on old people AND farmers at the same time: two despised, non-hip demographics swatted with one fell swoop. Perhaps it's a new genre invented by can$el-culture millennials who hate all generations older than Xers because they aren't PC enough for them? It's not as if I hadn't noticed that old movies barely get played on cable anymore, and by that I mean anything older than the 90s, which isn't even that old to begin with...Believe me, in just a decade nearly ALL films made before the 90s will be banned by these new kids, except those that deal with gay rights and ra$ial issues in an ""acceptably ko$her"" manner. Already now it's become very rare to come across movies from the 70s and 80s, let alone from the 40s or 50s. Wasn't ""Gone With the Wind"" banned in some U. S. states because some snowy flakes deemed it ""raci$t""?Soon all history will be ""erased"", newly re-written and all ""old non-progressive cultures"" will be swept under the rug, deemed too ""offensive"" and ""vile"" for the pre-Orwellian PC plankton. Perhaps these plankton will force everyone to shave their heads too, and burn DVDs in large bonfires, and then we'll have ""1984"" right in the middle of the 21st century.So yes, this might be a new thriller sub-genre, old people being evil serial-killers, despite the fact that such a premise is too daft on so many levels. You can only do a comedy based on this, not a thriller.The old woman fondling blondes adds even more unnecessary nastiness to an already decrepit story, and the big showdown has the usual nonsense. There are some good touches in the grand finale, but the conversations between Mia Goth (the very predictable generic ""heroine""/sole-survivor) and the old hag are beyond stupid, completely unrealistic and downright bizarre. Mia actually DEBATING with the murderer is laughable. Her character actually finds the time and interest to debate her future as an actress with these killers, amidst all the bloody chaos. Ti West, clearly, just doesn't give a damn. He fits this era hence like a glove.There's even a prequel to this nonsense, which nepotist Mia actually co-wrote so you can imagine how bad it must be. Would you trust a nepotist - who actually married Shia Lebouf - to write anything halfway clever or usable? Suddenly everyone's a writer and a director. Will she publish her thesis on Bigfoot next? Will her novels be studied in schools?There is a bigger chance that Rob Zombie usurps Kubrick as best director ever than Mia writing a usable script. There is a bigger chance of Rob Zombie solving the Middle East conflict than Mia co-writing a good movie.",NA
X," Writer Hates His Mother
",docnrse,24-Mar-23,"I'll try to distill the message of this snoozer.Let's see now. A woman who was, surprise, surprise, attractive in her youth, doesn't do the world the courtesy of dying by the age of 35. She continues to age. All the other characters find this repulsive, that nasty aging thing. So the elderly woman becomes the film's monster. She's angry see? Because she can't get laid. Because only people in their early 20s are attractive. See?So now she kills young people because she's bitter. Seriously, this is the entire plot.Do people actually think this? Does everyone just find their moms & grandmothers to be repulsive? Was anyone over the age of 35 involved with this film?Tagline should be: If you hate old women and are so immature as to be scared of aging, this film will terrify you.","

X," Something different in todays (Horror) Movies - well done
",BloodyPredator2,04-Jun-22,"The Movie starts with some Nostalgia, The Young People in the Van - 70s, first thing that comes to mind is clearly Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also thanks to the Filmmakers that the song In the summertime by Mungo Jerry plays in one scene , I heard this song after watching this Movie. Even when the Movie is a bit slow at the beginning It becomes more and more dark , violent and suspenseful . The Acting was decent, I also liked the Message behind the Movie (yes there was one ) and there was also some nice gore scenes. Some People say the premise of the movie doesn't make sense and its weak ( these People probably love generic Superhero Movies) at the end the premise of the movie isn't much unimaginable as people think. For me X was better than most Blumhouse Movies, It tries something different ( even not really new) but this movie was definitely worth watching and better than most recent Horror Movies.","

X," old age and horror
",dromasca,20-Dec-22,"I love film-in-film movies. 'X' - the 2022 film from director Ti West - is a horror film set during the filming of a pornographic film in 1979. Ti West manages - in my opinion - to make a smart and surprisingly nostalgic film about the era in which the story takes place and about the low-cost cinema industry of those times, but at the same time he makes a shasher that will also satisfy the fans of this cinematographic genre. True, they have to wait until almost halfway through the film, when the action really kicks in and the blood starts flowing, but what happens from here on out will fully satisfy their expectations. Quality nostalgic film and extreme horror rarely meet and work together, but here we are dealing with one of those cases.The film has eight characters. Six of them are the members of a film team looking for a low-cost location for the filming of an adult movie and find it in an unused building on a farm in the vastness of Texas, owned by an old couple with an unsettling physiognomy and with a rather hostile behavior, which should accentuate the doubts of young people. As in most genre films, the audience is much more aware of the dangers than the protagonists. The members of the filming team - an avant-garde director looking for work at any cost, his girlfriend - a nice and shy girl, at least at first -, two actresses and a porn actor and the producer - enthusiastically launch into filming, without paying attention to the effect that their behavior has on the elderly. Indifference will cost them.Ti West faced a challenge: making a film about low-cost cinema with low-cost means, but which doesn't look low-cost. I think that he was well inspired and cinematographically succeeded in a big way. First of all, he chose his actors very well - seven actors for eight roles, because yes - there is a double role that surprises most of the viewers, I think, as it surprised me. The visuals are excellent and the dual use of high-dive footage creates remarkable effects. Alternating between screen formats, West switches cinematic styles between those practiced in 1979 and 2022. The soundtrack offers a veritable anthology of the music that any youngster knew and loved in the 70s. A word of warning, though. There will be viewers who will not like everything that can be seen on the screen in this movie. Those who avoid gory horror films will do well to avoid 'X', and so should do those who can't stand nudity or sex in movies. These didn't bother me, I consider them part of the cinematic convention. Instead I felt less comfortable with turning old age into a source of horror. I find it problematic, but maybe I should also see the 'prequel' ('Pearl') - released six months after this film, also directed by Ti West and co-written with the excellent actress Mia Goth who appears in both films - in order to have a complete perspective. Rumors go that a sequel is in making, so 'X' has a chance to become a new series of horror films, but - I hope - not an ordinary one. With all the reservations and questions raised by this movie, I will watch it.","

X," Decent slasher film!!
",dannylee-78082,20-Apr-22,"To preface this review, I haven't watched a lot of horror movies - I only know of Texas Chainsaw Massacre because I watched a shortened version of it on Youtube. And ""X"" is supposed to be a homage to that movie. I am disappointed that I couldn't fully appreciate the connection due to my lack of knowledge, but the homage was pretty obvious, even to a noob like me.""X"" to me was a 7. It felt like a well-made horror/thriller/slasher film.In the beginning, we see a bunch of young people head to a rural farmhouse (equivalent to an Airbnb of the 70s) to shoot an ""avant-garde"" pornographic video, under the leadership of a middle aged director. The names are hardly important. The movie starts with pretty good buildup with very subtle, but great foreshadowing (e.g. The black ""cock"", unloaded gun, dead cow, super religious broadcast). When the movie was half shoot, most people except one, Maxine, are slain by the elderly owners of the farmhouse.The structure of the movie was divided into two parts: pre-shooting and post-shooting. Most of the killings occur in the night after the shooting. It mostly filled the horror part pretty well. I was pretty spooked for the latter half of the film mostly because Pearl (the old lady) was just such a spooky character and the setting was really appropriate. The prosthetics on the old couple made them look very VERY old on purpose to make them more villainous. Couple jump-scares were pretty effective, but not all. I loved that the movie had an intricate dichotomy between porn and horror (though the porn part was short). Fear and sex are basically two sides of the same coin so I thought it was an interesting writing choice. Also want to add that I noticed that there were some great music and sounds that incorporated moaning sounds fittingly.There were some amazing cinematography weaved into the film. My personal favorite was the shot where Pearl gets increasingly red as the blood from her victim splashes onto the headlight of the car. Incredible shot and added dramatic effect because she was wearing a white dress. And I had no idea that this was a dual role performance by Mia Goth. Prosthetics were incredible that I completely didn't even realize it. What a phenomenal performance.Unlike typical slasher movies, we actually have moments where the audience could experience the depth of their emotion. Pearl could not let go of her past beauty and had the desire to be wanted and reaffirmed. Howard was her husband who seemingly cannot fulfill her desires because of his health. The murders actually had somewhat of a basis because a bunch of young people filming porn is a portrayal of what they want but can't have especially given the religious context, hence causing the rage. However, I do want to point out that this was their repeat offense based on the sunken car and the hung missing person and I am hearing that we will be getting a prequel as well to explain their past more.The movie actually brings an interesting topic - sex at old age. Old people still have sex but it almost feels even more taboo talking about it. Age is something that everyone has to experience and yet it feels incredibly disturbing to even observe elderly sex on screen because we are just so not used to it. Sex is a beautiful act among all ages and one should be able to accept that or I think they become monsters like Pearl and Howard, albeit less violent.All in all, ""X"" was a pleasant surprise, packed with classic slasher vibes along with interesting topic selection.","

X," Average, not scary, cringey old people makeup
",nick03070307,20-Apr-22,"A remarkably unscary, unentertaining version of the Texas chainsaw massacre. I rarely write reviews but I just have to write a review on this. How did this get an average score of 6.9? That's so high for a horror movie on IMDb. And I have watched hundreds of horror movies, I'm not a horror snob or elitist or anything. I love every kind of horror, new and old. But this was just overwhelmingly average. The bad guys (old couple) makeup was so fake and every time I looked at them pretending to be old I almost died of cringe. Just get actual old people actors rather than getting young people and give them tons of makeup to pretend to be old. It was like watching white chicks - black guys pretending to be white women, it was that obviously fake. Although at least that was the premise of white chicks.The alligator scene was pretty cool and so was the constant stabbing with the pitchfork, and the neck stabbing scene. The first 30 minutes had me intrigued and the protagonists were good throughout, especially the female lead. Just the horror element was super weak. There were no surprises other than a small but trivial surprise at the very end. It just made me nostalgic for the Texas chainsaw massacre. I might go and watch that right now!","

X," Old School Lone Star Slasher Homage. Stay Until After The End Credits For Prequel Scene!
",RightOnDaddio,19-Mar-22,"This is the best pure horror movie that I have seen released theatrically in 2022 thus far. It is the best original slasher film that I have seen in the theater since The Devil's Rejects. I liked it as much as the recent Netflix exclusive Texas Chainsaw Massacre.I grew up in rural Texas in this time period. Though I believe the filming locations here are unbelievably in New Zealand, I found the atmosphere here authentic enough.The sets, costumes, and dialogue all seemed to fit the time period. Maybe some characters should have been smoking cigarettes, but American productions seem to have determined that this is the sin of sins now, nevermind that this film is its own nuevo bloody massacre just don't light up before, during, or afterwards.It takes a while to get to the blood and guts of it all but the lead up is still enjoyable with all the aforementioned.The actresses are all beautiful, I knew that was the dude from The Ring, and Kid Cudi surprised me with his acting. He can act. I think he has a bright future in films.There is a creature introduced into the story that brings an unexpected element of non-slasher terror all its very own. The action sequences involved with this creature will surprise and delight audiences who will not be expecting this most welcome story angle. Dare I say, the scenes are even beautiful, and certainly creative, when this creature is on screen.The villains in this film are enjoyable characters. I just feel there needs to be a method to their madness. It doesn't need to be fully explained, but give us more than this is happening just cause, or because it's convenient and they are there.The duration of the film never really explains this.So, stay until the very end. Stay until the final credit has rolled by.There is almost another entire film at the end of the credits. A prequel of sorts.Stick around. You won't regret it. I feel sorry for those that all left during the showing I attended.If you like slasher films, you'll like this movie. I feel it only lacks in humor. It could have used a little bit more comedy. Funny, awkward moments or conversation, zingers, lines, something to give a movie as stylish as this some balance.","

X," Utter Trash, Don't Waste Your Time
",tfgreene-27061,15-Jan-24,"This film is absolute trash!First, it's nothing more than a mix of raunchy low grade interracial soft-core porn and cheap Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip off. There is absolutely nothing original about this movie.Second, the movie is slow moving. Holy cow, this thing drags out. The first killing doesn't even occur until halfway through the film. I'm not a gore fan, but if you are, you're going to wait a long time for the gore.Third, the movie is entirely predictable and uninteresting. As I said, the porn is raunchy, but you know it's coming (no pun intended), because this group of losers drive out of the city and into the countryside to make a porn movie. But why some Texas chainsaw massacre site for the film? They drove out of a major metropolitan area. What, there are no good settings for porn in the urban environment? I'll tell you why they drove out to the countryside: so Hollywood could (yet again) paint rural folk as inbred, disease-ridden, maladjusted psychopaths. (Yeah ... unlike the group of maladjusted psychopaths that made this film.)Fourth, every one of the main characters is despicable. I couldn't sympathize with any of these degenerate losers who left the city to bring their moral depravity to the rural environs. In fact, not only could I not sympathize with them, I hated every one of them and couldn't wait for them to die. But, back to point number two, it takes way too long for the meaningless gore of each of their deaths.Oh, and here's a bonus reason to hate it: it costars Jenna Ortega as a ""nice girl"" who didn't like porn, but after seeing it wants to star in it too. I certainly won't view Jenna's portrayal of the Wednesday Addams character with the same light-hearted comedic affection ever again.What utter garbage of a film, and with zero redeeming qualities! Don't waste your time.","

The storytelling wasn't as cut and dry, to say the least.But overall this movie is not bad since the unique way the cuts and the lighting are made, is intriguing. The acting is also great , and that's why each character is able to shine.It's safe to say that movie isn't bad, but the story is kind of slow paced and only impresses through some artistic qualities such as acting and cinematography.","

Even after seeing the trailers I had my trepidations about the movie, the setup seemed flimsy and forced and I wasn't sure how the film was going to get from point A to point B. Lo and behold, the plot is flimsy and forced. It had a very promising first act and I was starting to change my mind but after a really cheesy montage set to a not-very-good cover of ""Landslide"", the film falls apart and loses direction. No offense to Mia Goth, I'm sure she's a great actress, but Maxine is NOT final girl material. This movie is sequel baiting so painfully hard. No wonder they pumped out 2 other in-universe films already. The whole point of this movie is to set up a new franchise. I'm so sick of A24 style horror movies. I love A24 dramas but this ""intelligent horror"" wave really does not bode well for the genre of this is where it's headed. Overrated film that loses all direction after a promising start.

You know there will be nudity. So if people see it and critics and reviewers here and IMDb say that it has too many sex scenes in it, and you know that the majority of them or between a guy that looks like Jackson's character and a girl that looks like the Maxine character. And that is the case. Now if the guy looked like the old man that kissed the Jenny Ortega's character at the beginning of the movie and the critics would never describe the sex in the movie they never indicate that there was any nudity in the movie. In fact the way the critics describe it or the reviewers would describe it in that case, you think it's a romance movie or just a thriller with no nudity and no sex. So the tropes are Alive and Kicking in this movie including the killing of the Jackson character after he has sex with any girl that has the skin tone of Maxine. It is a trashy movie and bombed at the box office. The 10 Stars are for deceptive purposes only. It deserves zero Stars and less. Zeros below this post are complimentary.

X," The old and bitter versus the young and sexy
",Groverdox,30-Jul-22,"With ""X"", Ti West breathes new life into a sub-genre most people believe to have been on life support for the last several decades.Some shots harken back to perhaps the greatest slasher ever made, ""Halloween"", and the movie manages a similarly eerie, frightening atmosphere.The plot concerns a group of pornographers going to stay in an isolated farmhouse where they intend to shoot a movie called ""The Farmer's Daughters"". The farmhouse owners are an eccentric elderly couple who have some violently conflicting views about sex in general. When the old man realises what they're there for, he is haughty and indignant; when the old lady witnesses our heroine's performance, she is jealous. Perhaps they represent both sides of what motivates the censorious attitude toward pornography, simultaneous disgust and attraction - and how both feelings can motivate violence.I didn't even notice while watching that the actress who plays the final girl, Mia Goth, also plays the main bad guy, an ancient woman named Pearl. Goth had to spend ten hours in the make-up chair to look old enough; the effect is subtly unnerving, and it's not every horror movie that continues to scare you after you have watched it, and this just added to the movie's atmosphere which was now quite haunting.I had never been a Ti West fan before watching this movie. With ""X"", however, it's like he finally succeeded in what he was always trying to do: making a genre flick that is at once an homage, and an original. I'd be surprised if this isn't the best horror movie of the year.","

X," Fun little movie
",There-I-Said-it,04-Oct-22,"Old horror films got it, they kept the themes simple and had their own charm, they were fun. As the genre evolved it became more about shock and gore which loses it's impact pretty quickly (if you are into these types of movies) which is why they are so forgettable.Enter X, a modern horror film that keeps it simple. Actually, I must admit that I was surprised that it was a progressing better as a non-horror film. The story and characters (which includes a budget Matthew Mcconaughey) were interesting in the build up and there was some nice cinematography too. Unfortunately it was a bit of a let down when the horror element took over. The ""horror"" aspect, for the most part, made it become more predictable and the antagonists were quite dull.All in all it was a fun film, the way they used to be.","

X," Visually striking and intricately constructed throwback horror
",DarthVoorhees,25-Sep-22,"'X' is the kind of horror film we want to see today. It looks to the heights of the genre's past but is also highly innovative and character driven. I ended up liking a lot about it despite some of the short comings of the script. The credit must go to lead actress Mia Goth and Ti West's visual style.Horror has been a constant nostalgia trip lately. I know a major discussion point surrounding 'X' is how much of a spiritual child of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' it is. It's fitting that this movie comes out the same year as a subpar 'Texas Chainsaw' film because yes 'X' reminds me a great deal of the grind house feel. The film is painstakingly visually crafted. The lighting, set design, and especially the costumes have that backwoods filth feel. There are a few moments in the beginning and towards the end where West adds title cards and film grain reminiscent of the 70's but the movie earns it and it doesn't feel cheap or exploitive. That's really the highest compliment you can give a picture look this.Mia Goth gives one of the best recent performances in a horror film in the dual role of the homicidal Pearl and the unhinged Maxine. In fact I think her work in bringing out the subtleties really hammers home the themes that West's script kind of doesn't get. Maxine is young and wants to burn through her youth for all the sexual release and adventure she can get from it while Pearl is what Maxine could become if she had a life of repression. 'X' doesn't always find the right words to say something profound. It's more of a slasher than an elevated slasher but it is Goth that does the elevating.I'd also like to commend the ensemble. This is an extremely well cast film. We all know the complaint about horror films like this that the cast is meant solely to die. That isn't the case here. Every member of our slasher troop is likable and has something of a dramatic arc. I especially liked the juxtaposition between the motivations of Martin Henderson's Wayne and. Jenna Ortega's Lorraine. We understand the nuisances the characters have about sex. It's a movie about smut but none of the characters are shown to deserve death because of some higher morals. In a way 'X' is kind of progressive in the face of some of the uglier ways horror has looked at sexuality.So, yes I would say 'X' is a special horror film that breaths life into the slasher film and lays foundations for new life. After 'Halloween Kills', Netflix's 'Texas Chainsaw', and 'Scream' 'X' is a treat.","

X," An interesting erotic slasher
",thewalkingpuns,03-May-23,"This movie is more than a horror film. In some ways you could call it a art piece. But this movie does mikes generas together well. At one part we have your traditional horror/slasher as things dont go the way of our heros. And the other part is this erotic/thriller since the film students our here to film what is essentially a porno, but the owner does not yet know that yet. The amazing Mia Goth does a great job at portraying Maxime. One of the actors in the film they are shooting and someone you really end up rooting for. Jenna ortega is also here as one of her more early roles at the same time as she played wedensday. I think X is a great film. Would I consider it a great slasher, maybe not but it does do well with the cast and the way it is filmed and overall X becomes more than just a piece of erotica, its almost a piece of art.","

X," An iconic and unique new slasher!
",becky-92346,29-Jul-22,"X (2022) follows a group of adult filmmakers who go to shoot in rural Texas, however when the owners of where they are staying catch them in the act, things get deadlier than expected. I really enjoyed this film! It was tense and scary, with a lot of build up and a satisfying climax that answered a lot of questions!The score was eerie and off-putting, with some very effective sound design to go alongside it! Also, the soundtrack itself was iconic! I absolutely adore when a film can really set the mood purely from the audio!The cinematography was a big stand out, and it was all very reminiscent of Psycho (1960), and just 60s/70s horror in general. I loved some of the zooms, which resulted in a lot of creepy window shots! There were great parallels between certain shots and a lot of artistic cuts which made the film feel unique from other slashers. Also, the parts with the 'adult film' looked super realistic and I loved the colour palettes.To go with this, the visual and practical effects were amazing! The gore looked realistic, and the first kill was so brutal and unexpected which I loved! The make-up team really out-did themselves and it's crazy that Mia goth also played Pearl! I thought that was amazing! The make up looked brilliant and I really couldn't tell. Mia Goth's make up as Maxine was great too, and very 70s accurate, so was all the costuming!All the characters were great in their own ways and had distinct personalities, I particularly loved Lorraine's character! This was all helped by strangely funny dialogue, that was consistently engaging.Lastly, the movie is very entertaining all throughout and has a consistent sense of dread which creates mystery and an unnerving atmosphere. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, but actually has a lot to it and was very tense!","

She definitely is earning the title of scream queen! And this movie that could have just been a simple slasher flick made the horrors take a back seat to exploring the human condition.

Argylle," What are you doing to me, Matthew?
",FeastMode,02-Feb-24,"Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

Argylle," What Happened To Matthew Vaughn?
",cdjh-81125,02-Feb-24,"Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

Argylle," Lol no
",chenp-54708,31-Jan-24,"Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

",kevin_robbins,03-Feb-24,"My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

Argylle," Utterly ridiculous but fun
",actrs02,10-Feb-24,"So if you are going into this, you have to know it's gonna be a little campy. Similar to The Kingsman, there are moments of heart, action, and absolute craziness.Some of the scenes were a bit much, but overall this was a fun, and Interesting movie. Some of the scenes were overly dramatic and we're similar to Deadpool's opening scenes as well.The twists in the story were definitely different, came one after another. All of the actors were on point, and I loved the switches from Argyle to Real life. The worst part was the CGI cat. And I don't think Samuel Jackson said MFer once. I was shocked.","

Argylle," Disappointed-Cena and Henry's screen time almost matched the trailer, Trailer is better than whole movie.
",brijeshcs-18820,31-Jan-24,"This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

Argylle," Nothing is real anymore
",alex_with_a_P,31-Jan-24,"Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

Argylle," Matthew Vaughan's Spy-Action-Comedy Is Messy & Illogical
",SAMTHEBESTEST,02-Feb-24,"Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

Argylle," So much fun!!
",GregTheStopSign95,02-Feb-24,"Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

Argylle," Stupid nonsense with a five minute Henry Cavill Bond demo reel
",Chance_Boudreaux19,01-Feb-24,"Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

Argylle," Fur-tunately, this isn't a Cat-astrophe. It was Purr-fect for a movie released in February.
",iamianiman,31-Jan-24,"Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

Sam Rockwell seems to be buddies with George Clooney in real life, which is fortuitous because now when George cries about his Batman movie, Sam can relate having been a part of this disaster.Caville looked awkward, like he knew how this was going to go over, but was being paid enough to make a sincere effort.Sam L Jackson does a lazy cameo as whogivesashit, a spy that watches Lakers games and overacts.","

",cruise01,03-Feb-24,"5 out of 5 stars.Argylle is an awesome spy action comedy film that is over the top fun, cheesy, and very entertaining. Director Matthew Vaughn sets up another big spy action franchise with creative and stylish action. Of course the action may be cheesy and fun. Its why we usually go to the movies is for pure escapism.The plot is great. The plot changes direction mid way after twist after twists and best to see for yourself without reading about it. The trailer does a great job without revealing too much. It does set up a new franchise for the spy action genre.It has a great cast ensemble. Bryce Dallas Howard was wonderful in the role. Along with Sam Rockwell. Henry Caville and John Cena were great in the roles.The script and direction is filled with energy and style. The action sequences are over the top fun. It has humor. It is exciting. The soundtrack tries to make it entertaining. The visual effects are okay and can be cheesy. Its not Matthew Vaughn strong area with his films.Overall, if your looking for a blockbuster escapism. This is the film that will entertain. And has a mid credit scene that sets up the franchise for more to come.","

Argylle," An entertaining film without further pretensions.
",jp_91,15-Feb-24,"""Argylle"" is a comedy of spy movies, although it is not a masterpiece, it manages to be entertaining. The script has interesting twists and turns and is well written with the exception of some implausible and exaggerated moments. The performances are good, highlighting that of Catherine O'Hara. The cinematography is accurate without being novel in any way. The special effects are poorly done in several scenes and that detracts from the film a bit.

Argylle," Well, that was hideous. More CGI sludge. Poor Matthew Vaughn.
",Nixon_Carmichael,31-Jan-24,"And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

Argylle," The kings man??....
",GusherPop,09-Feb-24,"Elly Conway, a bestselling spy novelist, is targeted by a shadowy syndicate with nefarious intentions, along with her pet Scottish fold cat. Aidan, a disguised stranger, seems to be protecting her, but the film's generic spy movie glitz and impoverished feel make it resemble the rejected offcuts from the Kingsman series. The film's generic spy movie glitz takes place in various locations, but the special effects seem shoddy and unfinished, and the screenplay struggles to keep up with its own twists and turns. The film is the first in a threatened Argylle trilogy, but fans may not hold their breath for parts two and three. The film's colossal and cumbersome structure resembles the rejected, incoherent offcuts from the Kingsman series. ""Argylle"" is an action film directed by Matthew Vaughn, featuring Henry Cavill as Agent Argylle and Dua Lipa as LaGrange. They engage in a sultry dance before LaGrange escapes under bullets. Argylle, with the help of his team, escapes and chases LaGrange down narrow streets in a set piece ripped from James Bond. ""Argylle"" is a film that fails to balance the seriousness of the story with the frivolity of its previous acts. The film's plot is dominated by a zany character, Rockwell, who becomes a romantic lead. Howard's performance also loses force as the backstory of Elly crystallizes. The film's narrative drains, and the set piece, intended to be quirky and operatic, becomes the dreariest action scene. Vaughn's attempt to warp fight choreography into overstretched plastic is overstretched and unstable. The film had the potential to be a clever parody, but it seems to get tired of being the butt of the joke before it can deliver the punchline. The film's attempt to connect with the Kingsman franchise fails to deliver a satisfying experience. They exchange banal dialogue, with LaGrange comparing Argylle to a terrorist and Argylle to a terrorist. The characters, created by Elly Conway, are created to resemble cardboard cutouts from a dime-store spy novel. The film is set in the fifth novel in the bestselling Argylle series. Jason Fuchs' script follows Elly, a writer struggling with writer's block, as she travels to visit her mother. She meets Aidan, a believable spy, who blends into the background. The film uses POV shots from Elly's eyes and an editing trick to blend Rockwell's face with Cavill's, blending reality with fiction. The film ""Now and Then"" features major stars like Samuel L Jackson, Richard E. Grant, and DeBose in thankless roles, with flat lighting and jagged action. The film's editing is choppier, with three bombastic plays of the Beatles' ""Now and Then"" boosting the action. The use of John Lennon's voice in the film is ghoulish, despite the likely cost of the song.","

Argylle," Takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse
",MrDHWong,01-Feb-24,"""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

Argylle," A fun and entertaining couple of hours
",beepea-90999,07-Feb-24,"I really enjoyed this film and there was one moment in particular where I cried with laughter. It honestly brought me so much happiness. It's not a 'serious' film by any means but I loved the action, the twists and turns, the surprises, and let's not forget the cast. What a great cast it was. Everyone brought something different and it really worked! Matthew Vaughn is one of my favourite directors so naturally, I had to go and see this movie. I've also had Electric Energy on repeat since seeing the film and when it came on during one scene, I couldn't stop myself from dancing in my seat and was pleased to see others doing the same. Deffo recommend!","

Argylle," If You Like The Bond Films.....
",stevendbeard,03-Feb-24,"I saw Argylle, starring Bryce Dallas Howard-the Jurassic World movies, Spider_Man 3; Henry Cavill-Mission: Impossible_Fallout, the Superman movies; Sam Rockwell-Jojo Rabbit, Poltergeist_2015 and Bryan Cranston-Asteroid City, Power Rangers_2017.This is a spy thriller directed by Matthew Vaughn, who was responsible for Kick_Ass, X_Men: First Class and the Kingsman movies-to name a few. Bryce plays a famous spy novelist that wrote 4 books about her hero, Argylle. She is in the process of writing her 5th book when Sam rescues her from a train full of assassins, telling her that her books are matching real life situations and bad guys are wanting her to find out how she is doing it. Henry plays Argylle in her books and he pops up whenever Bryce needs advice on what to do in bad times. Bryan plays the head of the bad guys calling themselves, the syndicate and there are several cameos, including Samuel L. Jackson, John Cena, Catherine O'Hara and Ariana DeBose. If you like the Bond films, you should enjoy this one because it has a lot of the same elements, but a little more humor. There are plenty of plot twists, including who the Argylle from Bryce's books, played by Henry, is really based on-another actor in the movie. As the end credits start, there is a scene that has a connection with one of Matthew's previous movies-see the list above.It's rated PG-13 for strong violence and action, language and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes.I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

Argylle," Argylle: A Thrilling Blend of Spy Adventure with a Hint of Familiarity
",kayraurn,10-Feb-24,"The first potential blockbuster of the year is the work of British director Matthew Vaughn, known for his Kingsman trilogy and before that, movies like super-fine Brit-thriller Layer Cake, youthful superhero movie Kick-Ass and grown-up superhero movie X-men: First Class.Working from a script by Jason Fuchs, Argylle tells the tale of Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), a successful writer of spy novels about a certain Agent Argylle. Unfortunately, just when she is about to write the final chapter of her new book, she is suddenly hit by a severe case of writer's block.You may ask yourself: is this temporary or has she simply run out of stories to tell?But before you can come up with an answer, something strange happens and characters from her novels come to life right before her eyes. And before she knows it, Elly becomes part of her own spy universe. The central question that remains is: who is the real agent Argylle?This is basically all you need to know, because Argylle is one of those movies where you probably have the most fun the less you know about it beforehand.The cast is great, by the way, and apart from Bryce Dallas Howard, includes the likes of Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Samuel L. Jackson, Sofia Boutella, Ariana DeBose and Dua Lipa. But for the same reason I mentioned earlier I'm not gonna talk about the characters, either.The movie looks like 100 million bucks it actually cost 200 million!) and Vaughn keeps the movie on track, at least most of the time, with its lively mix of big action sequences, (un)predictable twists and turns, and comic interludes. Oh, and there is a cat too, as Elly always travels with her cat Alfie in a special cat pack. Alfie gets the chance to scratch someone's eyes out, cause, you know, cats are wild animals. (Alfie's owner in real life, by the way, is supermodel Claudia Schiffer).As I said, it's a fun ride, but I do have some nits to pick. The movie takes a while to get going and the final part of this 140 minute movie is way to drawn out.The set-up of a writer with writer's block is reminiscent of both last year's The Lost City and there are also overtones of the earlier Romancing The Stone. Early on in Argylle there is a sequence on a train that feels like a replay of the Brad Pitt movie Bullet Train. I know there are lots of movies featuring action scenes on trains, but this one feels very similar.Still, these are relatively minor problems.There is also a reveal halfway through the movie that seems lifted from well-known action classic The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996), which also included Samuel L. Jackson in its cast. Now, I'm not saying there have never reveals like that in other movies or series, but this particular one (including a change in hair style) flies way to close to the sun to be considered a creative liberty.So my conclusion is that for a movie that clearly wants to add something fresh to the 007-kind of spy genre, or at least subvert some of its most well-worn tropes, Argylle relies way too much on previous spy movies.And there is something else as well: I probably love The Beatles more than you, but the fact that the recently released Now and Then is used not once, not twice but three times almost in full to emphasize certain story elements, that obviously have to do with the mixing of past and present, is a bit much.Matthew Vaughn has indicated that he wants to blend Argylle and it's sequel, the Kingsman movies and an as yet unnamed new spy franchise into a new cinematic universe.That too feels like a bit (too) much.Note: Argylle is released this week in most parts of the world, with South-Korea, China and Japan to follow in the coming weeks.","

Argylle," Funny, Enjoyable Spy Spoof
",Danusha_Goska,04-Feb-24,"""Argyle"" is a funny, silly, spy spoof. It mocks the conventions of Bond movies. The plot is completely implausible but it all hangs together, kinda sorta. It involves, of course, international spy conspiracies and lots and lots of twists and turns in exotic locales like London and the south of France.Bryce Dallas Howard manages to play a range of personas of a very complicated character. Sam Rockwell is just adorable as a laid back, super confident, super competent spy. He's surprisingly sexy and romantic. Rockwell is not tall and he's not particularly muscular and he's not super handsome. He radiates scruffy, average guy sexiness in contrast to the tall, muscular, freakishly handsome sexiness of the divine Henry Cavill.Catherine O'Hara, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L Jackson, and John Cena are all really good as ... well, I can't tell you what they play because that would spoil the outlandish Bond-ish plot. Richard Grant and Ariana DeBose are in the movie only briefly but they are of course wonderful.""Argyle"" is violent without being bloody or gory. Anonymous hitman are killed and the body count is high, but you don't see any blood. There are martial arts fight scenes. Again, this is a spoof and the violence in these scenes is superficial, but yes, there is a lot of shooting. There's a wild shootout scene involving ice skating on a highly unexpected surface - it's not ice. I expected the skater to perform ""The Iron Lotus"" from ""Blades of Glory.""If you are in the mood for pure escapist fare that lets you turn off your brain and you just want to watch stars do their stuff and watch exotic locales and a lead couple with good romantic chemistry, ""Argyle"" might be just for you.","

Argylle," Argylle
",CinemaSerf,02-Feb-24,"""Elly Conway"" (Bryce Dallas Howard) lives in her remote lakeside home writing spy novels that are going down a storm. Her conclusion to the fifth in the series about the eponymous, ""007""-style agent perplexes her mother, though. What happens next? Well wait til book six would seem to be the obvious answer, but mom (Catherine O'Hara) insists so ""Elly"" decides to take train to visit her parents - and that's mistake number one. Onboard she encounters a rather scruffy looking chap ""Wilde"" (Sam Rockwell) who is reading one of her books. She tries to hide her identity, but when he gets to the fly-leaf then her secret is out. That's soon the least of her worries as she and travelling cat ""Alfie"" are soon caught up in something straight out of one of her books! She can't fathom why she'd conceivably be the target for any nasty people, but her new found friend soon convinces her that there is someone she has to meet - and pretty quickly she's embroiled in an whole new world of mystery, intrigue and danger! It's a bit of a slow start this film, with a slightly annoying flicking between her real life and those of her characterisations (that's where the ""Action Man"" style of the sparingly used Henry Cavill appears) but once we establish who is who and what's going on, we are straight into ""Man from U. N. C. L. E."" territory with loads of rapid-fire escapades that though hardly original, do have some fun twists and turns as we progress to a denouement that is derivative, but still quite enjoyable to watch. The initial concept is quite original and though the execution largely an amalgam of other Matthew Vaughn features, it still works quite well even if it is far too long, with Rockwell clearly having some fun here and the cat remaining largely contained in it's capsule throughout!","

",nindave-movies,07-Feb-24,"Firstly ignore the critic's, they really need to chill out sometimes.. Argylle is a fun packed, totally silly movie. Just sit back, don't have preconceptions, and enjoy what is a entertaining film. Sam Rockwell partnership with Bryce Dallas Howard works brilliantly, creating some fabulous funny moments in the film. The whole cast interact their character roles brilliantly with each other creating a comic strip world that revolves around Kingsman narrative. Yes, you could make a case to criticise too much CGI or script isn't hitting the mark, but I want to watch a film and escape the depressing state of the world, I left the cinema having had a great laugh 😃","

Argylle," ""Like watching a boat full of leaks, sink...""
",KatherineDeVere,04-Feb-24,"Taking my seat, I had my fingers crossed that director Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman,) had resurrected his career with a romping good spy story, set against a cracking soundtrack with some great actors.The opening, with a red-hot Dua Lupa and Henry Cavil was upbeat, but alas! From the sight of Cavill's haircut onwards, it was all downhill.The story introduces the pudgy best-selling spy writer, Elly Conway, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, (daughter of Director, Ron Howard). Presented both as an author and later as a special agent, Howard's performance scores low on credibility and high on irritability. Unfortunately, she doesn't have the charisma or range to carry the part, but is it all her fault?Almost from the opening we're served up the thinnest of premises, that somehow Elly's published novels are 'predictive' and so she's become a target for the secret service. Thus her 'real' life intersects with her fiction - throw in a pet cat and you have a winner, right? Wrong! (The cat-gags might be a high point, but like the film even they wear thin.)
There was a great opportunity here, to contrast the difference between Elly's romanticised fiction and the gritty reality of the spy-world. But there's the problem, by glamming Elly up, and adding in all the 'movie/fiction' spy-effects the story doesn't work. With another director and script this might have been movie gold.Henry Cavill as Elly's fictional character and foil, Agent Argylle, and the film's namesake, runs himself out of contention for any Bond films. His performance is more wooden than Pinocchio's - and like his haircut, awkward.As to the plot, it has more holes in it than cheese. Scriptwriter, Jason Fuchs asks the viewer to suspend disbelief so many times that it becomes a lesson in idiocy.Were they trying to parody the good-old super spy genre with a twist to every twist? Unfortunately, the result is just plain dumb. For example, Pudgy Elly suddenly becomes a crack shot and hyper-fit operative, even though (according the story,) she's spent the last five years sitting on her arse, eating junk food and tapping out vapid novels.The film uses dance sequences as humour, but mostly they're crudely delivered - a bit like the oil scene, where killer Elly, can suddenly ice-skate through it. (But hang on, wasn't the bit about her being an ice-skater just a memory-plant so how did she get the skills, physically speaking? Yeah, that's right, most of us can execute a quadruple axel on a whim. And...FYI oil is not ice.)
Spy, Aiden Wilde's character should be shot for the stupidity of his dialogue alone; although actor Sam Rockwell, does his best with the appalling material. One wonders what was anyone was thinking? If they were they thinking at all.Just as in Kingsman got the pace, soundtrack and acting just right, Argylle is the opposite; the music's wrong, the pace is wrong, the acting is embarrassing and the plot is woeful. This was a bit like watching a boat full of leaks, sink - no expense spared and no CGI could save it.Resisting the strong urge to leave, several times over, I sat this pointless misery out until I could bear no more. Not even veteran actors Richard E Grant, Bryan Cranston and Samuel L Jackson could save this purported 200-million-dollar howler..
Two hours and 19 minutes too long, it's not often that one resents the $35 dollars spent on a premium ticket, but if I could, I'd tap at the box office window and beg for my money back.Rating: Get a refund before you sit down.","

",Taigan,06-Feb-24,"This is one where the critics are way off base. As long as you accept that you're not supposed to take it seriously, it's a lot of fun. Yes the plot is convoluted, *that's the joke!* it's making fun of all the ridiculous betrayals and twists that pepper modern James Bond or Mission Impossible movies.Without spoiling, I'll just say that my only real complaints were where it didn't go far enough. Some things were implied I would dearly have liked to see on screen.And especially disappointing: the plot has a perfect setup to have Henry Cavill and John Cena kiss, and they just walked right past it, ignoring the opportunity.","

What an absolute terrible movie.What were the cast thinking jumping aboard this train wreck.There was a point towards the end where I found myself laughing, not because it was funny or entertaining, but because I'd sat through it and was just laughing at myself for wasting two hours of my life.It's utter garbage. Cavill is literally in it for ten minutes- it's slightly reminiscent of another film where the title lead is in the movie for an eye-blink ""Godzilla!"" He just turns up periodically, has a fight and goes back into oblivion.I'm flabbergasted that it has such a solid cast.The standout moment for me was literally the first ten mins that feature this absolute goddess in Dua Lipa, then it goes downhill faster than an Olympic skier covered in grease.I'm gonna give her 10/10 and minus 10/10 for the rest of it.

Argylle," A King's Woman Can't Be a Kingslayer
",kluseba,15-Feb-24,"Do you know the difference between the movie Argylle and the song Kingslayer by Bring Me the Horizon and Babymetal? The former is tame, predictable and appealing while the latter is experimental, energetic and challenging. Argylle tells the story of a spy novel author who is suddenly torn into genuine secret agent business upon being attacked by strangers on a train and helped by a mysterious protector who seems to know her very well. This movie mixes slapstick situation comedy with mild romance. It combines dynamic action scenes with tense thriller elements. The film tells its intriguing own story yet makes numerous connections to the King's Man franchise.Let's get the negative elements out of the way right from the start. This movie asks for a complete suspension of disbelief that goes even further than most fantasy and science-fiction movies in recent memory. That overwhelming element of constant exaggeration makes even the film's more serious scenes and tense sequences look inappropriately light-hearted and unintentionally funny. The connections with the King's Man franchise diminish the qualities of this movie and uncomfortably push it into an exhausting bigger picture. Especially the film's ending feels flawed and rushed in that regard just for the sake of promoting potential sequels.On the positive side, this quirky movie provides energetic entertainment from start to finish. The characters are complex, intriguing and profound. The acting performances are convincing with Bryce Dallas Howard excelling as multi-faceted lead actress and Samuel L. Jackson oozing with charisma in his memorable role as former secret agency deputy director. The settings of this movie are particularly appealing and transition from the snow-covered Rocky Mountains of the United States of America to the urban density of London in England and sunny vineyards in southern France. The story comes around with multiple turns and twists, some being predictable while a few being genuine surprises. Lighting, sound and special effects have been executed with an impressive budget and great care as they are best enjoyed on the big screen. The film's soundtrack finds a balanced mixture of well-known classics and a few new tunes.As you can read, Argylle has a lot more positive elements to offer than nagging downsides. Just be aware that this movie is connected to the King's Man franchise and that you should be familiar with said film series in order to enjoy this feature to the fullest. Furthermore, please understand that this movie is supposed to be the start of a trilogy and that watching this feature might make you feel obligated to view upcoming sequels as well. On its own however, Argylle finds an excellent mixture of humorous tones and serious sequences that should appeal to a wide audience from curious teenagers to seasoned genre experts. This movie thus offers wonderful entertainment for the whole family.","

Argylle," Sadly One Of The Most Disappointing Films Of 2024
",HabibieHakim123,02-Feb-24,"It's like Mission Impossible and James Bond movies with a lot of CGI, besides that Argylle also suffers from storytelling problem, it have an interesting concept but Matthew Vaughn execution was just poorly done, from the unnecessary long narration and at the end a writing problem with the film i felt there is just too much twist and weird characters decision, the thing that i most upset is how they use both Henry Cavill and John Cena, they are two of the biggest star right now and they decided to give them a role that are just so wasted, you can't put these two exciting actors in a movie that also star studded but somehow they are more interesting actor and they only in the film in total of 5 minutes in a 139 minutes of film, and i'm sorry to say that the last 30 minutes of the film i just don't really care and it does getting dumber, now i don't hate the whole thing as there is a moment of we're finally in the pretty intriguing good stuff after the first confusing half of the film which are not completely bad but not the best, and there is also about 30 minutes of actually interestingly good stuff in Argylle, performances wise overall i think Sam Rockwell carry the film as i think he was good in the film, the rest of the cast was ok, Bryce Dallas Howard i must say she was mixed, sometimes she was ok but sometimes she can be terrible, the action sequences was not the most exciting but there is one particular action sequence near the end with this very interesting visual and i quite enjoy it, i really like the soundtrack especially how they use ""Now and Then"" by The Beatles comes from Beatlemania himself, goosebumps everytime, overall Argylle was interesting in some of the concept, but mostly just poor executed in the writing and pacing, it is sadly one of the most disappointing films of 2024.","

",AvidWatcher101,02-Feb-24,"This is the kind of movie that requires suspension of disbelief and willingness to just have a bit of fun. Kind of a 2024 foray into the comedy/spy genre popular in the sixties. Think Get Smart. Henry Cavill is great, playing it straight in the role of Argylle, a character who seems to be an homage to the many bulletproof spies who went before him. Okay, the hair seemed weird at first, but once we see the doll version of Argylle, we get it. He's a sharp and precise example of heroic perfection. Of course his hair is sharp. Lol. Sam Rockwell brings the unique energy and style that make him a loveable scene stealer every time he shows up. That little Rockwell dance, yes!! I admire Bryce Dallas Howard . She did an excellent job, and yet I don't feel this role really suited her as much as others she has played. My take: Fun to watch. Lots of cool details, excellent secondary characters (Brian Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Samuel L. Jackson and Chip the cat), and an excellent soundtrack. A little ice skating sequence at the end was a bit of a shark jump, even for this genre, but overall I would recommend.","

Argylle," 😤 One of Those Watches in the Cinema, that about 1/3 of the way in, whilst watching, you think to yourself ""Why did i Come into this Thing"" 😤
",DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,02-Feb-24,"Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of Argylle.📜 🚫 Throw Everything Away. Give us Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa and John Cena in a Buddy Cop(Spy) Film with this exact Same Tone(The 1st Scene). Build a Film Around Those 3 as Super Spys Chasing The McGuffin, and Dua Lipa is always one step ahead of those 2 until they finally catch up to her.(Keep Sam Rockwell too)On to the Rest of this Actual Film.Negative Set 1 -🤹 They were Trying to do, Too Damn Much.🙁 Not a SINGLE JOKE landed. I didn't hear a Damn thing In the Audience.🤦🏻 Bryce Dallas Howard was ok at first, but then she started to do Certain Manoeuvres and Movements and at times, it just Looked Ridiculous. She's Not Thin(in this film anyway) nor Athletic, I'll just say that.On Top of that,🤷 The Reveal. Which that doesn't Work (more on that later).😾 Because of the Awful Direction of the Concept and so Many Twists, at Some Point during my Watch, I Just Didn't Care about the Film Anymore. You Can't do Too Much, there are Exceptions of Films that have Layered Plotlines (Predestination, Inception) and manage to Put things Together but if you do it wrong like here in Argylle, Interest Gets Lost and you're making the film unnecessarily Long and you're doing too damn much.Things I liked about the film -👌 The 1st Scene and Chase With Dua Lipa, Cavill & Cena.The Hong Kong Scene💐 The Different Colour Grenades Hallway Shootout Scene.🏂 The Oil Skating Scene.(Fun in both a Good and a Bad Way)💖 Sofia Boutella (Although She Barely does Anything)Neutral Note -😶 Sam Rockwell Tried his Best to come up with something, but it just wasn't Enough.Negative Set 2 - (I could of Put these Negatives in the First Set of Negatives, but just like the Film, I will Convolute the Structuring of this Review)🤦🏻 They Overcomplicated the Hell outta this thing. Even if you Go With it.😬 As Stated Above, around 1/3 into the Film, I knew, i was In Trouble with This Watch, it just wasn't working for me, but I kept going with it.🤷 So Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell were Those 2 all along? I don't care if it's explained like that, it just made the Previous Scenes with Cavill & Cena Stupid and Convoluted as Hell.🤔 Ok, let's go with it, So The Division want the Master File Right? Which that's locked Away with The Secret Keeper Right? And the Secret Keeper is Mandated that She will ONLY give the Master File to Elly Right? So why does the Division Give Damn about the File Then? The Keeper will Never Give the The File to Anyone but Elly. So Why Doesn't the Division just Execute Elly then? That Solves the Problem right there. Ok but wait............ Elly is a Double......Triple Agent, so she's really on the Divisions Side, but then Again she's really not on the the Divisions Side, even though she is on the Divisions Side but She Really Isn't.Overall, it was an absolute Shambles of a Watch.","

",mladen982,02-Feb-24,"Basically, a movie for middle aged cat ladies. Cavill was in the trailer just so they would watch the movie. I knew he will be a cameo since I watched the trailer. It was so obvious that he will be 5 min. In the movie if you actually paid attention in the trailer that he is an imaginary character, same as the singer.Only interest I had for this is to check is it everything I expect it would be and it is. Some fine actors are wasted on this generic trash. There is nothing more to be said about this movie, I just have to keep going to fill in insane number of words for something so worthless in every way imaginable. Also, early 2000s CGI because reasons.","

Argylle," Enjoyed it immensely. Watched it again.
",rcuttill,03-Feb-24,"Why so many negative reviews? Was Henry Cavill not given a big enough role? Does it have to be serious like Daniel Craig's James Bond?It was billed as a comedy and it is a comedy but also has a serious side. They are going to save the world.It starts with an author, Elly Conway(Bryce Dallas Howard), writing about a fictional character, Argylle(Henry Cavill), It turns out she's correct about what's happening in the real world. Too correct. It's interconnects with the real world of spies. Bad guys are after her to find out what she knows and good guys, including Aidan Wilde(Sam Rockwell) are trying to save her. It is brilliant on the twists and turns. Who's really a bad guy? And the music is great. It romps along to a satisfactory. It's fun.Without giving anything away it's worth going for the scene outside the armoury alone. You'll see.I enjoyed it immensely. I gave it a few days and watched it again and still enjoyed it. It's still worth a 9. I considered upgrading it to 10 out of 10 but it narrowly misses that partly because the twists are not such a surprise on the re-watch.For comparison my 9's include Casablanca, The Imitation Game, Beverly Hills Cop.The only 10s i've awarded in the last 10 years are for Joker, Top Gun: Maverick, Blade Runner, The Red Pill. Free Guy, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery and The Great Escaper.","

Argylle," This was a ton of fun
",edonngoblue-,02-Feb-24,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. I think that this movie was really a ton of fun. Was it a cinematic masterpiece? No. But it was a ball. I was on the edge of my seat, I laughed and the twists really got me.I thought the casting was great. Bryce Dallas was really great, Sam was awesome but Catherine O'Hara was a scene stealer. She was great. Some of the scenes were crazy and were so far fetched. But so we're scenes in the kingsmen. It's the style of these kind of movies.I honestly had such a great time. It was fun and entertaining. It's okay to let your guard down and just have fun with a silly movie that had some really amazing scenes (the color smoke fight/dance was incredible).Go see it. Leave expectations at the door and just have fun. It was worth it. 8.5/10.","

Argylle," Dua Lipa, Henry and John Cena were NOT in the movie!!!
",paolocr,02-Feb-24,"We have been catfished!!! The actors I wanted to watch in this movie, all had MINOR roles. Their screen time was less than 3 minutes. It was a shame! I would have loved to watch a movie with Henry, Dua and Cena and of course other actors. Instead this movie had none of them. I repeat none.The movie also felt too long. Some of the scenes looked cheap. There were scenes that were just filmed in a house, or just some room with computers, (OMG their monitors are transparent, there goes the budget). Only 2 or 3 scenes of this movie were good action movie scenes.Again I am Mad that I was tricked by the trailer. I expected different actors to be the lead in this movie. And it would have been a lot better if Dua Lipa and Henry and Cena hadn't made such a big impression in those first scenes. It is truly a shame that the movie I thought I would see doesn't exist.","

Argylle," Great fun, action packed and funny
",sjo-15,12-Feb-24,"This movie is a great ride.I have seen lots of stuffy reviews, and reviews from people who clearly just don't get it.It is supposed to be an over the top pastiche of a certain type of spy and action movie. Think Bourne, Bond, Knight and Day, Jason Statham action flicks, etc. It pulls it off very well.The action is mostly unrealistic - thats the point.The plot is totally unbelievable - thats the point.The low blood yet exceptionally high body count is unbelievable - guess what, thats the point.The stunts are amazing, next level, mostly not survivable. I'd read in a review they were unrealistic (as a criticism) - yes they are - as a positive.Its fun. Funny. Exciting. Non stop. Meandering. Twisty. High octane.Some great cameos.Dallas Bryce Howard is an unlikely action star but is great to see doing the kicks and punches etc. Sam Rockwell is very good.Theres a recurring song that works very well too - bit of a surprise.Its a 12A, but is really quite a violent one. I've seen 15's with much less violence. That probably says something deep about society becoming numb to violence and losing its core values.Its clear lot of people didn't get this movie. I say sit back, enjoy, go with it, its a rollercoaster.","

Argylle," Argylle
",henry8-3,05-Feb-24,"Bryce Dallas Howard plays a writer of super spy novels, with Henry Cavill playing her fictional spy Argylle in her mind. On board a train she bumps into a real spy played by Sam Rockwell who claims the mission he's on is driven by the books she writes seemingly predicting the future and particularly now as he seeks an unwritten last chapter of her latest book which will show how they can beat the dreaded 'The Division' lead by evil Bryan Cranston.Whilst at a push you can recognise one or two imaginative ideas in director Vaughn's intention to make a fun James Bond spoof, but most of them are just plain daft hampered by a excessively stupid fantasy story which falls apart due in the main to a chronically unfunny script including some risible 'twists' and some naff CGI. Of the many stars on show Cavill is ok as the wooden fantasy lead Argylle, Cranston looks rather uncomfortable as the villain with Jackson and Rockwell just about keeping their acting dignity in tact. Worst of all is Howard though who is wildly miscast and just cannot pull off the acting required here. Truly dreadful.","

",UniqueParticle,04-Feb-24,"Sure there's obvious flaws but it's so much fun especially in IMAX! Matthew Vaughn is a great director for Kingsman films, I absolutely love Kick-Ass, and he produced Snatch before directing anything which is gem. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell were so magnificent in this; I've been fan of Sam for a couple decades because of Charlie's Angels crazy he still has the same energy many years later. Not many might know Sam loves to dance in most his roles even in other events I love his energy so much! The action hit the spot, humor was great, music was brilliant although the writing/acting was a little off so I understand the ratings yet it's way better than most movies despite anything Argylle is awesome fun for anyone.","

Argylle," Exhausting
",statuskuo,03-Feb-24,"For those who liked that Tom Cruise/Cameron Diaz flick ""Knight & Day"" this may be up your alley.For the rest of us, ugh.The story is of a adventure writer who gets swept into espionage. It's not that, as the trailer would suggest, another ""Romancing The Stone"" rip, there is a spin. And it's not as cool as you want it to be.For one thing, painfully mis-casted Bryce Dallas Howard has the sweet nebbish writer down, but as an action heroine? Not even close. Let's address the elephant in the room. She is post-baby. And it shows in every facet of her moves. She is suppose to be sleek like a razor. Instead, she is lumbering and...well...pregnant-ish. So that made it awkward.The 2nd thing is casting Sam Rockwell as an action hero.No. Just no. His line deliveries seem to spill out better, say, through someone like Tom Cruise, but somehow his readings seem forced. Their chemistry is painful to watch. It was almost like watching a man at a wedding who when you find out who his wife is, you are confused as they seem to not have any...air of closeness. They are clearly going through motions.Lastly, the concept. On paper it sounds like it should work. Twists and turns and who can you trust and amnesia and on and on... I can tell the execs were probably salivating that it is too ""unique"" of a story not to commit to screen. In this case, it just didn't have the right tone. It felt sad.And yet, the talent involved says it should work. But it doesn't. And it's frustrating to try to piece together what went wrong.In truth, the misstep was probably going in with heart and leaving with logistical problems.Stay tuned for a pre-credit sequence to a moment no one can understand. It ties in with ""The Kingsman"" series. For some reason. Eye roll.","

",crankyerma1984,04-Feb-24,"The film was pretty damned silly but still entertaining for the first two-thirds but it all went to crap in the third act. Sam was great in his role. He's always good and did not disappoint here. His performance was the clear bright spot in the film. A few things: too many POV eye-shutting bits when the lead goes to sleep. Too many twists. It got deeply tiresome. And for the love of God, the dance nonsense (especially involving nerve gas). The fight sequences in the third act, starting with the gas stuff, just ruined it. After that, the film was over. They should have shelved it. The third act should have kept it from being produced.","

Ummm who cares. The trailer made it look fun. Based off of that It didn't disappoint. The story has twists, action was good and hilarious at times. So funny the audience laughed out loud, like really loud a lot. It's a popcorn movie. No politics, no real life drama just pure fun. To go off of the critics, yes any actor could have played any of the Characters. However Sam Rockwell was freaking hilarious in this role. It is fun and If you go to the movies to escape from reality then this movie is for you.","

Argylle," Doesn't have an original bone in its body
",jtindahouse,03-Feb-24,"What a bizarre movie this was. It never managed to settle on what it wanted to be. It was about 5 movies in one and none of them were good. The resulting product was an overly long slog-fest for the audience to grind through.The movie has an absolutely ridiculous plot, which would (could?) be fine if it bought into that, but instead it keeps trying to take itself extremely seriously. Often times it feels more like an 'Austin Powers' movie, yet a moment later they will try and have a heart-felt scene and expect you to buy it.The movie has an all-star cast but none of them feel right for the role they are in. Bryce Dallas Howard couldn't have been a worse choice for the lead role. She is so flat and uninteresting and has no levels in her performance. Bryan Cranston is far too good of an actor to be doing over-the-top villains in ridiculous spy movies. He does everything he can to elevate the movie but he is fighting a losing battle.The humour in the movie never lands. I was in a reasonably full theatre and I can't remember the audience laughing once. It's the kind of humour where you are more likely to groan than smile. Also the amount of cliches the movie possesses are huge. The movie doesn't have an original bone in its body.Lastly, the movie is long - and it feels every minute of it. It's one of those safe films where you know exactly how everything is going to wrap up anyway, so the final 50 minutes where it is grinding towards the finish are particularly punishing. This was not a fun movie viewing experience. 4/10.","

Argylle," An Absolutely Ridiculous Yet Fun Experience
",liammarklh,07-Feb-24,"I am not familiar with the Kingsman movie franchise, so I have no idea of Vaughn's work prior to seeing this movie and honestly, I'm kind of glad I went into this with an open mind because I really enjoyed this movie a lot.The movie itself is your typical spy action flick premise of ""agents go rogue when they find out their organization is hiding something and are corrupt and are chased down as they dodge bullets."" However, this film subverts that premise, and they did a good job of not giving away anything in the trailers and yet it still managed to hook me in from beginning to end.My only gripes with this movie is that it is way too long and should have been cut down to about under two hours. It started off very hectic, setting up the plot and characters, but towards the end of the story it starts to drag with unnecessary scenes, random slow-motion shots and long-winded dialogue that could have been excluded from the film and it would have been a snappy edit. If you don't like exposition, then this movie is probably not for you as it tends to do that a few times throughout.Though the premise is basic and the pacing is frantic at best and sluggish at worst, this movie is only saved by the ensemble cast of characters played by their respective actors who carried this movie really well. This is the kind of movie where you need to have A-listers in order to bring the story together and they did a good job there. I really enjoyed Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara's performances a lot and kudos to Samuel L. Jackson as well. Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was a bit shaky at first, but I warmed up to her character along the way.I'm not mad that Henry Cavill, John Cena or Dua Lipa weren't in the film as much, but they served their purpose well enough, and I can let it slide.By far my favorite thing about the movie in the beginning are the cuts between the real scenes and the edits made to the book that alter the story and watching these spies and the evil agency figure things out in real time, it was my favorite part.I will say I did not expect the twist that Elly Conway as actually a secret spy herself who was brainwashed into believing she was the daughter of the bad guys, that was a good twist and there were a few twists that did catch me off guard.I also really love the comedy and action scenes in this movie, that's where it shines the brightest. You can tell that these two facets are the director's and writer's strongest skills because I laughed a few times throughout and the action scenes were very imaginative and well done, though some of them were a bit hard to see, it embraced how wacky and ridiculous it was and I loved it. The movie feels like a love letter almost to spy flicks and I think it did it's job well.I recommend this movie to people who love the Kingsman franchise, those who love spy flicks, cute cats, wacky campy action and comedy and finally just a good time where you can turn your brain off and not think.","

Argylle," Written
",kosmasp,05-Feb-24,"You certainly can't put Baby in the corner - so no pun intended. The movie is filled with references to other stuff - and not just from the spy genre (if you feel that is a (sub)genre to begin with of course). That all being said and while this is quite out there (or far out?), the movie is also a bit predictable. I do think you can see many of the ""twists"" coming.Not necessarily the big ones (character reveals or rather backstories or what have you), but still quite a lot of the other ones. That does not take anything away from the fun you can have. And while Bullet Train is a far funnier ... well ride (sorry, not sorry), there does not have to be only one. Especially with a train scene that is really great and a quite ... well colorful scene towards the end.Then you have quite the stellar cast and a few callbacks that some viewers will cherish a lot more than others I assume. The movie may be a bit too long and the ""connecting"" add on scene during the credits feels out of place too .. or maybe you'll be really excited about it.","

Argylle," It's terrible, so just turn your brain off
",DanLawson146,07-Feb-24,"POSITIVES:1) Up until the ""real agent Argylle"" twist, I actually thought the film was a fun time. The plot ticks along quite nicely and the first major twist, that Elly's parents aren't real, was actually a good twist
2) In amongst a sea of terrible acting and dialogue, I actually thought Sam Rockwell was great. He pulls off the action scenes really well, he's funny, and in the second half of the film when he has to play someone grappling with the love of his life not remembering him, I felt he was very believable. In fact, him and Bryce Dallas Howard had great chemistry and the emotional scene in the car driving to France was actually quite emotionally engaging
3) Nobody does fight scenes with pop songs in the background quite like Mathew Vaughn. It's basically his signature at this point and there are some fun fight scenes hereNEGATIVES:1) For a film with a $200M budget, it felt so badly made. The direction, visuals, sound etc were all painfully bad. I can't believe all these A list actors were able to make it through how bad the writing is, although the insane amount of money Apple spent on this film probably helped
2) You can get away with 1 or 2 twists in a film, but the second half of this film has 6 or 7 twists and it made me roll my eyes so much. It's not clever, it's just exhausting
3) The film is ridiculously long. I swear on my life, when I thought the film was approaching its final act I checked my watch and we were only an hour in, out of a 2hour 20minute movie. It overstays its welcome so much and it was then outrageous to give us one of the worst credits scenes I have ever seen. They clearly thought this was going to be a hit by teasing a sequel but after the terrible reviews and terrible box office I can guarantee that sequel will never get made.","

Argylle," What did I just watch...
",sinscopefilms,11-Feb-24,"The First Impression:The film kicks off on a confusing note, leaving me scratching my head. Yet, as we dive deeper, the cinematography shines through. The transition from medium shots to drone footage, paired with the protagonist's POV shots, actor's medium-long shots, offers a captivating glimpse into her world.The Positive:Right off the bat, the funky music in ""Argyle"" caught my attention. The musical soundtrack, with its ability to build tension at times, stands out as the film's strongest feature. It has this vibe that just hooks you in. The soundtrack fits well with the film's overall vibe, although it doesn't introduce any innovative elements. Moreover, The editing is sharp and on point, and the sound design is well-mixed.The Negative:When it comes to the narrative and visual storytelling, ""Argyle"" hits a rough patch. The potential is there, but the execution feels super average, hampered further by some notably faulty acting. At times, the film's scenes were so bizarrely executed that they left me in stitches, not sure whether to be amused or bemused.However, when it comes to clothing design, things get a bit mixed. Dua Lipa's outfit? Spot-on and stylish. However, not all that glitters is gold. The costume design for the rest of the Argylle characters felt underwhelming for a spy film, too modest to match the genre's flair. I rate it as 2 out of 10.The Mixed:The locations and production design were pleasing but nothing extraordinary. And then there's the cat - cute, but the CGI moments felt disturbing and inconsistent, pulling me out of the experience.The car chase scene, heavy on CGI and bordering on the absurd, had me wondering if I'd accidentally wandered into a parody / comedy rather than a spy thriller. And speaking of parodies, the film's tone is all over the place. Initially, it feels like a non-serious, laugh-out-loud spy parody. But then, the second half takes a sharp turn into a more serious exploration of Ellie's past, which, surprisingly, turned out to be somewhat watchable.Despite these rollercoaster highs and lows, the film drags on for too long, testing my patience to the point of almost giving up on it. The use of color and black-and-white scenes, however, was a clever touch, seamlessly woven into the film's fabric.The Conclusion:In conclusion, ""Argyle"" is a mixed bag. Its unique style and moments of unexpected humor might make it a guilty pleasure for some. Yet, overall, it's a tasteless affair that left me disappointed. My verdict? A middling 5 out of 10.","

Argylle," One of the worst thing it can happen to you
",dobridin,02-Feb-24,"The movie is mediocre for the best part. But the last 30-40 minutes are nightmare. I think that the scenario was written down in an addiction clinic after a dealer broke in. Honestly I would give it less then one star if possible. When you look at the cast you cannot suggest the mockery that is about to follow. Also the entire movie is filmed on a green screen and the CGI was so bad it would be a shame for any average youtuber. I thought that the computer effects really went a long way in the past years but with this is like they have used a technology from the 90ties. The only explanation would be that they blow most of the budget for the cast and only had 20 bucks for everything else.

Bryce Dallas Howard shines with her trademark charm and natural talent, making every scene a joy to watch. John Cena and Henry Cavill seem to be having a blast in their roles (as limited as they maybe), bringing a contagious energy to the screen.While Argylle might not be a groundbreaking Scorsese masterpiece, it's not trying to be. Instead, it opts for a lighthearted approach, offering a refreshing break from the serious cinematic norm that is prevalent at this time. The film delivers on its promises of action and comedy, creating an entertaining ride that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Argylle," A hoot of a movie. A fun, entertaining, escapist, clever, unpredictable, goofy spoof of the spy movie genre with a superb cast.
",moviedays1,11-Feb-24,"Truly don't understand all the low scores, unless those negative critiques were written by people who went to see this movie expecting something like Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy', didn't watch the trailer and clearly don't get this laugh out loud parody genre. Seems like some reviewers either missed the point completely or are bloating their egos by taking themselves way too seriously, sadly canning what is meant to be a silly, tongue firmly in cheek and totally over the top, twisty-turny, wild ride. The cast is wonderful - Sam Rockwell rocks as usual, with Bryce Dallas Howard, Catherine O Hara, Bryan Cranston, Dua Lipa, Samuel L Jackson embracing the spoof genre, making this fast and furious treat such a fun ride. Throw in some stunning locations, great dance scenes, over the top action, an adorable cat, and you have a much needed break from reality.We need that more than ever and surely its possible to embrace and appreciate a movie like for what it is, as, whilst simultaneously admiring masterpieces such as Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Empire of Light and The Holdovers ( my favourites from the last year or so).

Argylle," Dumb fun
",parksiet,03-Feb-24,"When it comes to Argylle, I'm of two minds on the movie. For most of the movie, I couldn't tell if was plainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time... or just dumb fun. My verdict?Argylle is a very (VERY) goofy, but undoubtedly fun film. What can I say? It's dumb... but I kinda liked it. It's a celebration and send-up of the spy genre, but taking things to over-the-top extremes - it's excess is its biggest asset and also its biggest liability. As a certified Kingsman fan, I had some hope for Argylle. Was it fun at times? Sure. Was it also convoluted and sluggish? Absolutely. It lacked the charm of your usual Vaughn film - frankly, everything I loved about Vaughn's style seemed to either be missing or just feel lifeless and hollow here. For instance, the action LOOKS like what we have come to expect from Vaughn, but has none of the stakes, intensity, or emotion. Instead, we get a tonal mess where I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to take the movie seriously or not. It just felt like a lot of wasted talent at times. Argylle is fascinating because it's a decent movie wearing about four other movies worth of baggage. There's a super fun energetic scene followed by a huge lull, a great twist followed by a long exposition, etc. It felt both overproduced and undercooked at the same time. Wildly uneven, much too long, but still enjoyable enough. It worked for me despite not being fantastic. It fits in alongside forgettable streaming films like Red Notice, Ghosted, and The Gray Man (even down to its bland visuals)... but this is certainly the most entertaining of the bunch, at least for me! Basically - if you liked the trailer, you should have fun. If you thought it looked too goofy, you'll think the movie is too goofy. For most, as much as I love the theatrical experience, this movie will work better once on streaming. Unfortunately, it really is what you'd expect from a Matthew Vaughn streaming movie.To end on a positive note, I know this is technically a ""bad"" movie. But I liked it to some extent. So here is my unapologetic final thoughts on Argylle:Argylle is a film that's both dumb and smart at the same time. It's pure silly spy shenanigans but also has some deceptively smart subtext about the writers-process. It's vibrant, playful, humorous, sexy, and ridiculously entertaining. It is a super fun, slick, subversive action romp. Never taking itself seriously, its fantastic cast absolutely let loose. (LOVED Sam Rockwell!) There are so many twists and turns, most of which are somewhat predictable, but still managed to be fun. I just wish the reveal of who the real agent Argylle is wasn't spoiled for me by a 3-year-old tweet announcing the production of the movie!So did I like it? Yes. Did I think it was terrible and really dumb at times? Also yes.Sorry... guess I'm not much help for this one!Oh, also, can Matthew Vaughn PLEASE make Kingsman 3 already??","

Argylle," This ain't it, chief
",isaacsundaralingam,02-Feb-24,"There was just the one reason for me to want to check this movie out, and that was director Matthew Vaughn. Having made Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and the Kingsman movies, an espionage action-comedy like ""Argylle"" definitely seemed promising. Unfortunately, whatever the hell this was surely wasn't that.It's a boringly nonsensical movie with an entirely uninteresting premise. It's 149 minutes long and feels much longer. Here, we follow Bryce Dallas Howard, unfittingly cast as Elly Conway, the writer of an espionage novel series called ""Argylle,"" whose life is put at risk after the plot of her books starts unfolding in real life. To the rescue is the movie's only saving grace, the blubberingly charismatic Sam Rockwell as agent Aiden, the spy protecting Elly from the threats of her newfound enemies.""Argylle"" is thoroughly disappointing with its uncaring approach to storytelling and its nonsensical plot with some of the cheesiest twists one could come up with. It has one visually spectacular action sequence and almost nothing else to offer. I have no idea how on earth Matthew Vaughn managed to fumble a movie that was so up his alley to the extent he did.","

Argylle," A semi-satirical send-up of spy flicks that literally winks at the camera
",cricketbat,01-Feb-24,"Is Argylle completely ridiculous? Yes. But is it a lot of fun? Also, yes. This semi-satirical send-up of spy flicks brings together an ensemble cast to continuously (and literally) wink at the camera to let you know that it knows what it is. And behind the bombardment of high-energy action sequences is an engaging story that continually keeps you guessing. However, the film features so many twists and turns that it may cause motion sickness. Also, despite the large budget, some of the visual effects are distractingly cartoonish. Nevertheless, I wouldn't mind seeing another installment of Argylle.","

Argylle," Bad film in every box
",horacioreyes,04-Feb-24,"I never go so low in a mark to a film. It was really bad; I felt I lost my time. I did not put cero because of the initial scene, in which Dua Lipa is gorgeous, and because I didn´t get out of the venue.The story has so many twists that it ""crunch it"". It was hard to follow it.The cast has several good actors, but they are wasted:
Every single character was exaggerated and faker than Barbie´s world!! I didn´t like anyone, not even Garfield. Everything was ridiculous.I was expecting a much better film! That is why I am so mad and disappointed.I recommend to avoid wasting your time. Do not watch it!","

",saimariejohnson,04-Feb-24,"Argylle is witty, comical and action-packed. It has all kinds of twists and unexpected turns that keep it constantly entertaining and just when you think you've figured out the plot - it shifts to somewhere else and makes it the perfect espionage rom-com adventure in the style of some new favorites like The Lost City and Freelance.Bryce Dallas Howard is beautiful, captivating and mesmerizing and did a fabulous job in her role as it progressed to display her many capabilities as an actor and made it such an enjoyable film. The additions of people like Catherine O'Hara, John Cena and Henry Cavill offer a cast that are incredibly delightful to watch and the story is romantic, thrilling and hilarious providing the perfect cinematic ride just before Valentine's Day.If you are looking for a film that caters to action and adventure lovers along with a little romance sprinkled in Argylle will appease both.","

I may confirm that I walked out before any of these scenes people are talking about.I watched less than an hour just to give it a chance. However I was ready to walk out after the first scene. It really doesn't get better. In the matter of fact, it only gets worse.Passion was missing, bad humor, cheap CGI... I could go on and on.

Argylle," Somehow missed, not sure why but my guesses
",KatieDuncan44,05-Feb-24,"This movie was two hours long and twenty minutes?Somehow that's not enough time to explain the movie.1) What the main characters' life was like, what her family and friends were like. Just her life, home, an atmosphere to absorb, etc. I think this movie would have done better and meant much more if we had a more intimate setup to relate to and care about and understand the main character.2) Then, this movie wasn't an obvious comedy to me. But, I think it was going for a campy, silly feel of sorts in a round about way. Some like the humor and fun. I think there is a time and place for that. I believe this movie would have done better if it was more emotionally gripping and serious after introducing the main character's like in more intimate detail. Which they didn't do. This character's life could have been fuel for a more sentimental, serious and emotional movie. I think it would have worked better.3) The plot wasn't very clear until way far into the movie. It was just kind of a lot happening and not really understanding why or vaguely understanding why that was. It made the movie less interesting and kind of weird to watch. A better build up or explanation of the plot would have helped earlier on. It's like watching a game without knowing who is playing. It makes it less interesting. Many fight scenes for some vague unknown reason.I think the plot premise and characters offers a very interesting set up for a movie. This movie had a lot of potential.The scenes even. Different rooms, different villains, different environments, etc. They were cool looking and had potential. But, it was too shallow without depth so it didn't develop any layers to make the cool looking scenes more impactful.There were almost touching or cool moments between main characters but without the proper buildup or development to it, the mark was missed.I believe this movie would make a very good book, something that has time to give the emotional buildup and background to it.There maybe just wasn't time in this movie for it. Maybe this movie would have been better as three movies. A movie with two sequels. And I say it would have hit better as a serious and emotional movie. But, I can think of Adam Sandler's movie Fifty First Dates that had the emotional depth and the humor. Maybe they could have gotten the people who wrote that movie to balance emotions that are serious and humor.","

Argylle," Way over the top, but thoroughly entertaining with Sam Rockwell stealing the show
",attilalengyel-78684,06-Feb-24,"Sam Rockwell just does what he usually does: outplays everyone around him in any movie he is in. This one is not an exception. Although the project is headed by Henry Cavill, he is just a footnote after all. The real stars are the man forementioned, and Bryce Dallas Howard (who is not in her best form, if you know what I mean). The story is fine for readers and fantasy lovers, but way far-fetched for viewers accustomed to reality. But, hey! Who cares? IMO, it is a project aiming to brake us away from our everyday bad and forget all of that for two hours. It is silly, no brain cells needed. Just have fun and enjoy the ride.","

",mrglenngrant,04-Feb-24,"First off .... I had no idea that that was Dua Lipa in the opening scene!I didn't realise that this would be linked to the Kingsman universe at all but with Matthew Vaughn as director it comes as no surprise, i suppose. It's only at the end that the tie-in appears briefly but it opens the door for future cross-overs, I think.The action is absolutely bonkers. Laugh out loud ridiculous at times ... but in the bestest way possible. It's just crazy.BDH is an odd choice for the author / ex-highly trained spy. She's great but , how do I put this without offending anyone, she's a bit ... let's say ... heavy.Sam Rockwell is enormously great fun. I love him in everything and he's clearly having an absolute blast in this film. Loved Archie the cat as well. :)I do think it was stretched a bit long. I kept thinking it was climaxing but then they'd tack on another outrageous twist or reveal and we'd carry on from there.The story itself is initially utterly stupid ... but then it's saved by the reveal that she's just writing about her past experience. Very cleverly done but up until that point it seems just daft that this author is predicting everything in great detail.The end is confusing when Henry Cavill appears with long hair suggesting that he can answer some questions. Not sure what that's all about. Overall just great fun though!86/100.","

",carlschottphd,03-Feb-24,"This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I was tempted to walk as some other did, but always hope something worthwhile will happen. This was almost three hours of relentless moronic silliness. I feel sorry for most of the cast but then again I'm sure this was a money grab for all of them. They've all made the rounds of morning and evening talk shows. I actually feel sorry for the well publicized cat who has had a lot of visibility on the tv commercials for this travesty.

But even he couldnt lift this movie up beyond the mediocre level of quality it is suffering from.The bad: it's NOT funny. It's NOT thrilling. It's not original or weird in an interesting way. It's just going through the motions.It's a box office FLOP all right and for good reason.

The story is basic, but with many twists, as you might expect from a ""spy"" movie, if that is what this is.Regardless of what you hear or think about this movie, there are at least 2, if not 4-5 very well executed scenes that you really shouldn't miss. You will know them when you see them.Actors are good, its especially fun to see Samuel L in a classic cameo where he actually spends most of his time watching basketball on TV, weird I know.Go see at the movies, the above scenes mentioned are done justice on the big screen.","

I enjoyed this film from beginning to end. I wouldn't call it anything stellar, but I had a good time with it. The story is a bit messy and there's just one twist too many, but the action, acting, and script are enough to make up for it. Cavill's part is minor, probably to the disappointment of most and Bryce Dallas Howard, in the lead, ranged from engaging to cringe-inducing (namely when we see the shift in personality come along), but everyone besides is rock solid. Sam Rockwell in particular is worth watching alone as he brings nothing but fun and energy. Bryan Cranston hams it up as the main villain, doing what he does best, while Sam Jackson and Catherine O'Hare are delightful in the limited time they show up.The action and comedy are also solid, with some minor quibbles about use of CGI. It's a consistently better film than can typically be expected for January usually being a movie dump month and I feel like this will be a crowd pleaser once they see it. Don't be off put by terrible reviews. I am sure there are those who will find it terrible. I'm baffled by how people are considering this so completely abysmal, but I found it to be anything but.

The Austin Powers MoviesI mention this because obviously Matthew Vaughn was watching a lot to these movies throughout the pandemic. And I applaud parents sharing and discussing these movies with their children. He wanted to make a movie that he could watch with his kids. So if you walk into this movie with a serious attitude, then you have lost the plot. As a person with ADHD, I never checked my watch. The movie kept my attention effortlessly, and that doesn't happen often.As far as the mid-credit scene, if you read the first 1/4 of the book then you will get Cavill part at the end and you will get the mid-credit scene.

I should have stayed home and watched Miami Connection. That's how bad this movie is.","

Loved the plot twists.Who ever is looking for a deep meaning, Nobel price winning acting or even realistic action scenes, will be highly disappointed.This is a pure fun fun fun film.I loughed so much, my adrenaline spiked along with the action, and the soundtrack was music to my ears.Went with husband and 2 teenager girls, and we all just loved it.I fell in love with the characters, good and bad, you can tell they all enjoyed making this film.I loved it when in the main female role there was an actual woman, not a 2 dimensional model. She wad not thin at all, and she is beautiful! Astonishing!","

Argylle," Waste of time
",jhgqpqq,04-Feb-24,"Zero connection to any aspect of the film. Waste of time. Humor is off. Acting is cheesy. Way too many lame plot twist. Great cast who have all had individual great films however this collection is an epic fail. Samuel L Jackson does better in Capital One credit card commercials. Terrible action scenes. The film in question struggles on multiple fronts, from its disjointed narrative to its lackluster character development. The plot feels like a patchwork of clichés, with predictable twists that fail to engage the audience. The storyline meanders without a clear direction, leaving viewers perplexed rather than intrigued.One of the major pitfalls lies in the characterization. The characters seem one-dimensional, lacking depth and complexity. The dialogue feels forced, with exchanges that often come across as unnatural or contrived. It's challenging for the audience to connect with the protagonists when their actions and motivations remain ambiguous or inconsistent throughout the film.Moreover, the film's pacing issues contribute to its overall sense of dissatisfaction. Scenes linger unnecessarily, dragging out the runtime without adding substance. Conversely, crucial moments are rushed, leaving viewers feeling disoriented and disconnected from the unfolding events. This erratic pacing disrupts the flow of the narrative, making it difficult for the audience to become emotionally invested in the story.The cinematography and visual effects, too, fall short of expectations. Poorly executed CGI and lackluster cinematography contribute to a visual experience that fails to captivate. Scenes intended to be visually stunning or climactic end up feeling lackluster and underwhelming, undermining the potential impact of key moments.The film's soundtrack, while forgettable, further highlights the overall lack of cohesion.","

",fdsafdsafd,04-Feb-24,"If you like cliche you will love this. Same character cool as a cucumber no matter what is happening, same ole glorification of guns and violence for no reason. Same dull predictable plot twist and characters you have seen done better elsewhere. Obligatory DEI messaging from hwood of course now an industry standard. My suggestion, stop casting people based on who they and cast them based on what they can do with a role. But we all know hwood doesnt listen to fans, they listen to advertisers which drives films now. There is a reason this hasnt been advertised all over social media its because they know its a stinker. There is not an ounce of originality in that business anymore only formulas that advertisers demand. Skip it.","

Argylle," Fun...despite the negative reviews.
",teaneedz,04-Feb-24,"Despite some of the negative reviews, I enjoyed the dive into the world of ""Argylle,"" and what a fun ride it was! This film is a lighthearted take on espionage, filled with humor, intrigue, and action that kept me glued to my seat from start to finish. What really sets it apart are the unexpected plot twists that caught me off guard at every turn, showcasing the filmmakers' ingenuity and ensuring that ""Argylle"" is unlike any spy movie I've seen before.Bryce Dallas Howard shines brightly in this film, delivering a performance that is nothing short of outstanding. Her magnetic presence on screen captivated me, effortlessly balancing high-octane action with moments of lightheartedness. Howard brings a sophistication and humanity to her role, making her character not just relatable but truly inspiring. I also enjoyed her for not being shamed into losing weight while showing that sensuality incorporates curvy confidence. Yes, she looks amazing.The film's approach to lighthearted spy fun is something I particularly enjoyed. It's refreshing to see a spy thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously, sprinkling genuine laughter and joy throughout its suspenseful and exciting narrative. This balance ensures that ""Argylle"" offers a delightful change of pace from the typical entries in the genre.An unexpected highlight for me was Alfie the cat. This furry scene-stealer brought an extra layer of charm and whimsy to the movie, instantly winning me over. Alfie's inclusion is a testament to the film's creativity and its willingness to play with conventions, adding to the overall enjoyment and uniqueness of the experience.""Argylle"" is an absolute triumph and needs to be enjoyed for the lighthearted fun it is. With Bryce Dallas Howard's phenomenal lead, a series of jaw-dropping plot twists, and an undercurrent of lighthearted fun, this film is a must-see. And let's not forget Alfie the cat, who adds that perfect touch of delight to an already fantastic cinematic journey.P. S. Cranston is always a great actor in any movie too.","

",akpatton12,03-Feb-24,"You absolutely have to just abandon reality and enjoy the movie. While Argylle doesn't have the same level of fight scenes, cinematography and soundtrack as the Kingsman, it is still a wild and entertaining ride. Sam Rockwell kills the comedic relief and is a joy to watch. The chemistry between him and Bryce Dallas Howard is lacking but STILL, a great and fun movie to watch. Henry Cavill could ALWAYS use more screen time in my opinion, but the reviews stating he's absent is just not accurate. His presence is equal to that of which his character deserves.

I can't imagine such a dumb story with even dumber plot twists and dancing+fighting scenes glorifying cat ladies would ever be written in a serious way.The movie starts intriguing, then quite early becomes cringe as the charming spy man is becoming a hobo-like spy, then adds plot twists that I explained them in depth one by one to the ear of my wife during the screening because they were so obviously cringe they would have to happen. I mean, I can imagine vividly the teenager say ""and then, they realize it's not the man who is important but the main lady who seemed shy at first"" or ""then they danced whilst fighting showing their love for eachother as they beat bad guys"" or ""then she put on makeshift ice skates and beat all the bad guys"" or ""and then the black lady from the start is saving her as she was hypnotized at the last minute and tells her she was the secret fan all along!"". Those scenes not only belittle all the viewers, are extremely cringe and make me wanna puke all the popcorn I ate, but are also ruining all the talent you've wasted by paying them huge sums to play at your movie.AVOID THIS while you can.

And I laughed when Sam rockwell through a cat off a building.The preformances were incredibly disappointing with such an all star cast(not Sam rockwell). The plot itself might have been a good idea in theory but it was put really poorly onto screen. Each plot twist was as ridiculous, silly and uninspiring as the last.

Argylle," It's Not Worth Your Money
",davidisepic,08-Feb-24,"Maybe I bought tickets for the wrong movie, because anyone giving this 10/10 didn't watch what I did. The first 40 minutes were pretty good, but after that it was garbage. This film is a disgrace to the A-list actors involved and is beyond ridiculous, to the point of lunacy.They overdid the ""crazy plot twists"" by about 3 or 4 too many (I'm not exaggerating), the plot made no sense, they defied the laws of gravity, physics, and logic, the poorly choreographed fight scenes killed my soul, the special effects seem to come from a free app on an iPhone, the list goes on and on.I'm pretty easy to please with movies, but this was awful in every way, shape, and form. Anyone who says to go in and just ""enjoy the show"" should stick with Barbie, Star Wars 7-9, and Zoolander, where that kind of childish mentality and little regard for the plot belongs.If you're looking for a halfway decent action movie with good dialogue, a plot that isn't absurd, visually pleasing fight scenes, and at a moderate length, put this movie at the very, VERY, bottom of your list. Take it off the list, honestly.I will never get those 2 hours/20 minutes (and $5, mind you) back, and I'm begging you to read this and go see another movie.I usually don't care enough to leave reviews on IMDB (this is literally the first I've ever written) and that should tell you how AWFUL I feel this show is.","

Argylle," It is a movie for writers
",mcatalin94,07-Feb-24,"This movie excels in so many ways, but in order to see that you have to notice the obvious - the action throughout the storyline it is clearly not real. Things happen just like in a story; everything happens for the main characters. And there are clues for this everywhere. There are fairy tale moments everywhere which wouldn't happen in real life, so you got to imagine that everything you see is a brainstorm of ideas within the book. And within a book crazy and fantastical things happen. Cliches happen. And for the love for the characters it does happen for a writer to see the characters around, as so great is the connection with them. Most of the people failed completely on watching the movie as they should've and it is such a shame. As a writer you'd know that there is so much going on in your head - and that is what it is - a story within the writer's head.","

",joachimokeefe,07-Feb-24,"TL:DR It's 'Argyle', or 'Argyll'. If you can't get that right, you won't get anything else right, and they didn't. It's like saying 'Alabamma', or 'Pariss'. Or 'Applle'. You've seen all of this before.INTERIOR: DRAUGHTY-LOOKING MOSQUE-BASED NIGHTCLUB. DAY.What's with his hair? Has he been using Miracle-Gro instead of Wash'n'Go? He looks like a squeezed tube of black toothpaste. There are two kinds of people in this film: men trying to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, even Bryan Cranston whose fame went to his head, and women who look like they've neglected to do their roots. Apart from Applle herself, who looks like Taylor Swift did fifteen years ago, without the curls, and without the talent.In every scene there are security guys/bouncers; presumably to keep the actors on the set, because nobody with any self-esteem would have stayed on set for thirty seconds.The script was written after the plastic action figures were designed.In fact, it was plastic action figures that wrote it.It's a sad fact that some 50-90% of movies made before 1950 are irretrievably lost. It's even sadder that 'Applle' will never join them.","

Very quickly it deteriorates into absolute stupidity. I'm all for outrageous, ridiculous farces but this film is just plainly stupid. It's interminably long and what pass as plot twists are of eyerolling inanity. Sure, it's supposed to spoof the genre but it doesn't even do that in a clever way. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara try to bring something to the story but even their efforts are wasted. Samuel L. Jackson makes a pointless contribution. It could have been a decent film if the writers had reigned it in. Do not waste your money, or especially your time(!), on this heap of fetid garbage.","

Argylle," Too long, boring and generic
",Dello_,05-Feb-24,"The root of all the issues of ""Argylle"" is the length. Indeed ""Argylle"" is by nature a stupid film that can be funny only for a certain amount of time and then it becomes boring. Indeed the plot is simple by itself and cutting 30 minutes would have been beneficial. In particular, the last part of the film is a sequence of plot twists coming out of nowhere (they were not built and so they don't feel earned) which are made possibile thanks to a series of plot conveniences. Knowing what type of movie ""Argylle"" is, it's celar that a certain amount of them are justified and they can be accepted but after a certain point not so much. Furthermore the CGI is pretty bad in few instances with very visible green screens and the 30 minutes less would have helped focusing better on that aspect too.I was expecting ""Argylle"" to be funny, with great action scenes and good jokes but unfortunately it was only generic and the length didn't help. A movie that I tend to associate with ""Argylle"" is ""Bullet Train"" with Brad Pitt because the general idea is the same: a funny, stupid and kinetic spy movie that has the only scope of entertain. The difference between the two is that ""Bullet Train"" is shorter, more coherent and shot better thus achieving a great sense of fun. On the other hand ""Argylle"" is too chaotic. In particular I was enjoying the movie till the big twist on the Bryce Dallas Howard character. Indeed I think the movie on one hand loses its originality and it goes to a pretty generic plot seen many times and on the other hand it introduces a whole new situation thus further extending the runtime.In the end I found ""Argylle"" fun at the beginning but progressively boring and boring with a series of criminal sequences in the third act that really pushed me more and more outside of the atmosphere (I'll cite only the two worst: the skating scene and the pipe in the head). Personally I wouldn't suggest it and I am disappointed because I was hoping to see a stupid but fun spy movie. In any case if you know you generally like this kind of movies I suggest you to try it out because there is the potential to appreciate something if you are able to pass on some issues.","

Argylle," When you order James Bond from Wish
",TomTalksFilms,04-Feb-24,"Argylle is a newly released spy/thriller directed by Matthew Vaughn of Kingsman fame. Bryce Dallas Howard stars as the main protagonist Ellie Conway who is a fictionally acclaimed author of a series of spy novels. Whilst trying to finish the final chapter of her fifth novel she is interrupted by Sam Rockwells character Aidan, a stranger who informs her that the events portrayed in her books have actually taken place. As a result she must now work to finish the fifth book whilst being pursued by the 'the organisation' who are the villains of her own books in order to save her own life.This film has been largely panned by critics and for the first ninety minuets of its two hours and twenty minute run time I was unsure as to why. There seemed to be an interesting story building around this writer and what is and isn't the reality of the situation. I found the film to be most interesting in the brief time that Ellie is unsure whether to trust Aidan as that's where the tension really held up well.Quite early on into the second half of the however I felt the film showed its cards too early. We quickly start to learn more about the reality of the situation and the more I found out the more that tension evaporated until quite quickly all that was left to be enjoyed about the film was the action sequences.The action sequences themselves are pretty much what you would expect from the director of Kingsman. Very stylised and over the top and yet with no blood as of course they had to get that PG-13 rating. The difference between this and Kingsman though is that this film really goes balls to the wall with the action sequences, dare I say borderline Fast and Furious levels of bs at times. This took all the grittiness that makes action sequences enjoyable away and drew my attention towards the shoddy CGI work even more.One thing this film did do a good job of though was its marketing. Clearly a lot of money was put into it as the trailer for this film was everywhere and if you've ever seen a film before in your life then I'm sure you've had it recommended to you somewhere online. The trailer and the poster for that matter make it look like Henry Cavill is the protagonist however that's very much not the case. He's completely wasted to be honest so avoid this one if he was one of the big selling points of this film for you.Props to the marketing team for a great exercise in misleading cinema goers.Overall I can't help but feel this was a concept with a lot of potential most of which was wasted by the end of the film. Perhaps a different writer and director could have done a better job.","

Having him in a completely pointless cameo role is just stupid.Honestly, the film would've worked so much better.As it is, this film blows, for the following reasons:1. Sam Rockwell is just dull and uncharismatic in this role. BDH is okay.2. It's basically a re-telling of The Long Kiss Goodnight. Once you find that out, the film relies on pointless uber-CGI scenes, which drag on way too long, and frankly suck.3. The end scene linking it to the King's Men films is self-indulgent crap. Those films (aside from the first one) suck.4. The director apparently said: ""he needed someone who was born to play James Bond - which Henry is - and then nick him before Bond's studio did.""

Argylle," Apple should stop making movies - Stick to tech please!!
",shaneparmar,07-Feb-24,"This in addition to Napoleon and any other Apple made movie i've seen.Enough is enough.Nearly every scene is done on a green screen so there's some cheap looking static cgi background, so you feel like you're in a series of Zoom calls, even when there is motion they look so poorly done, comparable with 1000's of cheaply made YouTube videos.The only difference is they use their huge budget to bring in big stars to draw interest in their movies but I guess this is why they don't promote it being an Apple movie until it's too late and you're already committed to watching.They take the opportunity to showcase as many Apple products as possible in such an obvious way, it's pretty frustrating, let alone their plots are all over the place.Literally every single time I see ""Apple Movies"" or whatever they're called at the start of a film, I immediately think should I suffer through this or just walk out now?I left with 20 minutes to go, in an IMAX cinema last night. They're just so painful to endure, it's really not worth anyones time.Boycott all Apple movies, they're destroying cinema.","

Argylle," The Acting and the Action Save Argylle from Completely Careening Off the Cliff
",CANpatbuck3664,03-Feb-24,"I won't beat around the bush when I'm discussing what didn't work in Argylle but I would feel remiss if I also didn't credit what worked in this mixed bag of a movie. The first obvious positive is the cast, there's some serious wattage from their collective star power. Starting with our lead Bryce Dallas Howard, I think she did about as good of a job as could reasonably be expected. She's certainly done no favours by the script, her character's motivations and personality shift on a dime (sometimes from scene to scene). She does what she can in the action, she gets a few laughs as the smart yet dowdy Ellie Conway and she has some palpable chemistry with her primary co-star. Henry Cavill's is well cast as the stoic yet fully capable Agent Argylle. I like watching Cavill in action movies period, he's got the physicality for the stunts/choreography and the talent to bring some personality to the characters he plays. He's appropriately suave here and it looks like he's having fun. I actually wish we had gotten even more time with this character. I want to tip my hat to Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara respectively. They're both in roles which would have been easy to phone in, the angry spy chief and the supportive but out-of-touch mother. But Bryan brought some intensity/gravitas as Director Ritter and Catherine was funny even though her character is s cliche. As much as I really liked the entire cast, there was one performance that stood out among the rest. Sam Rockwell is a fantastic talent even on his worst day but he was awesome as Aidan Wilde. He has an effortless charm and a seemingly easy but deceptively sharp comic delivery that mesh so perfectly with his secret agent character. Even when Argylle was about to collapse, his shared chemistry with Howard helped keep the movie above water. I'd love to offer further comments on Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena as Alfie and Wyatt but they're in the movie so briefly, I feel like I can't grade them accurately. I did also want to congratulate Dua Lipa, she also doesn't have much screen time but she nailed the seductive and dangerous vibe of her character Lagrange. I'd like to see her in a James Bond-esque movie in a similar style of role, I was very impressed.The other clear standout aspect is Matthew Vaughn's filming style for the action scenes. He and his crew know how to bring a sense of danger (through the choreography and the editing) to punch up what could be rote. I did wish that Argylle would have gone full Kingsman and done it with an R rating but Argylle still had it's moments even if it was a little more subdued. My favourite was the scene on the train but Vaughn and his crew's fingerprints are all over all the action bits and they fit the bill for what the genre requires.I try to form my own opinions about the movies I watch, the critics can be right or wrong depending on the movie and the viewpoint. But I have to admit, when it comes to Argylle's missteps, the group of them more or less nailed it. People have been quick to point the finger at Matthew Vaughn for Argylle's messy plot and pacing (he should at least share the blame but he's not the sole offender) but I want to point out writer Jason Fuch's screenplay for fumbling the story repeatedly. Argylle can't make up its mind on where to stop twisting the story, this might seem like nit-picking but watch the movie, I guarantee you'll be shocked at how many times plot twists feature. Agent Argylle seems like a real person part of the time but then in the next scene, he's a figment of Ellie's imagination. There's some badly needed clarity to what is actually going on, especially later in the film. It was just shift after shift and while I normally like a good plot twist, by attempt #5 I was just groaning in my seat or quietly yet still saying WTF out loud. I think the plausibility goes out the window early and just never comes back and as much as Argylle isn't supposed to be realistic, the creative team needs to put enough effort in so I don't disconnect from the movie completely. The long run time compounds this problem, you could have shaved about 30 minutes off this movie without losing anything relevant to the plot. The decision to keep so much in just adds to the movie's pacing problems and it made me yearn for Matthew Vaughn's better previous works. I also couldn't help but feel a little cheated as half of the cast that feature in the poster have so little to do in the movie that it almost felt like false advertising.I so badly wanted Argylle to be good. I love some of Vaughn's previous work (I adore the original Kingsman and X-Men: First Class is my favourite X-Men movie). But Argylle is at best a mixed bag with some redeeming qualities that are outweighed by some baffling choices in the screenplay and an unfocused story. If you take Matthew Vaughn's flair out of the movie (the movie does have cool locales, costumes, set dressing and some good looking CGI), there's so little left here minus the cast. I'm going to have to reluctantly give Argylle a 6/10 and I do feel like I could have graded it much more shrewdly. I still enjoyed Argylle and I would recommend it if you enjoy spy movies and frenetic action but the overall appeal isn't going to transcend like Vaughn's Kingsman franchise. Turn your brain off and keep expectations low, Argylle may work for you better than first thought.","

Argylle," Henry Cavill? Nowhere To Be Seen
",pete-murphy97,08-Feb-24,"Argylle is once again a film that rests its value and dignity as a cinematic production on the back of parading a literal fluffy cat to drive positive ratings and views; just look at the film's posters! Cinema-goers are in a feline frenzy, apparently. The square-haircut donning albeit dapper Henry Cavill was effectively nowhere to be seen; he was literally (and quite laughably) a figment of imagination in this film, a spectre of perhaps a better film haunting this one, Cavill is reduced to a window licker, an outsider looking in with the audience frustratingly powerless to give him a more prominent part. I, and I'm sure many others, went into this expecting Cavill to play the main character; this is not the case at all despite a trailer giving every impression it would be Cavill playing a debonair Argylle-patterned spy.The film's premise isn't all that bad, it's about a female author, Elly Conway, of the ""Argylle"" books, who has a special connection to her literary works that's revealed in a later plot twist. That twist is based on audience expectations of who and what a ""spy"" should actually look like in reality. A suavely suited Henry Cavill? Well, maybe, although not necessarily. The meta-narrative concept that unfolds from there is scattered, jarring, and unfocused.The cast is absolutely stacked. Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Henry Cavill, Sofia Boutella, Dua Lipa, Ariana DeBose, John Cena, and Samuel L. Jackson. But it really felt as if this was an amateur film and these talents were wasted in the absence of a strong through-line.2/10.","

",niallmacmillan,03-Feb-24,"Sam Rockwell is the best part about this film. The twist of who Argyle is just so unbelievable and there were just so many twist and turns that just lead to more crappy twist and turns that you left no really knowing or caring about the characters or what is really going on. Bryce was likeable at the beginning of the film and then lost me.I just don't really know what this film is trying to be. A parody of spy films or a comedy. I think I laughed twice. Is it trying to be really clever and different? It's almost too clever for itself and so many big names of the cast like Cena and Cavill are just wasted.It was like a really crappy version of the Kingsman films, which I think is disrespectful to such films and to highlight how dull and poor this film, I'm writing this in the final act of the film at the cinema.","

But none of those come close to how this film made me feel.The first half hour had me involved, and I was enjoying the storyline, characters included the fat puff head Alfie.But not long after the London scenes I started to see flaws, flaws I tried to ignore and give Matthew Vaughan a chance with what he was going for. But this film ain't another Kingsman film, so don't be fooled people!This is the first film I have watched in my life where I was ashamed of the word ""acting"". I understand people need to be paid, but when you're Samuel L Jackson- do you really need to put yourself through this? These Hollywood a-listers get paid millions to put together this garbage together just for us general public to watch it. They should be ashamed of themselves.Yes you're right I didn't have to see this. But I'm a movie fan and I am big Sam Rockwell fan, but God above
did this make me feel confused to be a human being.I won't ruin the movie for people as I think everyone should watch this diabolical mess to make them realise how wonderful life is and how grateful we can all be to live on this beautiful planet.I thought I understand movie making, but now I don't even understand life itself.

Those dance scenes were not funny at all, very cringey!! I felt embarrassed to be watching that muck!!4. Cena and Dua Lipa were both underutilised.5. So many good actors with so little to do.6. Again, putting Henry Cavill as the top bill, but then giving him a few minutes of screentime....!!I feel sorry for the poor man.Overall, a dumb and dismal movie.The only good thing to come out of this movie I hope will be to put the team off the idea of making more movies in this series.","

Argylle," Spy world torn with fresh trends, accompanied by adorable meows!
",folk_egm,01-Feb-24,"In summary, this film by director Matthew Vaughn successfully delivers a return to form, providing viewers with over 2 hours of full enjoyment. It is rich with stylishly curated action scenes that align with the director's signature style. The spy world presented in the movie takes a refreshing and unconventional approach, featuring characters who are more ordinary than the traditionally handsome and beautiful spies. The film seamlessly blends elements of romantic comedy and biting humor into the spy genre. It comes with the central theme that the more skilled a spy is, the better they can smoothly lie, which adds complexity to the story. The film cleverly breaks the mold several times, always with reasonable explanations. Additionally, the movie heavily incorporates the selling point of cats, bringing a playful and irresistible charm to the film. The scenes with the cat character contribute to the comedic and quirky identity that cannot be ignored. This film is a colorful and captivating story, particularly appealing to cat lovers.","

The one big criticism I have is there is some god awful CGI where it just wasn't necessary. Two characters spinning around in a circle? Just CGI the background to spin around wildly instead of the actors actually spin around themselves! They somehow managed to make the actual real life cat look fake almost all the time, I don't know how that's possible.Bryce Dallas-Howard still can't be anything other than herself, but Sam Rockwell smashes it out of the park again. The action sequences are fun but also hampered by the ugly visual effects mentioned previously.Go into this movie with an open mind, but knowing you're probably gonna have some good fun with it.

Argylle," Very Bad Movie
",cinemapersonified,03-Feb-24,"Rating: 3.4
Overall, a complete mess on all fronts as the star-studded cast cannot save how bad the direction, technicals, and writing is as this movie should only be watched to see how much Apple wasted on this misfire.Very Bad Direction (the direction on a macroscale is very poor as the action sequences are not that well executed and the world is built using tacky CGI; the direction on a microscale makes no sense as it does not feel like the movie is going anywhere with its interpersonal scenes; the direction of actors is fine mainly because everyone in the cast is an experienced actor (so it makes me believe that no one was actually taking his direction); the storytelling is terrible as the movie constantly tries to go back and forth from with this first person POV where the protagonist is living out the stories she is creating, but then all of a sudden, this gets dropped at the halfway point of the point for their 'big twist'; the tension is not built at all as none of the scenes flow to build tension (all the action scenes just happen in a second)), Decent Acting (Decent from Henry Cavill (Really is just sauve eye-candy; side note, but I feel bad for Henry Cavill because he's a decent actor but is just always in bad projects), Decent to Pretty Good from Bryce Dallas Howard (Does a fine job, but it just honestly feels like she's not right for this character), Pretty Good from Sam Rockwell (The only performance with any positive outcome on the movie as his charm and humor make the movie somewhat bearable (mainly because he is just playing himself the whole time)), Decent from Bryan Cranston (He's just playing himself as put no effort into the role), Decent from Catherine O'Hara (Really just pulled from her personality and acting experience), Pretty Bad from Dua Lipa (Just eye candy who cannot help that she's not an actress), Decent from Ariana DeBose, Decent from John Cena, Decent from Samuel L. Jackson (They really just wasted his talent in this movie because he's given the most boring character, even though he does a decent job in playing him), Decent from the rest of the cast (Everyone is just kinda there or are truly just background characters)), Very Bad Story (The concept is incredibly stupid as it feels like it was created by a five-year-old (especially as the movie drags out); the plot structure is terrible because the plot just constantly unravels into an uncontrollable mess that cannot be stopped, and they could have cut 30 mins of fluff and the movie still wouldn't have made any sense); the flow between sequences is practically non-existent because the plot just kept on going in an opposite direction that none of what is going on screen made any sense; the character writing is terrible because they just try to force so much into these characters that they just end up having no personalities or struggles that you care for), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is very bad because there are moments where it is intentionally bad (mimicking the 'Argylle' book), but the rest is still very bad because it is written as if it is a parody of a parody of a spy movie (and this is evident when they 'overload the mainframe' by typing for 5 seconds); the humor is very bad because it tries to make you laugh so many times, but I laughed maybe like once; the symbolism is just inferred as they didn't write these characters deep enough to where you care how they're affected by what's going on; the foreshadowing is practically non-existent as the movie constantly tries to subvert your expectations to the point that it subverts any ounce of realism), Bad Score (Just forced and feels like filler), Very Bad Cinematography (The cinematography just looks so amateur at times because it clearly just shows they were using a green screen/CGI for most of the movie; the frame-rate changes throughout the movie threw me off as it makes me question where the 200 million dollar budget went; the POV, eye-blinking shots just felt so tacky and amateur), Decent Sound, Bad Editing (Just made the movie feel so tacky as many scenes, especially the action scenes, feel so poorly put together), Very Bad Visual Effects (It just looks so obvious where they used green screens and CGI as none of the places look real, also the cat is CGI (which made me lose any hope that this movie was going to look realistic at all)), Bad Production Design (So obvious they used green screens instead of shooting on-site), Bad Makeup (It hurts that they made this a PG-13 movie because there was barely any blood (which made no sense because there were a lot of chest and headshots)), Pacing is incredibly slow because there is just so much meaningless plot (that you just feel bored half the time), Climax is incredibly formulaic and predictable (which is given with the direction the movie was already heading), Tone feels honestly more similar to Drunk History than a funny/light-hearted spy movie because it felt like they were retelling a plot that made no sense (because they were probably drunk when they wrote, directed, shot, scored, edited, marketed, and distributed this movie), They basically threw away their PG-13 F-word.","

Notwithstanding the teeth-hurting visual effects, the nail-biting pacing, and the anxiety-inducing performances. Bryce Dallas Howard plays whatever her character's name is like a schizophrenic high schooler, while Sam Rockwell like my drunk uncle who only shows up at New Year parties with his bad jokes, and I'd rather see Henry Cavill and John Cena make out than having to watch these two feign chemistry. What's the most unforgivable, however, are the action sequences that are predictably scripted, heavily choreographed, poorly shot, confusingly edited, visibly CGIed, and always accompanied by that goddamn cheesy music. This movie is just a total let down compared to Kingsman, and Matthew Vaughn's gotta do better next time.","

Argylle," People are more transparent than they think with their bad reviews
",paulcarr1302,05-Feb-24,"This movie was pure fun. That is what you get with a Matthew Vaughn movie. If you are in the category of thinking his movies are ""good"" in the sense of high quality cinema, then you have bad taste.You get over the top action, with a few very unplausible scenes, you get CGI and stunt work combined. Al most every one of his outings is ""good"" in the sense of you have a good time and enjoy yourself in the theater.The very transparent reason for the bad reviews, whether they'll admit it or not, was the choice of leads. Some outright say they felt cheated that it wasn't Cavill, Cena, and Dua Lipa. I consider these people a special case considering the trailers made it very obvious to me what the plot was. Then you have the ones who think they're clever in hiding it, but all it takes is a read through of the review to know their main problem is being upset with Bryce Dallas Howard being chosen for the role (for multiple reasons). Rockwell to a lesser degree, but not being your ""action star"" prototype.They are just outright wrong though. Rockwell gave your typical Rockwell all out performance that was thoroughly enjoyable, and Bryce Dallas Howard was perfectly cast, and was very good. Yes, the skating scene was particularly ridiculous, but again you'll get those occasionally in his movies, but people are more accepting of it when it's not Bryce Dallas Howard being CGI'd/body doubled. And the dancing shootout people seem to have a problem with fit into the movie well, and leads back to the unspoken complaint being the choice of romantic leads.Listen, if you want a good time go see this movie. You are not going to hate yourself for it. If you want high art, go see something like Poor Things, which is good but has quite a few flaws itself, but less vitriol pointed at it due to it's leads (who were very good as well).","

Argylle," Overall mediocre
",jay-cgn,12-Feb-24,"Well, it was pretty much what I expected after the trailer.Basically this a mix of various films: the build-up is Lost City, major plot points are taken from the Mission Impossible franchise- all mixed with the roughness of Kingsman and Bullet Train. That's it! And that would be ok, not everything needs to be unique and completely new to be good entertainment.BUT although having a great cast, this movie won't work. It never gets very funny or builds up real tension- not even with many twists. That is something to achieve- sadly.Still it is a movie you can watch, but don't have to see. It is mediocre- sounds hard it is the best description. If you haven't seen any of the mentioned movies it might be a bit better, but for the frequent movie goer like me, it was a bit disappointing.To close with the biggest down point- the effects are miserable. Especially in the first car chase scene everything looks like a cheap computer trick the can be better since the last 20 years. This is an Apple Movie in 2024. I mean, driving a strange convertible car down over the roofs of Greek houses and the actor sits in it like playing a scene on the sofa for his family- this is badly animated and executed. As Apple I would not want to have that in my lineup. Sure, it's not Apple themselves who is responsible for the effects, but if they order or produce the movie, they should not want to be related to such poor quality. And besides everything else, this is without any discussion something that can be done better- way better.","

Argylle," A welcome respite at this weak movie time of the year.
",JohnDeSando,02-Feb-24,"I never expect much from pre-Oscar movie releases, except for maybe The Silence of the Lambs and Everything Everywhere All at Once. Argylle is a mild surprise this February, not the caliber of the two aforementioned-Oscar winners, but enjoyable enough, and imaginative enough, to be mentioned in their presence. If you hope it's better than the Kingsman influence, it is (the same director brings it in), while it can't beat his genre-subverting superhero take Kick-Ass.Argylle can be downright silly in the face of a solid premise. It's a spy spoof, risible along the lines of the recent Knives Out or Murder on the Nile, if they were espionage takeoffs. Introverted novelist Elly (Bryce Dallas Howard) is completing the latest edition of her agent Argylle (Henry Cavill) spy novels when she is spun into a version of her novels all too real as a rogue spy division attempts to kidnap her for her forecasting gift, which has real-world plots that bad boys can use.With Sam Rockwell playing a non-fictional spy, Aiden, and Bryan Cranston sneaking about as a kingpin mostly wringing his hands at incompetent goons, characters combine the humor of the satire with the tension of a Bond thriller having its tongue firmly in place. Samuel L. Jackson as a key component never hurts any spy satire either.Besides the humor, director Vaughn and writer Jason Fuchs have colorful set ups and welcome twists with magic-realism touches that complement the conjunction of Elly's writing and the reality of espionage.Too many working parts and characters, together with some cheesy CGI, mar an otherwise welcoming comedy at this dead-zone time of year. After all, how much Oppenheimer and Maestro can you take before you despair about life in general?Just to see Cavill in one of cinema's best hairdos makes you happy to be lying in the lounge chair of a fancy theater, eating your bucket of popcorn, and shouting to your bud while no one else is there. That's real enough for this hungry critic.As fir the cat, you'll buy the back-pack, guaranteed.",NA

I'd say it were about 10.Bad CGI as always, really bad written characters and way too fast, although it lasts 2,19 hours. They had so many great actors and just didn't used it at all. Normally I love seeing Samuel L. Jackson because of the charisma he puts into his characters, but this time his character was just so empty, which isn't his fault.This movie marks the point for me where I realize that we are not (hopefully not never again) going to get a really really good movie in the next years.My hope is on the old filmmakers, but soon they are going to stop, what then?","

Argylle," Fun, all action spy romp, with a cat
",comps-784-38265,01-Feb-24,"First off we went to see this on the spur of the moment and had absolutely no idea what it was about.I saw 'Argyll' and a picture of a cat ,so assumed it was going to be some form of 'talking cat' type movie. (which it's not)Immediately hooked into the story that unfolded - a spy/espionage all action romp.Imagine a mix of the 'Kingsman' and 'Jewel of the Nile' and you get the flavour of 'Argyll'. We found it highly entertaining, the script and storyline works well, particularly with such a strong cast.We went with no expectations and came out having really enjoyed it (which is quite rare these days)A very solid 7.5-8/10 . Well worth a watch.","

Argylle," IGNORE these sad critic reviews
",tibble-90468,03-Feb-24,"Ignore the sad critic reviews who are only looking for the next Oscar feature. Watch this film with an open mind and enjoy it. It's fun, funny and thoroughly enjoyable in the cinema. As well as having a possible link with kingsman another fun spy franchise what more could you want.The plot itself has many twist and turns which keep it fresh and the watcher on your feet. Some beautiful locations shot in the film.The only thing I would say is the CGI isn't perfect but again it's good enough to keep you watching, laughing and enjoying the whole way through.Oh and the fact the cat is dragged around everywhere is also a great touch!","

Argylle," The CAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",Windermere2,03-Feb-24,"There is a cat in this movie, who is somewhat of a main character, and that's all you need to know! It really steal the show sometimes.The good:Story-wise, the plot twists are rather interesting. The story begins slowly but then rapidly takes off in a different direction.Good performance from Cavill, Howard, Rockwell and Cena, who really captured the energy from their roles and had great chemistry.The world they live in is not meant to be taken seriously, a much more tolerable version of John Wick. Got a few chuckles out of me. One of those movies where you need to suspend the disbelief as it is nonsensical action but at least it does not take itself too seriously, which makes it work.The bad:Part of the story is a bit too long as it repeats it self often bordering ad nauseum but stopping short of crossing that line.Not enough screen time for the cat.The neutral:Some Kingsman references that took me a while to place.","

Argylle," The worst movie I have ever seen
",mgor_82,10-Feb-24,"Wasted 2 hours of my life on this trash. Started out somewhat interesting and got exponentially worse towards the end. Neither funny nor entertaining. I'm embarrassed for high caliber actors that decided to participate in this garbage movie. No plot. The only good part of this movie were the first 30 seconds containing Dua Lipa which the audience was tricked into thinking she was part of the movie. Considered walking out a few times which I've never done but decided to stick until the end. That was a mistake. Horrible CGI, bad acting and a plot made up by a concussed person on heroin while smoking pot and during Jack. Save 2 hours of your life!","

Argylle," Stranger than Fiction meets Knight and Day
",DarkVulcan29,05-Feb-24,"There are a lot of twists and turns you almost don't see coming a mile away, but I won't give those away, it has to be seen to be believed.Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a writer for Argylle, a series of spy novels. One day while taking a trip meets Aiden (Sam Rockwell) who says he's a spy, soon realizes her life is in danger, and discovering that it's all connected to her novels.A very well made action spy comedy, pulls out all the stops quite perfectly. Howard and Rockwell play off each other perfectly, they just clicked almost instantly. Henry Cavill and John Cena are good the amount of time they are in the film, so are Bryan Cranston and Catherine O' Hara. Action scenes are pretty good also.","

",suss-36725,03-Feb-24,I loved it and did not spend any time looking at my phone. That usually happens when I watch movies that are boring or too long. The plot is not very plausible as mentioned but it's really funny! There is always something going on. Ive read moslty bad reviews in the papers but I dont think they were the target audince so I can understand why they felt that. Most were there to watch a HC action movie and were dissapointed when he was not that present in the movie. I'm not a fan of his (yet) so I did not care. Im a single lady who loves cats and cheesy romantic action movies sp this was spot on for me. Im even gonna watch it again :D I thought it was that funny :D Some really good plot twists and some things you expected would happen. But as I mentioned I love the movie.,"

Argylle," The Greater the Spy, The Bigger the Lie
",UnderTheScene,04-Feb-24,"Argylle was one of the biggest releases this year, especially with such a star-studded cast. Matthew Vaughn brought his unique style from ""Kingsman"" into a new take on a spy thriller. When Elly Conway's fictional espionage novels begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past. This being such a bland take as it was a story/concept we have seen before and felt reused. Pilled on with unappealing action sequences, that tried to carry off ""Kingsman"" success but failed to do so. However, I must say thank goodness for Sam Rockwell otherwise this film could've easily been lower rated. Every second he was on screen added enough redeeming points as he was the true star of this picture. Overall, with the slight plot twists here and there as well the cast, it was enough to provide just an ok watch. Hopefully the next Matthew Vaughn project goes back to his original roots.","

Argylle," A poor man's Kingsman
",joe-hookham,07-Feb-24,"I do enjoy silly movies, but this one didn't lean into it hard enough, and the 3rd act seemed like they'd stopped trying refine the dumb ideas.A lot of wasted talent in this film, and Bryce Dallas seemed like the wrong choice, she definitely didn't sell the character towards the end.This movie is a fine example of the over use of illumination and HD lenses; most scenes looked off and shallow, like it was filmed on a green screen - even in just living room scenes. On top of that, the actual CGI was pants.There was a lot of ""violence"" and body count in the film, but with it being a 12A, they had to minimalise the blood and visuals and made the action look all the more fake and low stakes.Finally, after then nth twist, you just felt like you were playing action / spy cliche bingo.","

Argylle," Ridiculously Stupid and Unwatchable!
",I-love-Popcorn,05-Feb-24,"Apple has been in the movie business since 2019 and it has already won the prestigious Best Picture Oscar in 2021 for CODA.Past year in 2023 they produced the big-budget movies ""Napoleon"" and ""Killers of the Flower Moon"". Both of them are very long, high profile, and produced by great directors, but commercially not a success.This Apple + production is directed by Matthew Vaughn known for ""Layer Cake"", ""The Debt"", ""Eddie the Eagle"" and ""Tetris"" but also unfortunately for ""Kick Ass"" and ""Kingsmen"" movies.The spy action comedy ""Argylle"" (2024) is a mixture between the silly Kingsmen franchise movies and ""The Bullet Train"". The director had aspired to make an 80s-style Die Hard movie.All these movies share a very high budget, in this case, $200 Mio, to pay the popular GenZ cast (Dua Lipa, John Cena, Samuel L. Jackson) and recognizable faces like Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell and Bryan Cranston among them they share 2 Oscar-winners and 3 Oscar-nominees.The remaining budget is spent on advertisements similar to ""Barbie""! The plot is generic and bland, it is almost as if Chat GPT had written it based on some crowd-pleasing random keywords, who knows? The humor is super cheesy, the acting is bad except for Sam Rockwell and absolutely no money is spent on proper CGI.The movie was initially planned as a series and thank God it is already considered as a major flop._Do the world a favor & *skip this one!*_Watch instead the true crime spy classic ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (2002) with the stellar cast of Sam Rockwell, Julia Roberts, Georg Clooney, and Drew Barrymore.","

Argylle," Fun action movie to escape reality
",andrea-ee2,06-Feb-24,"I just saw this movie in the theatre with my daughter and it was a good family movie for older kids. It is nearly 2.5 hours long so make sure you bring snacks!Was there violence? Yes but it wasn't disturbing or gory. There was no foul language and no sex scenes. There are a few moments that amount to a jump scare but they don't look realistic.The storyline was decent and the pace was good. I didn't see most of the plot twists coming,so it wasn't quite predictable.The music used wasn't popular hits, if there were I think it would have made me form a deeper connection with the characters. Some of the CGI was ridiculous but in action comedy movies, you go to the theatre to escape reality.It was nearly 2.5 hours long but most scenes didn't drag out. Would recommend.","

And the fact that my daughter, being a cat girl, will absolutely love this movie, made me realize I'll be watching it a second time in the theater not too long from now. Once I realized the premise of where it was coming from, this movie was completely endearing and a lot of fun. Can only hope there is a book 7 :)","

Argylle," fun, tacky, colorful, overlong and with wrong marketing about the stars
",Jithindurden,03-Feb-24,"From the posters, I was expecting a fun movie starring Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa but it turns out they were just cameos, Cavill's role can be said as an extended cameo really. The actual main leads are Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell and they could've used a little more chemistry between them. The movie is full of twists and turns and madness that can be expected from the director of Kingsman. But the worldbuilding is kind of all over the place and the movie runs 20 minutes too long. It would've worked way better under two hours or if they could've included more information, even exposition at times just to make the pacing better. The plot gets a little convoluted but we are not supposed to lose our heads over it, it is supposed to be all fun but, it doesn't always work. Despite all the problems I had with it, it was so much fun. The visuals were gloriously tacky as designed to be. The ending revealing even more twists and setting up sequels and prequels were done very smartly and didn't feel like adding just for the sake of it. So, even though not as fun as the Kingsman movies, this is an okay spy action comedy that manages to be fun even with all of its flaws.I have to add that the chemistry between Henry Cavill and John Cena at the end was palpable.","

The action and the visual effects in the film are intentionally bad in some scenes, but those threw me out of the experience. It would've worked more for me if they don't try to separate fiction and reality with the quality of the action and CGI. The movie also tried to be funnier than it really is. The marketing campaign mislead me to think that Henry Cavill was going to one of the main roles, but he wasn't. The cinematography was sometimes good, but sometimes surprisingly bad. I couldn't see what's happening.Sam Rockwell and Bryan Carnston were amazing, Bryce Dallas Howard was also good, but the other cast members did not have their time to shine.This is a fun movie, but I like it more than I should.","

Argylle," Gout holds more adventure
",r_chad_ellis,12-Feb-24,"I watched this movie in the theater. The preceding trailer for The Fall Guy was twice the movie.My mother told me if you have nothing nice to say about someone's acting ability then you shouldn't say anything at all... so I won't discuss Bryce Dallas Howard. Although her father DID make ""Solo"". That does help lessen the blow
.Sam Rockwell WAS good. And he got to dance. But he should fire his agent.Without revealing much of the plot, Howard's character is a writer whose main creation is a hero of her spy novels. Her life is interrupted by a real spy. As he takes action to save her life, the film slices between images of the real spy taking down bad guys with the fictional hero as our heroine comes to terms with how fantasy has given way to reality. For the creative decision, whoever signed off on continually splicing the two men back and forth should be deported to Fresno and never given access to the general public again. THAT was annoying.Oh, as was the bitter understanding that the overall film was as formulaic as Hollywood and not worth further discussion:Austin Powers (1997) x Cloak and Dagger (1984) x the first 7 minutes of Romancing the Stone (1984) = Forgettable.","

Argylle," Can They Just Stop Already?
",helenahandbasket-93734,08-Feb-24,"I don't know what BDH has on all these people or maybe it's her dad's doing, but she seriously CANNOT sustain an entire movie, especially the mess this 2.5 hour thing is. She's a decent enough supporting character but in no way is she capable of taking an entire film on her back and carrying it across the finish line.The flick is convoluted with farcical puzzles that don't even begin to make sense on the surface, much less diving beneath to explore the subplot that's an even bigger mess. I feel like I was duped into seeing this by the mostly amazing cast, knowing full well anything released after January 1 through to late spring is generally a bit giant nothing, but chucking my knowledge aside because Sam Rockwell and Henry Cavill (of which I absolutely love everything they've done to date). Surely they both wouldn't sign on to a script that was this vapid, right? Catherine O'Hara? I don't think I've ever seen her in anything I wouldn't sit through just to watch her.Hollywood continues to struggle under the delusion that we need them and surely we know how valuable name recognition is and will fork out hard earned cash to see a scant few of the super shiny people, I was falsely hooked by a solid trailer and forged ahead, against my better judgment, despite every bone in my body telling me to run the other way.I and quite a few others left the theater before it even ended it was so horribly written; like this 'author' and her backstory that the powers-that-be inexplicably let languish over all her previous work, but now suddenly there's issues? That's only one example, but I assure you there's so many others.I'm not about giving up the entire game, just trying to tell you that if you just can't help yourself, despite the numerous attempts to warn you, wait for the streaming release. At least then you can forgive yourself for indulging in the privacy of your own home, you didn't have to bundle yourself, traipse through snow, and spend $500 on soda and popcorn.","

Argylle," A Good And Entertaining watch
",justgopi,04-Feb-24,"I don't understand the internet ratings anymore. Movies are subjective, but when your view is too far from the actual entertainment value of the movie it might mislead others who want to see it. Argylle was funny, action packed and emotional at some points. Went to watch this despite the reviews and the ratings. Got hooked to it after 30 mins of the initial setup.It has been 4 years since I wrote a review on IMDB. I felt this one needs a review to subvert the other intellectual movie goers' reviews here. This is an action film with over the top sequences. A great story (Not expecting) and some amazing twists.","

Argylle," Could it have been worse?
",defoypro,05-Feb-24,"Without a shadow of a doubt the biggest pile of nonsensical, childish, thrown together garbage I've had the misfortune to pay to watch.It contains some sequences that are so bad it beggars belief, the scene in which they are dancing and shooting through clouds of brightly colored smoke is the most ridiculous thing I've ever endured whilst sitting in a movie house.I hope these actors got paid well because this is a movie they will look back on and wish they never made it.Fortunately for most their parts are not much more than small cameos to suck people in to believing it's worth watching
Give this a large swerve.","

Argylle," Not worth it!
",nagendramaddula,11-Feb-24,"Today watched this movie in theatre. First few minutes the story was interesting and after that it falls flat. Some of the fight sequences are too stupid and unrealistic. Henry Cavil role could have been longer because that was the only good part of the movie. Bryce Dallas role is not convincing and she doesn't look good in the movie. First half of the movie is ok but second half runs flat with too many twists that seem ridiculous at one point. At the end they showed continuation to second part, I don't think it's required. It's not worth watching this movie in theater and wasting money. You can wait until it's on Netflix or other platforms.","

Argylle," A campy love letter to fans of spy movies
",Blunderbuss_24,04-Feb-24,"A campy, goofy, hilarious, action-packed spy movie that is perfectly self aware and a delight to watch (I already saw it three times). With homages to many spy films that came before, ""Argylle"" balances a reverence for and a subversion of the genre. Ignore the critics who completely missed the point and the essence of this film. Sequel please?The first 2/3 is a solid spy movie with the requisite twists and turns, and the last 1/3 launches the film into full camp mode for anyone who hadn't yet caught on. It is clear all involved had a blast playing while writing/filming, and that playful joy is infectious.Sam Rockwell embodies the chaotic, scrappy, and disheveled spy with a heart of gold, and he pairs delightfully with Henry Cavill's debonair and suave 007-esque persona. I love the dynamic partnership between Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard, and I could watch them dance (figuratively and literally) across the screen any day.","

Argylle," Good action movie
",bfihub,04-Feb-24,"The one thing you need to do before you even sit down (or even buy a ticket) is to suspend your disbelief. If you are expecting James Bond or Mission Impossible, then save your money. Likewise, if you're expecting to see Henry Cavill or John Cena in the majority of the scenes, you'll be disappointed.The story centers around Elly Conway, a writer who writes spy novels. To her, it just comes naturally and people love her books, following Agent Argylle's adventures. Unbeknownst to her, what she's writing mirrors events in real life and she's soon taken away into real life spy adventures.Everything will be explained in the middle of the movie as to why they want Elly.There is one scene towards the end that had me shake my head, but, like I said in the beginning, I had to suspend my disbelief and just enjoy the film, which I did.So if you like satirical spy movies, give this one a go.","

Argylle," Explodes on to the screen but doesn't reach its potential.
",steveinadelaide,08-Feb-24,"Prepare for an exhilarating experience with the film Argylle (2024). It's a blend of action, comedy, and espionage that promises to keep you entertained, although it may not leave an impact. Imagine a world where Elly Conway (portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard), an author famous for her spy novels, discovers that her fictional creations are somehow manifesting in reality. As the boundaries between imagination and perilous international intrigue blur, you'll embark on a journey like The Truman Show colliding with James Bond, sprinkled with the flair of Kingsman.Argylle features a cast comprising Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, and John Cena. Cavill contributes his signature sultry charm, bringing an endearing clumsiness to the spy role of Argylle. Howard delivers a mesmerising performance as she embodies sass and intelligence reminiscent of Joan Holloway from Mad Men. Rockwell steals scenes effortlessly with his portrayal of the villain. However, some characters feel underdeveloped, lacking motivations, and have unexplored backstories.Director Matthew Vaughn showcases awe inspiring techniques throughout the film. The action sequences are meticulously choreographed yet occasionally intense; they're accentuated by slow motion shots and panels that pay homage to comics.The vibrant array of colours immediately grabs your attention, and the overall production design exudes a sophisticated feel. However, similar to consuming excessive amounts of sugar, the constant bombardment of visuals can grow tiresome over time. It left me yearning for more substance in terms of the story and characters.The soundtrack, with its combination of pulsating beats and orchestral flourishes, nicely complements the action. However, when it comes to the dialogue, well, let's just say it won't be winning any awards for its writing. It oscillates between banter and cringe worthy attempts at humour, leaving me longing for more substantial conversations.The editing is sharp and mirrors the film's pace. However, this frenzied energy works against the narrative. It leaves you feeling disoriented and emotionally detached. We never truly get a chance to forge a connection with the characters or fully grasp what's at stake.So what resonated with me? The sheer audacity of this film stands out. It fearlessly tackles something, even if it doesn't achieve it successfully. Most of the performances are enjoyable. There's no denying that the action sequences are impressive (except for the obvious CGI usage). However, the inconsistencies in tone, character portrayal, and indulgent writing style ultimately hinder Argylle from achieving its potential.","

Argylle," What Walt's Watching
",waltermwilliams,05-Feb-24,"Full disclosure I will watch any movie Sam Rockwell (""Aidan"") is in, because he has great comedic timing and more depth than a Shakespearean actor.He stars in Director Matthew Vaughn's spy-themed universe (through his Marv Studios) in what starts off as good, goofy fun, change of pace from Vaughn's usual R-rated ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Layer Cake.""Vaughn himself says he wanted to make a movie his young daughters could see...sure they could watch it, doesn't mean they'll understand this Bond on LSD inspired flick.Vaughn is all about this universe being interconnected and comprising the ""Kingsman"" franchise with the Argylle films, and an unnamed third franchise...apparently.It is a bloated movie that can be exhausting to keep pace with.""Argylle"" has enough enjoyable moments to help you forget it's messy and mostly good fun.Vaughn cast Henry Cavill as ""Argylle"" because he needed someone who was born to play James Bond.Cavill was a finalist to play ""Bond"" in Casino Royale (2006), but was rejected for being too young (22 at the time).This is in fact Henry Cavill's Fourth spy film.The other three are: The Cold Light of Day (2012), The Man from U. N. C. L. E. (2015) and Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018).Even the Director describes this movie as his ode to 1980s action movies like ""Die Hard"" (1988) and ""Lethal Weapon"" (1987), with plenty of ""Bond"" sub flooring.Bryce Dallas Howard as fiction author ""Elly Conway"" named Taylor Swift as an inspiration for her character.Howard's reasoning?, ""She is a cat lady. She's got this awesome backpack with a cat in it that she walks around with. She loves a good argyle sweater, and there is a sort of unapologetic dorkiness about her.""No argument from this critic.""Alfie"" the Cat is played by Chip, actually owned by Matthew Vaughn's wife Supermodel Claudia Schiffer.If she'd married one of the ""Thunderbirds"" instead she could have become Claudia Schiffer-Brains. (Couldn't resist the bad dad joke.)The cast features two Oscar winners in Rockwell and the first Queer woman of colour to receive the statue in an acting category (""West Side Story"") Ariana DeBose.It also has two Oscar nominees in Samuel L. Jackson and Bryan Cranston.Remember Samuel L. Jackson starred as the sociopathic villain ""Valentine"" in Matthew Vaughn's spy movie: ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (2014).The star studded cast also includes Richard E. Grant, whom I follow on Twitter because he's such a talented human being, Singer Dua Lipa as ""Lagrange"" (a tribute to rockers ZZ Top) and Catherine O'Hara (""Home Alone"" and ""Schitt's Creek"")Just for the record ""Argylle"" is named after the argyle diamond design that originated in Scotland and features strongly in the credits and the movies poster.Coming in at around $200 million, this is Matthew Vaughn's most expensive film, and the most expensive film produced by Apple, tied with Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).What have I learned from ""Argylle""?""Vascular Corridor"" is a real thing and you don't want to get it wrong!Watch out for:The train sequence (strongly influenced by ""Bullet Train""), the Mini-Moke Californian chase scene, plus the ice skating on oil scene and the very colourful corridor smoke bomb shoot out.""Argylle"" has lots of moving parts.The recently released found Beatles song, ""Now & Then"" features heavily and sits well in the soundtrack along with another track during the closing credits that would be right at home in ""Skyfall"".Just like the evergreen stage production Agatha Christie's ""Mousetrap"" once you know the secret don't let the cat out of the bag.""Argylle"" has more twists than a packet of ""Twisties"" (a cheddar flavoured snack from Smiths)...because life's pretty straight without Twisties.As they say so often in this movie, ""The greater the spy the greater the lie"" and I'd be lying if I said this was Matthew Vaughn's finest hour, because it's not, but it is an entertaining, laughter filled way to spend over 2 hours at the cinema.Stay for: ""Argylle's"" post-credits scene which is a neon sign pointing directly to Vaughn's massively popular series of Kingsman films.","

",shaikhirshad-41223,02-Feb-24,"Start 15 mins action of this film with Henry Cavil & Dia lipa was really good and kinda hooked me into the film right into it.Screenplay is slow not what I was expecting but yes story goes with the flow.Director Matthew definitely added some unique touch int the script with character changing scenes from real to reel is new to watch but also there are many places that movie lags a bit and seemed boring.There are lots of good moments to enjoy, fum moments with the characters specially conversation between the lead ones and the cat appearance is really funny.There are lot of big names in this film but definitely not utilized properly and kinda there just for marketing for the film.Cinematography & Bgm was good and definitely suitable for the film.Direction could've been better from my expectation because movie feels bored in the mid and not much utilized of the big characters.Bryce & Sam carries the whole film from start to end with brilliant acting and screen presence.Overall definitely a one time watch for fun story, good cinematography & action sequences but don't expect much from the story & screenplay....","

Bryce and Sam were refreshing and played their parts perfectly . Great casting all around. The humor was refreshing ! A bunch of laugh out loud moments. The audience had fun cheering, laughing and giving a great applause at the end of the viewing. The stinger during the credits gives hope you some more to build the franchise.

I loved John Cena's role, the outfits were on point as well.This movie is a must-see, Valentine's Day is around the corner I suggest you go take your partner and go see it.

",abuabukum,02-Feb-24,"This is a great movie to watch alone, as a couple and as a family. There have been many attempts in the past to crack this genre but none have come close to Argyll. It takes you on an emotional swing and lets you think you cracked the movie but then takes you on another twist. I'm giving it a 10 rating because it did what's it was made for. Kept me entertained for the full duration of the movie. Even as the credits rolled I found myself sitting behind listing to the music. The soundtrack is also full of catchy songs. Were there some flaws in the movie? Yes there were. But I'm not going to the cinema expecting movies to be perfect. Rather I want a movie to take me by surprise.","

Argylle," ""ARGYLLE"" REVIEW
",Mr-Topshotta,05-Feb-24,"Directed by Matthew Vaughn. A runtime of two hours and nineteen minutes. With a PG-13 rating.""Elly Conway,"" played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is a prestige author who makes spy novels. She has a whole series called ""Argylle."" In her series, the main character, ""Argylle,"" is played by Henry Cavil. Along with his partners, ""Wyatt,"" played by John Cena, and ""Keira,"" played by Ariana DeBose, do these elaborate spy missions in ""Elly's"" novels.""Elly"" has garnered a lot of fame and notoriety from these books. The only problem is that everything she's writing about is coming true. Now the real head of a corrupt agency called ""The Division,"" led by a man named ""Director,"" played by Bryan Cranston, is out to get her.""Elly"" is nearly done with the new book. They need her to finish writing because it has great implications for things going on currently. It takes a real spy, ""Aidan,"" played by Sam Rockwell, to help get her out of this situation. As real bad guys are out to kill her.""Elly"" doesn't go anywhere without her cat, ""Alfie,"" played by Chip. ""Aidan"" will do his best to protect her from ""The Director"" and his assassins. With an already crazy story, there is still something up. Find out what happens as this novel blends with reality.""Argylle"" was a huge letdown. As whole. At this point, a Matthew Vaughn film will be hit or miss. I like some of the ""King's Man"" films. The only problem is that he does a little too much. The parts you like he keeps adding, making them wonky. Then you have the actual wonky scenes. By the time it's done, you'll be left feeling a little dissatisfied.This film cost two hundred million dollars to make. With an all-star lineup of actors and star power. Like Dua Lipa, Samuel L. Jackson, and Catherine O'Hara, to name a few. The cast alone had to cost a grip. Everything was at no expense. Shockingly, when I saw this was an Apple production, I thought it was going to be good.It wasn't bad; it just wasn't good all the way either. I loved Bryce Dallas Howard. I don't know about Sam Rockwell playing the spy. I do know they went overboard with too many scenes. I was so confused by it all. The action was good at times, but even that went too far.They were little things. I hoped they didn't do the whole film like that because it was creative yet still annoying. I couldn't stand the ending. It seemed like the film never wanted to end. There is even a post-credit scene. Expect a lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of ridiculousness. With a lavish who's who of actors acting in it. I give it two more fires 🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

",fqprkk,03-Feb-24,"Idc. Anyone who hates this movie can't have fun. I'm a huge fan of of movies that have interesting dialogue, complex plot, and well designed themes. This movie has none of that. And that's awesome! It was a goofy, nonsense, fun movie! It didn't have some deep meaning and scenes changed quickly. I will say it was a bit hard to follow along but if you let go and just enjoy, it becomes really fun! I laughed a lot, understood nothing and that's kind of what I expected when I saw a cgi cat flying up in the trailer. I understand if this movie isn't your cup of tea but to each their own. Personally me and my boyfriend had a BLAST watching this movie. Honestly probably better to watch it with friends than alone. If your watching a comedy movie alone... :(","

Really liked Sam Rockwell's character and how he hates the cat 😂 God , I love that cat 🌚. Also the twist about the real agent argylle shocked me.Overall there are some up and downs had in this movie. Some CGI scenes are not promising, also I thought Samuel Jackson gonna be badass like kingsman 1 but somewhat okay I guess. Also Matthew's style of fighting scenes is continue throughout this movie too and those fight scenes are not memorable as kingsman 1,2 but they are pretty good.The most interesting thing was the mid credit that connected to Kingsman universe. Really liked that part too. My idea is this movie deserve atleast 7.5/10 and if you are a kingsman fan, you should watch this too 😌","

A bit over the top, but exaggerated for effect since it's Bryce Dallas Howard's character's novels sort of brought to life.Then we get twists. I was expecting one, but this was twist upon twist and more and more ridiculous until it was just stupid. But I thought, ""Maybe it will pick up for the last third?""No, we got Kingsman 2 BAD. Ugh. Such a waste of so many good actors and ideas. Ariana DeBose was especially done wrong with a tiny part. She deserved way more.The first Kingsman was SO good (save a few unnecessarily raunchy jokes), but the sequel was SO bad. The prequel was at least decent, so I was holding out hope for this film.Save this one for a streaming service down the road, not cinemas.","

It doesn't improve from there.The plot is just abysmally. I can't understand how can experienced people in Hollywood green light this.The cast, which is comprised of brilliant actors, is just wasted.

Argylle," Good film
",wnfp-49071,02-Feb-24,"""Argylle"" falls short of its potential as an espionage thriller, delivering a lackluster and disjointed cinematic experience that fails to engage audiences on multiple levels. Despite boasting a talented cast and a promising premise, the film struggles to maintain coherence and fails to deliver the excitement and intrigue expected from the spy genre.**Weak Plot and Execution:**
The plot of ""Argylle"" is convoluted and poorly executed, with numerous plot holes and inconsistencies that detract from the overall viewing experience. The storyline lacks depth and fails to provide a compelling narrative arc, leaving audiences feeling disconnected from the characters and their motivations. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition that do little to advance the plot and action sequences that feel forced and contrived.**Underdeveloped Characters:**
Despite the efforts of the cast, the characters in ""Argylle"" are thinly sketched and lack depth or complexity. The protagonist is a generic action hero archetype, lacking the charisma and depth needed to make him compelling. The supporting cast fares no better, with one-dimensional characters who serve little purpose beyond advancing the flimsy plot.**Predictable and Formulaic:**
""Argylle"" follows a predictable and formulaic formula, offering little in the way of originality or innovation. The plot twists and turns are telegraphed well in advance, robbing the film of any sense of suspense or tension. The dialogue is clichéd and uninspired, with characters delivering cringe-worthy one-liners that fail to land.**Lackluster Action Sequences:**
For a film billed as an espionage thriller, ""Argylle"" disappoints with its lackluster action sequences. The choreography feels stilted and unconvincing, lacking the fluidity and intensity needed to make the fight scenes engaging. The use of special effects is overdone and distracting, pulling viewers out of the moment rather than drawing them in.**Overall, ""Argylle"" is a forgettable and underwhelming entry into the espionage genre. With its weak plot, underdeveloped characters, predictable storytelling, and lackluster action sequences, the film fails to deliver the thrills and excitement expected from a spy thriller. Viewers would be better off looking elsewhere for their cinematic espionage fix.**","

Argylle," One of the worst movies I have ever seen!
",mchphone,11-Feb-24,"I don't know where to begin, was it suppose to be hookie and cheesy? The first half of the movie I was like , ""it's ok , it may get better"" but it didn't , it just got worse and then really bad. What a waste of money. Ice skating on oil? Really ? That's was the absolute worst! The colored smoke shoot out scene was just about the worst but then to goto the oil ice skate , good lord, who approved that scene! Save yourself the money and just wait for it to be on streaming for free and make sure to drink enough wine to hopefully enjoy this movie. I hope sooner or later they finally make a good movie.","

Argylle," Good Spy, Bad Spy
",blgerrardsw,03-Feb-24,"Argylle promised to be an exciting cinematic experience with its star-studded cast and enticing trailers hinting at a blend of espionage, action, and comedy. Initially, the film captivated me, especially with its unique narrative approach showing the author's perspective intertwined with Hollywood-esque scenes featuring Henry Cavill. However, as the story progressed, it veered off course, bombarding the audience with an abundance of plot twists and reveals, which, while fitting for a spy film, felt excessive.While the actors delivered decent performances, considering their caliber, one would expect more. Sam Rockwell stood out with his entertaining portrayal, while the talents of Brian Cranston, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryce Dallas Howard seemed underutilized, relegating them to the background.In summary, Argylle serves as an entertaining popcorn flick suitable for a weekend outing. However, it falls short in delivering truly inventive storytelling, often resorting to clichés. Although one particular twist surprised me, many others felt forced or gratuitous, detracting from the overall experience.","

Argylle," Not For Everyone, But Perfect For Me
",the_critical_movie_enjoyer,06-Feb-24,"I can totally see why some people would think that Argylle is the dumbest thing they've ever seen in their life. The movie can get so goofy that it will put people that want great storytelling off. With that being said, I love this movie. I think you need to go into it with the right mindset. Don't go into it expecting amazing storytelling or for it to be very deep and smart, because that's not the type of movie it is, nor is it the type of movie it's trying to be. This movie is goofy as hell and it knows it. It is intentionally some of the wackiest stuff ever, and if you are not a film snob, and can sit back, turn off your brain, and just enjoy some wacky fun, you are going to have a blast with this movie. Simply put, Argylle is some of the most fun I've had in a while with Hollywood movies. They just don't make them like this anymore. With so many movies these days having such bland cinematography and direction, with boring action sequences and everything has to be super serious, it was such a blast being able to sit down and just have fun with a movie. The movie has so much style and charm. The direction is phenomenal and it's never a bore to look at. As a huge Matthew Vaughn fan, this movie really rocks for me. It is very similar in tone with, ""The Golden Circle,"" so the best indicator if you'll like this movie or not is if you liked, ""The Golden Circle,"" The action scene in the train oozes so much style and creativity, with it cutting back and forth between Sam Rockwell and Henry Cavill. The camera movement is very fluid and dynamic. Matthew Vaughn really likes to move the camera a lot, as opposed to keeping static shots, and it really shows. It really helps add a lot of style to the fights. The fight was also really funny with how it utilizes the back and forth between Cavill and Rockwell. The scene with Bryce in the bathroom while the fight is going on outside got me dying from laughter, and it's another example of the movie maybe being not for you. The scene with the rainbow clouds in the hallway, and Bryce Dallas and Sam Rockwell are shooting people while dancing like a musical number is so goddamn creative and I absolutely love it. Again, it's just so nice to have a movie that has so much visual flare and style. Especially since movies like this are rare nowadays, it's very nice to have been able to see a movie like that again. And the skating across oil scene is so ridiculously stupid and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but that's the point. The movie knows it's dumb, and it has fun with it. The scene is so well shot and choreographed, the camera is fluid and the music accompanies it perfectly with an appropriately wacky yet majestic soundtrack. This movie, it's just for me. It feels like it was made in every way that I like. And as a plus, the story is actually quite intriguing, entertaining, and was honestly way deeper than I was expecting it to be. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is writing a series of books called Argylle, which is where the movie gets the name from. And the books that she writes are eerily similar to real events that happened that are completely top secret. There is also some nice cinematography in the way that the movie shows how she envisions the scenes when she's writing them, and how when she gets writers block the words fall from the page. The whole movie is very creative in the way that it's shot and portrays the mind of a writer. So the fight scene on the train happens, and we learn that Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell) is actually the real life spy equivalent of Argylle, and that a fake evil organization that she wrote in her books is actually real. The Division is the name of this group and they've been monitoring Elly. The Division is led by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston) and they hope that through the books that Elly writes, they'll be able to locate and destroy a master file that has all of the information on them, and Aidan takes Elly so that he can get the master file first. This leads them on wacky hijinks with tons of fun action, filled with twists and turns. She hears Aidan saying that he wants so murder Conway, so Elly thinks that he is talking about her. She runs away and calls her parents to come help her. It is then revealed that Director Ritter is Elly's dad, and that both of the parents work with the Division, and that the reason that Aidan says that he wants to murder Conway is because he was talking about her mother. The movie has tons of these twists and turns that add to the excitement and adrenaline levels this movie pumps you with. About 20 minutes later it's revealed that the reason that her books are so similar to things that have happened in the past is because she was a spy working with Aidan and their boss Alfie (Samuel L. Jackson) which is why she named her cat the same name, and that all of the books have actually been her re-writing the events of her life before she got amnesia and the Division brainwashed her into thinking that she had a whole different life, with Director Ritter as her dad, so that she would reveal the information that the Division needed through the stories she told in her books, and also that the reason that the book is named Argylle is because her real name was Rachel Kylle aka R. Kylle. It is dumb but really cool and adds to the different elements that make this movie more interesting than just a dumb action movie for me. It also explains why she keeps seeing Argylle in real life, as it was her brain trying to break out of the brain washing and remind her of who she really was. Later after they recover the master file they discover that Elly was also a sleeper agent for the Division who killed the person that they were looking for before she got the amnesia. This story just has so many twists that is is part of the fun, as you're constantly on edge, waiting to see what dumb twist is going to happen next. And the movie is aware of this and is in on the joke, so instead of laughing at the movie, you're laughing with it. From there they get captured by the Division and they have to break out and send the file to Alfie before the Division can erase it. To conclude, the movie is super fun. It has so many fun twists and turns that it leaves you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. It's directed with such style and creativity. All of the actors do such a fantastic job as these characters, and help bring so much life to this movie. And outside of that, the story itself is interesting and captivating, and while not being the most intelligent or deep thing out there, it's part of the charm that the movie goes for. I think that this movie absolutely knocks it out of the park with what it wants to accomplish, and while definitely not for everyone, I had an absolute blast with this movie.","

Argylle," Are not Gylle
",youlesivanson,05-Feb-24,"This movie could be a fun and satirical take on spy films. But a few things affect this film deeply. Firstly, when the trailer includes all the best scenes of the movie, it raises the viewer's expectations, only to leave them disappointed when the actual film lacks any remaining interesting elements. Secondly, it was disappointing that Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena had very small roles. Thirdly, the final 20 minutes of the movie were subpar. It would have been acceptable if the movie had concluded when the plot was revealed. Fourth, the movie's fantasy begins from an interesting point, but as it progresses, it becomes increasingly childish.","

Argylle," Should have kept the cat in the bag
",vvendetta-69078,01-Feb-24,Argylle had promise and maybe that's its biggest problem- it promised so much and didn't deliver. It's like having all the right ingredients and yet overcooking until it ends up better being thrown in the bin than eating. You have to feel for Henry Cavill and all the actors who give it their all as they are let down by the final product. There are some great scenes but the confusing switching within them just adds to the confusion so that it ends up feeling like you are trying to beat a path through a mess of a jungle than being able to relax and enjoy a film. Maybe it was too ambitious but the CGI doesn't help as it tends to distract and again spoils the flow of the movie. I have avoided talking about the plot and intriguing story as it is about the only thing left to enjoy beyond the great performances of the likes of Sam Rockwell. Even great actors can't save this movie from itself...so maybe a trilogy is an ambition too far at this early stage.,"

Argylle," Might as well called it twister
",burntoutboy,01-Feb-24,"Argylle is messy but fun at times and has way too many twists that essentially destroy the point of having a twist.Starts of fine and story is interesting enough to capture your attention especially with the first twist. After that, it's just silly twists and action with way too many green screens. Some of the action is ok and is entertaining but the CGI used just hurt my eyes.I do admit the twists took me by surprise and I did like some of them but they just took it too far.Definitely got a Kingsman vibe from this film and I think it would have benefited from being more gory like Kingsman.Overall not bad but not great. Probably Matthew Vaughns worst film.","

",a-taner,10-Feb-24,"Argylle? What is that? That is the question normally I get. Means no one around me had any idea what Argylle is. Still after more than one week in release it is still a not well known movie. And people don't go often watching movies in these times of the year.So my assumption is, low marketing leads to low box office. But the movie will smash on stream on AppleTV+, because it is a good movie with a original story and a lot of twists which is the director's way of making fun. And I loved the very ending! Please more, Matthew! Hope you can go for Part 2 and Part 3. I will watch them, promise..","

It feels like watching a cartoon or kids film, makes me feel like whoever came up with the idea of making this film was just joking and then got pushed to do it so they just put anything together to get it out of the way. It reminds me of how my children do their school projects with no care, enthusiasm or diligence. It's so half baked that it's not enjoyable at all, don't waste your time with it.","

",flashsmt42,31-Jan-24,"The film starts off decently. Though as it progesses, it turns exhaustingly into a poor comedy. It tries to subvert expectations so often that it gets lost in itself and becomes a joke. Casting was great overall. It is good to see Henry Cavill in an espinoage role again. Sam Rockwell tries his best to play a humanized and casaul version of a spy. Bryce Dallas Howard does well with what she has to work with for the film. Though this shows that Vaughn should stick with Kingsman and it's R rating, instead of trying to expand the universe with this. The lack of practical stunts is also apparent right in the opening scene. We are spoiled with actors such as Tom Cruise doing things practically that it is easy to tell when CGI is being used. Overall it is a mediocre film that had potential, though wasted the talent of the cast.","

If you're a fan of the Kingsmen series, you're going to love this. Tom Holkenborg's score is on point per usual. I'll definitely be buying this when it comes out on digital.

Argylle," Matthew Vaughn could have been more involved in the final story for a better film.
",movieman6-413-929510,03-Feb-24,"Argylle is a new spy thriller directed by Matthew Vaughn, director of Kick-Ass, Kingsman: The Secret Service and X-Men: First class.Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a successful spy writer who leads a modest life despite her spy thrillers. Yet Elly's books seem to have an influence on real life, because when she learns that the events from her books seem to have really happened.When spy Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell) confronts her about this, she becomes involved in a real spy mission. Aidan and other hostile spies use her information to determine how to proceed in order to complete their missions for their own gain.Matthew Vaughn is known for his own unique action films. Here, in addition to his work as a director, he also became involved in these other films as a co-writer or producer. At Argylle, the writing work was left independently to Jason Fuchs, who has not previously worked independently on a film script. As a result, he ended up with a messy story that remains more on the long-winded side. Jason Fuchs tries to appear clever with a number of plot twists, but these are not always well developed, making the film more vague than really cleverly written.Matthew Vaughn or someone else would have been better off revisiting his final story. Later they could have stepped in where necessary. Then perhaps the final film could have been a little better.Matthew Vaughn himself describes the film as an ode to action films from the 80s such as Die Hard or Lethal Weapon. With such films, the final details were just looked at a little more closely. Furthermore, there are also some repetitive scenes in the film, which resemble scenes from other films by Matthew Vaughn.Matthew Vaughn is also known for his own style in terms of action scenes, but managed to portray them more believably in previous films. In this film, the visual effects are more noticeable, such as when characters are acting in front of a green screen.Despite the messy aspects of the film, Sam Rockwell manages to provide good and comedic acting. Together with Bryce Dallas Howard they know how to create good moments. Bryce Dallas Howard also provides good acting, but due to the weaker script she has to portray the role in different ways with her characters. Unfortunately, this sometimes remains more on the messy side. Other actors such as Henry Cavill, John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson, despite the film's promotion, play supporting roles in the film.","

Argylle," Very Exciting Action Film With A Lot Of Plot Twists.
",rannynm,06-Feb-24,"Argylle is a very exciting action film with a lot of plot twists. The high quality sound effects and background music are spectacular and terrific acting.The storyline follows a writer Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is seen at a reading for her new book, Argylle 4. At the reading we meet the key characters including Lagrange (Dua Lipa) and Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell) who is revealed to be a spy. After it is revealed that Elly has been writing about a super secret spy mission, things begin to get heated.Kudos to director Matthew Vaughn for delivering such an exciting film. The special effects really stand out, especially the sound effects which make it seem almost as if I was there. I also enjoyed the background music throughout the film. The music by Lorne Balfe creates suspenseful moments that kept me engaged with the movie. The best scene has to be when Aiden has to fight against the undercover spies on the train. We get to see how Elly interacts with the whole situation and, of course, there is amazing fight choreography. We notice how Argylle (Henry Cavill) is always alongside Elly and Aiden, but not in a way you might expect. Over the course of the film Elly is searching for the ending of her fifth book, but the plot completely changes throughout the movie.The film's message is to always remember who you are and this film delivers this message in a suspenseful way. It's important to note that this film contains a lot of fighting, blood and crazy action scenes.I give Argylle 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. It releases in theaters February 2, 2024. By Miguel C., KIDS FIRST!","

Argylle," It was really misleading and boring
",zeynepaydinoglu,06-Feb-24,"The initial impression conveyed by promotional materials for ""Argylle"" strongly suggested that Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa would feature prominently as the main characters. However, their limited screen time, particularly Lipa's brief appearance of only ten minutes, defied these expectations, leaving viewers with a somewhat misleading perception. It became evident that the narrative did not revolve around Cavill and Lipa as initially implied. The film lacked sustained excitement, with notable performances unable to compensate for weak script and direction. The plot lacked depth and failed to engage, while dialogue felt contrived. Direction suffered from uneven pacing and uninspired visuals. Despite commendable performances and high production values, ""Argylle"" disappointed, failing to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience.","

Silly camp action scenes and a funny cat - clearly all tongue in cheek, and a good concept. Then it all went downhill. They could've wrapped it up an hour sooner than they did - but instead went on to add several totally unnecessary twists which added nothing to the story. Everyone totally bored well before the end of the movie and hoping for it to end. It also took some of the funny style quirks from Kings Man and thought ""oh that was funny, if we do it more it'll be funnier"" - which of course it wasn't, it was a barely watchable cringe-fest.

",trevmonk,04-Feb-24,"If I was going to describe this film in one word it would be twisty, there are more than the fair share of ""gasp"" moments in the film.It seems every act has one which i found to be a little grating near the end of the movie after so many, regardless despite the shear number they all pay off I just feel they didn't need so many as the story moves along nicely anyway.The only other negative point on the film was the cgi and effect some of it is very cartoony and wasn't that well polished in places and looked cheap.With those points out the way the story is fun and a joy to see unfold. I'll be looking forward to the next installment in the MARV universe as their way of doing spy films is unique and fun.","

Argylle," Argylle
",jboothmillard,10-Feb-24,"The trailers for this movie looked really cool, from the big names in the cast to the entertaining plot, I was excited to see it, produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, Kingsman: The Secret Service). Basically, reserved spy novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the successful author of the Argylle book series, espionage novels featuring the secret agent Aubrey Argylle. She has almost finished her fifth book and is unsure how to end it; she often visualises the story and the adventures of title character Argylle (Henry Cavill). Elly, with her beloved cat Alfie (Chip, owned by director Vaughn and his supermodel wife, Claudia Schiffer) is on a train heading to visit her parents, Ruth (Catherine O'Hara) and Barry. During the journey, she is approached by Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell) who recognises her from the most recent Argylle book cover. Shortly after, a group of agents attempt to kill her, but he saves her and helps her to escape. In hiding and after shaving his beard, Aidan explains to Elly that he is a real secret agent who has gone rogue. He says that she has been targeted by a devious organisation called the Division who want her dead because her novels have seemingly predicted their future. Aidan travels with Elly to England, hoping that her next chapter will reveal how to stop the Division. Meanwhile, the Division, headed by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston), is trying to work out Elly's whereabouts. In London, Aidan and Elly search for a ""Masterkey"" that would help expose the organisation which she had also referenced in her novels. Elly hears a conversation Aidan is having and suspects he wants to kill her as well. In panic, she calls her parents for help. As they arrive, her father is revealed to be Ritter. Aidan reveals that they are operatives of the Division, and they try to kill her before they manage to escape again. Fleeing to France, Aidan takes Elly to meet former CIA deputy director Alfie Solomon (Samuel L. Jackson), seemingly whom she unintentionally named her cat after. They reveal that Argylle is not entirely fictional: Elly is in fact agent Rachel Kylle, ""Argylle"" was seemingly derived from ""R. Kylle"". She was captured and brainwashed by the Division five years ago, and made to believe that Ruth, aka Dr. Margaret Vogeler, and Director Ritter, were her parents. Her suppressed memories slowly manifested into her spy novels. In the latest Argylle novel, Elly was about to reveal the whereabouts of the Masterkey before her cover was blown. Elly, now Rachel and changing her hair colour from hinger to blonde, travels with Aidan to Arabia, where they retrieve the Masterkey. But they are soon cornered by the Division and are knocked out and taken to the Division's base. Ritter reveals that Rachel was a double agent and one of their most loyal assets. She offers to interrogate Aidan, subsequently shooting him, and she locates Alfie for them. But she reveals that she has betrayed the Division, she has in fact sent Alfie the Masterkey. Ritter stops the transmission, but Aidan has survived his gunshot and helps her to fight their way through the series of assassins. This includes a gun battle in corridors with colourful smoke and an oil spillage with Rachel skating across it mounting blades onto her boots as skates to kill more assassins. Ritter makes another attempt to kill them, but Alfie the cat scratches out his eyes, allowing Aidan to shoot him dead. It is revealed they are aboard the Division's ocean base. Vogeler appears and, using a music box tune and a code word to trigger a mental change, causes Rachel to try and kill Aidan. But Vogeler is killed by Keira (Ariana DeBose), a former CIA agent and Rachel and Aidan's partner who was thought to have died in a mission. Her experiences were seen in Elly's novels as her character, Wyatt (John Cena). After the download of the information to Alfie has been completed, the trio escape in a boat before Aidan detonates a bomb aboard the Division's ship. Returning to the persona of novelist Elly, Rachel publishes her final novel in the Argylle series. At a reading for an audience of fans, the real Argylle reveals himself, much to Rachel's shock and confusion. In a mid-credits scene, a young Aubrey Argylle (Louis Partridge) is in The King's Man pub; the first novel was based on his life as an agent. Also starring Dua Lipa as Lagrange, Richard E. Grant as Director Fowler, Rob Delaney as Deputy Director Powell, and Sofia Boutella as Saba Al-Badr. Howard is perfectly cast as the initially hesitant then kick-ass super-spy, Rockwell is likeable as the agent who guides her to help her memories return, Cavill in his suits and with a flattop haircut is cool as the imagined title spy, Cranston and O'Hara get their moments, and Chip is an adorable animal. It reminded me a lot of The Long Kiss Goodnight as the story unfolded, it is fair to say that the twists are a little mixed, and the overall plot is all over the place, but I just about went with it. The pop songs used (""Now and Then"" by The Beatles, ""Let's Dance"" by David Bowie) especially during the guns blazing sequences (""Run by Leona Lewis) are funny, the fights and chases are energetic, the fast-paced oil skating sequence being the highlight, the CGI effects might be shoddy at times, but for escapism and entertainment this is easy to settle into, a fun spy action comedy. Good!","

Argylle," More than expected
",frky_girl79,09-Feb-24,"Honestly, I was expecting an okay movie, I got so much more. I loved this movie. It was so over the top, with cheesy cgi, unplausable action sequences , a great cast and lots of laughs. You think it was bad cgi, I walked away feeling that they purposely used the cgi the way they did, they absolutely knew what they were doing with it and it works with the movie. It was not meant to blow your mind, it was meant to enhance the ridiculousness of the scenes!This was not a Bond or Mission Impossible movie, if you were expecting something like that, of course you were disappointed! Have you not seen a Sam Rockwell movie? Come on! Go in looking for fun, not a drama. Too colorful for you? You know what I'm talking about, you should have been laughing not rolling your eyes. 10/10, will watch again, will enjoy it just as much the next time!","

",iamyolanda-33660,18-Feb-24,"Critics are being really hard on this movie as they usually are. However the movie itself was very entertaining. It's been a long time since a movie has surprised me and this movie definitely did. Many plot twists and unexpected elements makes you ask ""what the hell is going on?"" in a good way. The cast was amazing especially of course the cat. Though there were quite a few plot elements, i think that it was executed in a comedic and smooth way. It reminded me a lot of ""Bullet Train"" with all of the plot twists and how if you missed 2 minutes of the film you would not know what the heck was going on for the rest of the film. Overall it was very fun and entertaining which we need more of in the industry.","

For those expecting a serious spy thriller you will be disappointed but for those who want a dumb but fun film you will love it. And boy is it fun! I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole movie. For me the star of the film is Sam Rockwell. He truly elevated the movie to a whole new level. His performance was superb full of quirkiness and little nuances. I also really loved the chemistry between him and Bryce Dallas Howard.

",nickfilmboy,15-Feb-24,Don't be fooled by the reviews that say this film is good silly fun. Johnny English was good silly fun this is just a confused mess. I wasn't expecting Argylle to be film of the year but my word is this poor.This film is yet another example in a worrying trend of movie by committee. If cinema is to survive the people who are pressing go on productions like this need to be offered a way out of the industry. This film is so bad it is damaging to future audiences. How someone can sign off on the huge budget for this film and then be proud of their actions is beyond me.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone over ten years old. Honestly you would be better watching a series of Peppa Pig.I wasted my time and money on this and strongly advise you not to make the same mistake.,"

Argylle," A Great Cast Does Not A Great Movie Make
",TMAuthor23,05-Feb-24,"I'm a huge fan of Sam Rockwell's work, and a big fan of Cavill (Superman, The Witcher) and Bruce Dallas Howard (The Help); but Dua Lipa...great singer, actress? Not so much. Boutella and Cena are wasted. Which isn't their fault. Everyone in this movie is swimming upstream against the heavy current of a terrible script, cringe worthy dialogue and surprisingly ($200 M budget) awful CGI.But the film? This movie that was hyped for months? It's bad. Real bad.Despite all the established stars in this train wreck (Samuel Jackson, Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, Bryce Dallas Howard...) ask yourself this...what would a movie directed by Jon Favreau, starring Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, and Clancy Brown (and many other well known actors of merit) look like, and how could it possibly fail? Then realize that movie was...Cowboys And Aliens. A stinker if ever there was one.That's this movie too.The screen is filled with lots of talent, but not behind the camera and not in the script. Fueled by a (wrong) viral story that the book it's based on was written by Taylor Swift, this dumpster fire gathered a lot of buzz before it opened. Undeserved, whether Ms. Swift ever writes a book, or not.If you want more entertainment than the movie provides, go read the ten star reviews (even the ones that only review this movie, because, you know, bots and clones are real).You're welcome.And to the casual trolls and their ""unhelpful"" votes, go read the Twilight series again. This movie is on par with that travesty of literature.","

I think people are being too hard on it. Yes, story holes but most do now a days, this one makes up for it in over the top craziness. Great play/ spin on spy movies and traditional leads.

It really shows in this movie but there's no doubt the big names still add a touch of class to the production. And we all get to benefit by going along for the ride.Bryce Dallas Howard was just as stunning as she was quirky, Sam Rockwell was just as funny as he is charming.And the plot although holier than a swiss cheese (which of course it's supposed to be) it still has enough twists to keep it interesting.A great one for date night if you're a bit of a fan of the fun and quirky.

Argylle," A neutered action spy (comedy?)
",scottishgeekguy,02-Feb-24,"Feels like they started showing the trailers for this movie legit like a year ago....And a year ago I was pretty excited for argyle....Now that I've seen it.....? Not so much..Matthew Vaughans latest is kinda familiar territory for him.... Action spy comedy vibes..... With a pop star cameo thrown on for good measure.Argylle tells the story of Elly Conway (played by Bryce Dallas Howard). Elly is a successful writer of spy novels, and she's on her 5th (I think book)The lead character in her novels is Agent Argyle (who, in her mind, is played by Henry Cavill)She's plunged into the real world of International espionage when she meets real life spy Aiden (sam Rockwell) who comes to her rescue when a bunch of goons try to kill her.He explains the bad guys are after her cos her books are actually so good and realistic, they've started to predict / parallel some real world spy stuff ....And thus... The plot kicks off and into high gear....All of that is pretty much covered in the trailer so no spoilers there..There IS more to the story and there's a couple twists which I genuinely didn't see coming so that's always a good thing...All of the cast are grest, Bryce is great, Sam Rockwell is great (when is he not) Henry cavil, John cena...
There's not a weak link in the cast.Like most Matthew Vaughan movies the action is also really good... Theres some grest action set pieces (one involving a slick oil filled floor that... While great.... Is a bit of a rip off of the first transporter movie.)The general story is good also,So... Why I'm I not super excited to talk about this one....Well.... The pace... And the overall length....It's easily 20 - 30 mins too long....The first act is great... But after that the pace takes a big hit......and it never fully recovers
(the person sitting to my left (you know who you ate) actually fell asleep during the movie.... And this was a 520pm showing...!)And if you've managed to not fall asleep during this review, a wee sub to the channel would much appreciated 😊)Apple TV aspect...It's apple TV original... Which means 2 things..1. There's some pretty blatant apple product placement... Not QUITE enough to majorly distracting..... But its there.....2. It will be available to watch on apple TV at some point in the near future....Now.... Does the fact that this will be on apple TV mean less people will pay to watch it in the cinema.?Honestly not sure on this one.... I went to a 5.30pm showing...on opening day (Thurs) Fairly big screen.... And I think there was a total of maybe 10 people in there....Same with Killers of the flower moon never saw it at the cinema.... Just didn't get around to it.... But I did think to myself.... It's OK I'll catch it on apple tv🤔Is this a good thing for movies.... For cinema...?So gonna go with 5/10 for this one....I'm fan of the director... I like all the actors.... But this movie just doesn't cut it..
. It never recovers from that post 1st act slump.","

Argylle," Our guile?
",southdavid,06-Feb-24,"Wow, some people really went for this one didn't they!Whilst I too didn't think that ""Argylle"" was good, it's also not quite the one-star abomination I've seen in some other places. I should also say that I went into this film having inadvertently had a rather large aspect of the films twisty plot revealed to me, so I can't say whether the film would have worked better had I not known it.Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a writer, who has found success writing about a secret agent Argylle (Henry Cavill) battling against ""The Division"". With her next book due, Conway is travelling by train where she's saved from an attempt on her life by Aiden (Sam Rockwell) a real-life intelligence officer. It transpires that Conway's books have been close to the truth and now a shady agency is targeting her believing that the resolution of a plot point in her story, could help them remain in the shadows.I have to say that I didn't particularly dislike the meta story within a story way that the plot of Argylle is revealed. I'm going to be careful with what I say, from here on out - as the film requests you keep its' secrets and I'm going to honour that. I will say, as it's in the trailer, that there are times you see Conway's story, on screen, performed by Cavill, Cena and Dua Lipa, for example, but then elements are rewritten on the fly as Conway struggles to complete the book and are reperformed. There is then a feedback loop of the novel feeding the story and round. I do think it ultimately collapses under the weight of all this, but, as I say, that wasn't my real problem. I will say that the mid-credits scene only worsens this issue though, but that's all I'll say.No, my problems were that I didn't think that Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell had any real chemistry together - I like both of them, just not in these roles, or not together at any rate. There are two signature action scenes, both of which follow each other leading into the film's conclusion (I'm really staying away from spoilers, so I'll call them 'skating' and 'smoke') that I felt came across as both CGI heavy and very pleased with themselves. Many of the supporting actors are playing characters that we've seen them do before, though none disgrace themselves. It's really really long and lacking in the sort of humour that a film needs to get through both the absurd nature of aspects of the story and that run time.I didn't hate it, it's not the worst film I've seen in 2024 so far - but it's not good and is going to have to do serious business for AppleTV if Vaughn is going to be allowed to make another one.","

Argylle," Entertaining but overstuffed
",stevencayer,07-Feb-24,"Matthew Vaughn has made some wild movies, such as the more recent KINGSMAN movies. He has his own style; I'd almost say it's cartoony. His latest is ARGYLLE, a spy thriller with so many twists and turns it left me exhausted. It's about a famous author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) who writes about Agent Argylle, a fictional spy. When she meets Aiden (Sam Rockwell), an actual spy, she finds out that her books have actually come true. This movie is your typical wacky Vaughn film, cranked to 11. The first half is meant to give you many questions, and then second half just starts pelting you with answers nonstop, which could be fun for some people who like constant twists, but it was too much for me. It felt like the script was being written as it was being filmed, making drastic shifts in the story at certain points. If they stayed with the beginning plot throughout, it would've been better. One thing I did enjoy was Elly and Aiden's chemistry, great fun banter. Sam Rockwell can do no wrong. My problem was with the rest of the cast. It's like the filmmakers just made them to be in the trailer then bounce. Big names too: Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, John Cena, Ariana DeBose, and Samuel L. Jackson. Also, this could've been cut down to 2 hours long. I liked the fight scenes, but they would've been better if it was at least 14A. The thing I loved about the first KINGSMAN movie was the efficient brutality of the combat, especially in that church, I'll never forget that scene. ARGYLLE is pretty messy overall, with an ending that left me saying ""Huh."" There's also a mid-credit scene that just left me more confused. If you're a huge fan of Matthew Vaughn, you'll probably enjoy this. I'm just a little tired of his flair.","

Argylle," SILLY BUT ENGAGING...!
",masonfisk,14-Feb-24,"Matthew Vaughn's (the Kingsman trilogy) latest currently in theaters. Playing out like Romancing the Stone redux w/author Bryce Dallas Howard, feted creator of the titular character, a master spy, which has spawned a series of books & fans as her new book is about to drop. Unfortunately it's also gained the attention of a shadow government agency who wants to snatch her up since she seems to have some sort of foresight into what's going on in the world of spycraft which comes to pass when Oscar winner Sam Rockwell defends her from phalanx of assassins on a train which spurs on a worldwide trek to get to the bottom of finding a thumb drive w/all the answers. Vaughn, working on a script by Jason Fuchs, which is usually not the case since he usually tackles that role as well, really leans into the lunacy of the narrative which has ties to his Kingsman films (a bottle sports the logo of the Kentucky bourbon company intro'd in the second Kingsman film) which in lesser hands would go off the rails but Vaughn is so up to the task he can make an ice skating gambit on a sea of split oil look ravishing w/all the players especially a frumpy Howard coming to the fore as a bedraggled heroine.","

Argylle," The longer it goes, the worse it gets.
",ofdavel,14-Feb-24,"This movie had some serious promise, then Matthew Vaughn just kept going and going and going and going. This movie can be reduced by a good 45 minutes and still tell a great story. I expected, as in all spy movies, to have some elements of whimsical or exaggerated. This took everything to a new level. The CGI was terrible, there were too many twist and turns, Bryce Dallas Howard is not believable as a master spy Kung fu expert. I love her as an actress but just not believable. There were too many scenes that don't make sense either. They don't want to shoot because there is a fear of igniting the crude oil on the ground *slaps forehead*. I'm was assuming they were going with the whole ""shooting can cause a spark"" angel. Ok that's fine, but then they have her put knives on her shoes and skate around. They do realize that the blades skating around on the concrete will cause a definite spark right? And this is all within the last 45 minutes of the movie. Just ridiculous. The beginning of the movie is fine. It's funny, it has some well choreographed fight scenes, the story is making sense. Then Vaughn went wild and no one could stop him. Please wait til this comes out on a streaming service.","

Argylle," If you don't like to relax & have fun at the movies, then you'll hate this movie
",jmbush22,06-Feb-24,"A LOT of critics immediately want to compare this to Kingsman simply because it has the same director. And because Argylle is less serious & less traditionally James Bond-esk; it gets trashed.It is simply not being judged on its own merit. It is a fun, well-paced film that leaves you guessing till the very end AND that doesn't easily fit into one category. And that's the real problem small minded critics have with this movie. It is NOT Kingsman. It is NOT James Bind. But it's not supposed to be!!! But because critics can't think past what has already been done, they have nothing directly to compare it to. And critics HATE that! Once a film becomes successful, then critics who rely on the creativity of others, have a standard to compare everything else to.Well, Argylle isn't easily compared to other spy/action/comedy films.Is Argyle goofy at times? Yes! But not Airplane/Dumb&Dumber/Naked Gun goofy.It's goofy fun yet many of these moments are interlaced with novel action sequences.It challenges the silos that both critics and Hollywood brainwashed audiences want everything to fit into.Another reason why I know it's being panned is that the leads look like real people & not every camera angle is designed to avoid double chins & real woman hips. The film's inclusion of Henry Cavell's character is a reflection of the Hollywood's overly sleek non-relatable standard for movie spies.You know why spies are spies in the real world? Because they look more like Sam Rockwell than Henry Cavell. And it is so refreshing to see this reflected in a feature film.","

",subxerogravity,03-Feb-24,"Argyle shows me that director, Matthew Vaughn has a knack with silly spy-based action movies by making one that's...not up to speed.I went into this with high expectations, but the ride was too slow for the 4DX ticket i used to see this movie.Everything was there but nothing clicked. I've seen Sam Rockwell do better in the worse of movies and his chemistry with Bryce Dallas Howard was ineffective.The All-Star cast was ineffective as well. Argle has a bit of surrealism to it, used to fit in all the big names in this picture, but nothing was gelling like it was supposed to.Once the story of Argyle was completely unfolded the movie finally picked up the pace, but by then, I was done with it.Wait to stream it at home.","

Argylle," Terrible, but fun?
",spank_6,02-Feb-24,"I could kinda see what they were going for? Kind of? For a movie with such a big budget it certainly wasn't the CGI in action scenes or that woeful cat! Maybe they spent all their budget on the actors and Beatles rights? It seemed like they were going for the silly spy movie. Like a spoof spy movie with a twist. But then they took it too far (you'll know when you see the dance seen). Genuinely cringe worthy at parts but you'll laugh because the writing and scenes are so bad. On that note, the acting wasn't too bad! Sam Rockwell was great and the others did a good job. There were some funny moments and good action at the start, but that falls away quickly. My mates and I had a good laugh at how bad it was, so points for that and the good acting.","

Argylle," Long Kiss Goodnight, without...
",mungosmungo8694,16-Feb-24,"As I watched this movie, being a fan of the prior Kingsman movies, I thought that this would have a neat flare on the spy movie, like the Kingsman movies did. What I realized as I watched this movie, is that I have already seen it. It was written by Shane Black in the early 90's and was called, The Long Kiss Goodnight, which was significantly better. The only real differences are the visual style the movie goes for, and that she is made into an author instead of a mother. The amnesia, the mirror memory, the super killer skills, the ice skating, the information to recover, the twist. Its all from Long Kiss Goodnight, without any of the grit. Argylle is like the Saturday Morning Cartoon version of an idea that was much better back then. Interesting fact for both movies, they both failed at the box office.","

Argylle," Not Bad, But Has Flaws
",vengeance20,03-Feb-24,"So, I finally got to see this after seeing dozens of Trailers of this film. I wasn't expecting anything great from the film, but still went to see it because it looked good... plus because Dua Lipa was in it too!The film follows a reclusive author, Elly Conway, who writes best-selling espionage novels about a secret agent named Argylle who's on a mission to unravel a global spy syndicate! However, when the plots of her books start to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, the line between fiction & reality begin to blur & she finds herself on a real mission!I found the film to be not bad, it has some funny scenes, good action & a good handful of actors! The story is interesting & unique & the actors do a great job with their roles!The film is pretty overly long at a whopping 2 hours & 10 minutes! The pacing is seriously off too & doesn't help! There's scenes which could've been cut down or cut out as they either added nothing to the plot &/or held up the plot or dragged on for longer than need be!Also, the fact that the violence was cut down & neutered was also another downer along with the actors like John Cena, Dua Lipa & Henry Cavill being used too sparingly! There's some interesting action & of course eye candy with Dua Lipa especially!Overall, it's not bad, but not great either & could've been shorter, faster paced & had the actors being used more!5/10.","

",gwhite-99165,03-Feb-24,"Henry Cavill is normally enough to temp me in to watch any film but what is this Argylle all about ?Well what you get, as the trailers hint at, is a spoof spy hokum of the first order. Yes it is overblown, yes at times it is silly, but at the same time you find yourself finding it utterly gripping.They throw every spy trope known to man at you. There are more twists in it than in a bag of curly fries, and the stunt scenes are overblown and at times completely unrealistic. Yet, it is fabulous !Watch out for the fight scene played out to the soundtrack of Leona Lewis singing Run. It is so ridiculously magnificent I literally cried with joy !This is cinematic entertainment how it should be.Don't look for high brow plot lines, expect fun. It left me leaving the cinema feeling great and you can't ask for more than that.I can't wait for the next one.","

",jadaosborne-06033,01-Feb-24,"Bryce Dallas Howard was fabulous! Usually when there's a female character that's a bad ass and involved in fighting scenes it's this tiny sexy female with absolutely so curves and FINALLY they gave us what we so desperately needed! A women with a full women figure, she has curves and muscle. It made me so happy to see such a strong yet curvy, sexy and smart women in a leading role. Bryce Dallas Howard has done more for females and their self image than the barbie movie would ever. I mean every barbie in the movie was stick skinny like come on that's no realistic and the most commonly worn size in female clothing is size 12. But for this movie to be funny, action filled, and have an exciting story with a leading women who wasn't forced to loose half of their body weight just to appear like a stick was AMAZING! The scene where she does the splits whole shooting is so awesome and hot! You go girl!!!","

Argylle," Sometime a spy movie required great storyline by the writer.
",Mysterygeneration,19-Feb-24,"Vaughn is well-known for his enjoyment of action sequences. Their portrayal is so accurate it borders on impressionism. Probably a lot of people are dying, but at least in graceful ways.Then everything goes haywire.Everything about it. Everything about the tale, the characters, and the acting is blown away. Though not that we were strictly grounded in reality before, Vaughn and his ensemble have done a good job of treading carefully so far. But man, when things become broad, they get real broad, waving goodbye to any remnant of realism and leaving everything behind.Unfortunately. ""Argylle"" is a lot of fun when it is enjoyable. It's fun to watch Rockwell and Howard race around the globe, but only for a short while.","

Argylle," Goofy spy antics that is plenty of fun if nothing particularly brilliant
",ethanbresnett,14-Feb-24,"Argylle is a movie that should be taken seriously at your own peril. It is as goofy as hell and the level of goofiness won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you lean into there's fun to be had.That being said, if you remove some of this goofiness there's actually a pretty solid plot at the core of this movie. It has lots of momentum throughout and a few great twists. I do think that the dialogue and tropes are quite tired for the most part, but there are enough decently staged action sequences to break these up and give the film some pep when it needs it.Maybe the highlight of this film however is the incredible cast. Sure the movie isn't of a high enough calibre to get the most out of them, but a supporting cast of Samuel L Jackson, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Henry Cavill, Ariana De Bose etc, is not to sniffed at. Not to mention the fact that this is topped off by an always charismatic Bryce Dallas Howard and an always superb Sam Rockwell. With a lesser cast this film really would have suffered but they all manage to bring it back when it verges close to the brink.So if you are into the action comedy genre and like films that don't take themselves too seriously, then Argylle will appeal to you. The twists and turns and stellar cast provide just enough entertainment to make this a worthwhile watch.","

Argylle," Cats, spys, and fun
",nkeehr,04-Feb-24,"I loved this movie! Being a cat lover, I was already hooked before I even got through the trailer. The movie absolutely surpassed my expectations, however. It wasn't as graphic as a Kings Man movie, so I was surprised to learn it was in the same universe. The fighting and choreography was just as fun, though.Samuel L. Jackson did a superb jolly ol' character, per usual. My favorite part was seeing Bruce Dallas Howard in a role very unlike any of her previous ones. I thought she said she was retiring after Jurassic World? Nonetheless, this was a great movie to make an exception for. The twists within twists kept the movie interesting. Sam Rockwell dazzled us with his signature dance moves. The one setback was that Rockwell's character kept calling Howard's character ""kid"", yet they were supposed to be lovers. I found both actors to have strong chemistry with each other but the ""kid"" remarks ruined it a bit; it was too weird.The ""big number"" was so gorgeous and cool to watch. This movie is hokey and isn't shy about its cheekiness. Again, I'll say it was a very fun, entertaining 2 hours. I'm so excited to see a series of these characters.","

While a lot of them are pretty good and surprising, some of them just don't go well. I just have to say, I was laughing out loud. This movie is hillarious.

Argylle," Heads up, this is unintentionally spoiler territory, but this movie is very much to me a straight up catfish
",ryanv36,09-Feb-24,"I teetered back-and-forth with either a two or three. Because of Henry Cavill and John Cena, I was going to go with a three, but the fact that I will never on my own watch this movie again, and probably will never ever I can't give it a three. So this movie is long so much so that I actually checked my watch. If you're coming in because of Henry Cavill and John Cena, I'm here to disappoint you they are barely in the movie. Quite a few times this movie forgets to cross their Ts and dot their Is & at one point they even suspend belief. There is a section in the movie, where a character ice skates on oil. Honestly, at one point I wanted to walk out, but I was watching it with my grandmother, so I stuck it out. Like they take so long, answering their own problems within this movie that by the time they do you don't even care. The eventually get over the narrative that two warring spy organizations are fighting for the knowledge that an author has, because somehow the books that she writes actually depict and predict events in real time of them because that makes total sense. They do this by revealing that she was a brainwashed spy, who, after an accident was made to believe she was just an author and her stories were not stories they were her memories. That could work if after that revelation, she was a believable fighter but she's just not. She comes off as a female Sherlock Holmes a lot better than what they tried to do. Then after they play a part to gain some information , in a different country, they get kidnapped by the evil organization have to break out and when she starts to fight, she fights still with a dress on like a full on like gala gown, and it does not look good. Also, after they spend the final act trying to recover this master file for Sam Jackson's character I could be wrong on this but I'm 95% sure they never actually reveal what that does or what it is. And again I can't stress this enough. How the heck in the editing department, did the scene where she skates on oil get green lit??? That doesn't make any sense oil is slippery, but it's still on top of a metal floor. And a couple scenes before they have to get out of a armory where every person has their gun aimed at the door to kill them. The two spies come out with multicolor smoke bombs because for some reason they have at least five different color smoke bombs, and as they're shooting kicking swinging fighting, there's like a slow dance song that you would expect to see on like dancing with the stars and it's just weird. My mom and I were laughing but not for the right reason. Plus seconds before she skates on oil after being told, she can do it but probably hasn't done it in a very very long time she grabs like a bowie knife steps on it, somehow gets it to stick to her boot and magically skates on it and never falls.","

However, this movie is visually stunning, a lot of fun, and it's refreshingly original.Bryce Dallas Howard delivers an amazing emotional range and delivers. Sam Rockwell performance was also well done as he had some very creative action scenes.Even though their characters storyline is flawed to some regard, they do bring them to life in their own way.Don't let the poor reviews stop you from making your own decisions.

It was as if a 14 year old boy sat in detention and wrote a short story that lasted 2hrs15mins. I cannot believe that they paid for Sam Jackson and Henry Cavill. Truly a waste of talent.

I'm sure that she has read better scripts. I want my money back. They played with my time for 2:15mins. It should've gone straight to video. And Jason Fuchs needs to take a drug test.,NA
Argylle," Lighthearted spy movie that tries a bit too much
",aprilsfriendorin,12-Feb-24,"Are you a fan of Kingsman? This movie is basically the Walmart version of that. It's a fun-hearted spy movie, but unlike Kingsman, this movie doesn't seem to know what it is. It has too many flaws:1) Too many twists: It seems like every good movie has some sort of unexpected twist nowadays. When done well, twists are great. However, you can have too much of a good thing. This movie all over the place, trying a bit too hard to surprise you.2) Lack of identity: This movie is having an identity crisis. It starts out as a pretty typical spy movie- unrealistic, but grounded in reality. However, by act 3, it becomes something absolutely ridiculous. Which would be fine if it had established itself as a ridiculous, fantastical movie since the start, but it didn't. It should've picked a lane.Overall, fun enough movie, but nothing special. Something you play in the background or when you can't find anything better to watch.","

If I had to sun this movie up in a few words it'd be action, whimsical, and odd.It felt like a mix between John Wick, Fast and the Furious, and any Will Ferrel movie.The premise is pretty neat. An author is writing a spy novel that ends up being the key to what happens next in reality - or is it?Sam Rockwell did great in this film. He played his character wonderfully. The cat looked great in parts and other parts seemed like obvious CGI.

Originally think this is an original agent movie, but how come Dallas can write a real story? The twist that she was an agent was unpredictable (although how come she can be an agent with her body built?) but it is still reasonable. Her mum and dad come out are just the boss of the bad gang! The 2 scenes mentioned by director (smoky and skiing) are very fast and fun to watch! The outcome is a happy ending and agent R Gyle can finally be good with Sam.

Argylle," Vaughn's Eccentric sometimes messy Espionage Extravaganza_
",magadalwarmayur,03-Feb-24,"Matthew Vaughn's ""Argylle"" takes audiences on a wild ride through the realms of espionage with a daring departure from convention. While the film's relentless commitment to Vaughn's fantastical and cartoonish style provides a consistently clever and frequently funny experience, the relentless upping of the stakes threatens to disconnect the narrative from any tangible sense of reality.From the opening scenes, it's clear that Vaughn is unapologetically embracing a unique cinematic language. The world of ""Argylle"" is an extravagant playground where the boundaries of plausibility are stretched to their limits. Vaughn's refusal to adhere to the constraints of reality can be both a strength and a weakness. On one hand, it allows for a refreshing and unpredictable narrative, but on the other, it risks diminishing the impact of the unfolding events by constantly escalating the stakes.As the film progresses, the line between the fantastical and the absurd becomes increasingly blurred. The relentless pursuit of more outlandish scenarios might leave some viewers yearning for moments of groundedness to provide a sense of consequence. Vaughn's refusal to let the narrative breathe occasionally leads to a loss of emotional weight, as what should be high-stakes moments are overshadowed by the next over-the-top spectacle.Nevertheless, ""Argylle"" thrives on its sharp wit and clever writing. The screenplay, filled with snappy dialogue and unexpected twists, keeps the audience engaged and entertained. Vaughn's ability to inject humor into even the most intense moments creates a unique fusion of espionage and comedy. The film's pacing is brisk, and the twists and turns in the plot keep viewers guessing, ensuring that boredom never has a chance to set in.The ensemble cast, led by a charismatic performance from the lead, brings the exaggerated world of ""Argylle"" to life with infectious energy. The chemistry among the cast members adds an extra layer of enjoyment, making the characters and their outlandish escapades all the more endearing. Each actor fully embraces the absurdity of the narrative, enhancing the overall comedic and thrilling experience.""Argylle"" may not be everyone's cup of tea, especially for those seeking a more grounded and traditional spy thriller. However, for those willing to suspend disbelief and embark on a whimsical journey through espionage, it offers a unique and entertaining experience. Vaughn's signature style, coupled with the film's relentless humor and unpredictable narrative, makes ""Argylle"" a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre and those who appreciate Vaughn's audacious storytelling approach.","

Argylle," Well-crafted homage/pastiche which will age better than the reviews
",dmerhodes,02-Feb-24,"I'm nearly 60, so far from the demographic this is aimed at (teenage boys). I didn't go to see it because I'm a fan of Matthew Vaughn. I'm not. Kick-Ass was excellent, but I don't think I've seen anything else Vaughn's done. No, I went to see it because of the terrible reviews.While this isn't in the same league as Starship Troopers, that camp satire came to mind after I'd seen the film, largely because the reviewers of that film really misread it. And I think they've done the same with Argylle. In one or both 'versions' of events in Argylle, Vaughn trots out all the familiar cinematic or genre tropes, but subverts them, by either reversing them or pushing them to ridiculously extremes, while still delivering a satisfying, intentionally ridiculous, spy caper.The film gives a nod to both liberal and conservative fetishes, which the two-track meta narrative allows: black good guys, normal(ish) females, blatant homo-eroticism, etc., on the one side; hyper-femininity and masculinity, traditionalism, etc., on the other. But then the film refuses to tie everything up neatly in a bow for either tribe, so far as concerns cultural, social and political perspectives, at least. In that way, Vaughn refuses to pander to an audience of modern critics that just seems to want its particular prejudices reinforced.This emptiness is, I think, deliberately baked into the story itself. We just have goodies and baddies but there's literally no difference between them, except the audience's biases and expectations. Nothing is being fought for or against, characters switch sides, literally or according to audience expectations, and both sides behave in the same ways. We just root for one side because that's what humans do. We claim our view as objective and the other view as subjective.So, while not a classic - it just didn't deliver on the laugh-out-loud scale for me - it is far better than the critics allow. It's a fun, smart, well-acted, and visually excellent romp. As with Starship Troopers, contemporary critics have missed the point. We now seem to live in a world where a good review is based more on tribal allegiance: is the filmmaker one of us or one of them? Review accordingly.Anyway, I'm sure teenagers will love it. It seems to me that young people - the target audience, after all - are more willing to have their expectations challenged and transgressed than cultural critics, nowadays. It's a sad indictment of modern culture, and the reversal of the role of the cultural elites, that it is the critics who now expect their expectations to be fulfilled and audiences which are open to the new. If you're young, go and really enjoy it. If you're not so young, but open minded, I think you'll find plenty to like too.Argylle is a well-crafted homage/pastiche of just about every contemporary genre and style: even Bollywood. While cinematographically very much of its time, the film, in its refusal to pander to our schizophrenic zeitgeist, should age well.Much better than the reviews. Think pinot noir. Don't understand? Watch the film.","

Argylle," Dumb Fun
",mitchell5954,08-Feb-24,"Argylle is a film I was excited for. It's directed by the same guy who directed Kingsman. I enjoyed the first Kingsman movie. It also has a stellar cast attached to it. I'm a big fan of Henry Cavill. The last big spy movies he did were the Man from Uncle and Mission Impossible Fallout, which are both films I enjoy. I will admit, while the film isn't as good as I wanted it to be, I certainly didn't hate it like many critics did.The film has a great visual style. That's it's big saving grace. Which is to be expected from the director of Kingsman. The action is extremely ludicrous. The final climax especially is just nuts. But I remember the action in Kingsman being pretty over the top as well. Like I said the cast is really strong and everyone gives at least an entertaining performance. I will admit, there were a couple twists in here I genuinely didn't see coming.Do I wish the tone would be less uneven? Yeah. Are the characters extremely strong? Not particularly. But I was still engaged with them. Do I wish Henry Cavill and Samuel L. Jackson got a bit more to do? Sure. I also think some of the CGI was pretty noticeable. I also think the film goes on a bit long and throws one too many twists at you.Overall, I think Argylle is dumb fun. Is it one of the best spy movies out there? No. As far as Matthew Vaughn movies, I would put the first Kingsman movie over this. I would put Fallout and Man from Uncle above this too as far as good spy films with Henry Cavill in them. But I still had fun with the movie, so I can't hate it or even think it's that bad.","

Argylle," A bittersweet spy movie
",pedroquintaoo,06-Feb-24,"In a bold attempt to bring a breath of fresh air to the saturated espionage genre, this film strives to innovate, although not always successfully. Its merit lies in seeking a different approach in a sea of productions that often become clones of each other.Despite a narrative that takes its time to captivate and moments where sleep seems inevitable, the second act delivers an unpredictable twist that finally grabs the viewer's attention.Some moments stand out for their intensity and excellent editing, such as the train scene and the situation where the protagonists are confined in an apartment. However, the promises of breaking patterns never fully materialize, and the film ends up being just a two-hour entertainment, lacking the irreverence needed to truly stand out.Unfortunately, unnecessary confusion seems to dominate, turning the film into a mishmash of ideas that scatter in various directions but fail in execution. The talented cast is often underutilized in basic and uninspiring roles. Some choices, like the supposed imagination of Henry Cavill and John Cena's characters by the protagonist, don't quite convince. And there are cringeworthy moments, such as Cavill's appearance and certain sequences that simply don't work.In a bittersweet conclusion, this film tries to find its place in a competitive market but fails to leave a lasting impression, even with all its efforts to innovate and surprise.","

Argylle," Too much fun?
",Mrbigham13,04-Feb-24,"What we have here is a real solid attempt at action comedy. Unfortunately the comedy was more in the action itself and less in the dialogue. A solid cast puts together an entertaining film no doubt but man this was certainly all over the place.Sam Rockwell steals the show as always, being an Academy Award winning Ham with the always enjoyable dance moves. Cranston and O'Hara play a fun duo and even the pet cat hits the mark. Sadly Ron Howard's daughter Bryce is the weakest link (again). Cavill and Cena's limited screen time was even more enjoyable. She just simply isn't very convincing and the convoluted plot didn't do her any favors.The story flowed well but as time passes the action gets more and more insane it's simply comedic. The CGI is through the roof on this one and immediately front and center during the very first car chase!It's alright if you turn off your mind and try and enjoy yourself. It's surely a far cry from most of these actors true talents but maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.","

",chasingmuses,04-Feb-24,The cheesy corniness is over the top I couldn't stop laughing it was wonderful! I'm trying to avoid spoilers but the actors leaned into the cheese and I loved every minute. Do not go into this looking for a profound spy movie. Do go into it if you love movies that jump the shark and have over the top scenes with insane unrealistic action sequences that are just fun and corny but satisfying plot. And the lead real world spy plays his role with heart - totally charming & annoying (in a good way) simultaneously.Recommend this movie as a fun date movie with a lot of charm & corny cheesy action fun.,"

Argylle," Predictable ending, not funny, no chemistry
",kristybwall-48146,11-Feb-24,I was so excited to see this but was ultimately disappointed. I love these actors individually but they didn't work together. Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard had zero chemistry. SAM Rockwell's role could have been played by ANYONE else. He brought nothing to the role and their relationship wasnt believeable at all. They could've made better use of Henry Cavill and John Cena and I was able to predict the ending. The cat was totally not needed...a Maguffin used to tie the storylines together but could have been done through exposition dialogue. Not a big deal if I was watching this at home on the couch but not worth the matinee ticket price. They wasted too much time and money on the ice skating scene.,"

",uriah-61978,07-Feb-24,"I was interested from the trailer, but the actual film itself was very disappointing. It is VERY predictable, not in a fun way, and Bryce Dallas Howard is very unconvincing in her role as the film progresses, it was almost as if she was doing a comedy role when trying to come off as serious.Henry Cavil needs a better agent so he won't be involved in a film that barely gives him screen time, it's practically false advertisement.The plot meanders too much around one a very cartoony MacGuffin. And the greater plot by itself is not deserving of the over 2 hours run time. Too many silly ideas where it would have been better overall to slim it down. If I can get my money back I would. 3 stars just for Henry.","

It kept trying to drop plot twists one after the other which were just too absurd to accept. And after a while it got repetitive to the point of being annoying.It simply doesn't do anything new and does it worse than has already been done.The day after, I wondered if Apple kept nagging the director to make a Kingsman-like film, to the point he made a terrible script hoping for them to drop the idea... only to be told ""Awesome! Let's do this."".","

Matthew Vaughan has made some good movies in the past, but I definitely wouldn't consider this to be one of them.The plot is all over the place, and it has no idea what it wants to be. It's also way too long, half an hour at least. I enjoyed Sam Rockwell's performance enough but the rest of the cast seemed to struggle with the film's lack of good direction. I also wasn't keen on the overindulgence in CGI use. There were a couple of entertaining moments and it's got a solid soundtrack but there doesn't seem to be much good in the film. Fails as a comedy and as an action film.Ultimately while it had promise it fails to use absurdity to its advantage and is worth avoiding in my mind. Apparently there's going to be two sequels to this, hopefully they learn from their mistakes here!","

Argylle," Top tier with the story just as thrilling as the action
",jocabogdanovic,11-Feb-24,"I thought it was an insanely good movie. Suspense after suspense and though by the end I kind of forgot what they were after (or why), the journey there was really fun to watch - it is an action movie after all - and for an action movie, it has a rather complex storyline which kept me engaged. You'd expect the actions scenes to take all the glory but I thought the story was just as thrilling, if not more. Many twists but I didn't think it was too many.Some of my favorite quotes were:
""Regret for time wasted is wasting more time""
""A lion convinced she's a lamb""
""The greater the spy, the bigger the lie""

All been done before. With the star power this film has. Expected much more. I can't believe Henry Cavill would leave The Witcher to make such a boring low rate film. I would think he would be offered better roles. Maybe he and his agent are just not good at picking projects. To give another example the narrator says ""it would be worth it's weight in gold"" as they are panning to Henry closing a briefcase full of 3 large bars of gold. How thought provoking and original. I want my 2:10 of my life back. Better luck next time Henry. Maybe, you're not as talented as I thought.","

Argylle," A Messy, but Thoroughly Entertaining Spy Flick
",jaredkjacoby,04-Feb-24,"Writer Elly Conway is working on her fifth book in her Argylle novel series which is about a competent and dashing spy named Agent Argylle. Her mom offers to visit to help her brainstorm ideas for the ending, but Elly decides to take a train to her mom's house. However, Elly finds herself on a train full of spies, one of them being Aiden who protects her from all of the other passengers attacking them. Aiden helps Elly get out of harms way and shows her that what she writes in her books is connected to something real and sinister going on.Argylle is a movie full of twists and turns that slowly make the movie become more and more absurd. It starts off as a typical espionage adventure with some elements of The Lost City with an author out of her element for adventure. Then, it becomes increasingly zany with reveals left and right. While the movie is not an outright parody, the tone is definitely more comical than Matthew Vaughn's other work. Honestly, while the movie is insane and a bit bloated, I was never bored. In fact, once the plot kicked in, the runtime went by smoothly.Argylle for all its quirks is a very entertaining movie with a lot of flair. What I think this movie gets right is the zaniness of the story. There is hardly a beat here that makes sense, but the movie never takes itself too seriously. Some of the twists actually surprised me because they can come out of left field. It is nice to see a movie just relax and have fun with its premise.The cast is fantastic. They all know what movie they signed up for and they have a blast. Bryce Dallas Howard is great as Elly Conway. She embodies the stressed writer who can be savy, but her performance in the second half showed her chops for this kind of movie. Sam Rockwell is clearly having the time of his life here with how he plays as a spy. His introductory scene where he helps Elly escape shows his personality of a laid back spy. Howard and Rockwell work well together as their chemistry makes the pair more likable. They especially shine in the third act.While the leads are awesome, the supporting cast is mixed. A lot of the actors I was excited for ended up wasted. John Cena only has five minutes of screen time, Samuel L. Jackson doesn't get enough to do and Sofia Boutella only gets one scene. Henry Cavil makes for a cool spy character, but he doesn't get a whole lot to do because he is only a character in Elly's story. I know that there is a saying of small role and big impact, but I really wanted to see more of these guys. However, Bryan Cranston does a great job as the over-the-top bad guy. He hams up his role and it is always fun to see him deliver his lines. On the other hand, Catherine O'Hara stood out for me. Without spoiling the plot, She kills her roll and is pretty interesting. The cast is great, but some of them could have been used better.The visuals and cinematography are pretty good for the most part. Some of the CGI is noticeable, especially in the opening car chase which looks a bit cartoony, but for the most part, the movie looks solid. Since this movie is only PG-13 and not R, Matthew Vaughn finds a way to sprinkle his style in the action scenes with two in particular standing out... and those two scenes are awesome. It is rare for a movie like this to embrace its zaniness in its action scenes the way this one does. The two set pieces involving a dance and ice skating are some of the coolest action scenes I have seen in a while. They also scream Matthew Vaughn. Not all of the action scenes are amazing, but when it works, it works well. The cinematography is beautiful with some inspiring shots. One includes a shot of henchmen with the reflection of a spoon. That's creative. The costume design and makeup are both really fun to look at as are the set designs. The scene with Sofia Boutella's character is particularly striking. The musical score is nothing special, but the movie does make good use of the songs it has, especially the song Run by Snow Patrol.Overall, in spite of its messiness, I really Argylle. It could benefited from an R-rating and not all of the twists work, but I was never bored with this movie for even a second. Each scene, I was trying to guess what crazy turn would the story take next. I enjoy this kind of craziness to plots sometimes. I do feel that the reception this movie is getting is a little harsh. For my money, this movie is definitely worth checking out. Even with its slightly long run time, it never felt long.Stay through the credits.","

",antiebsons,09-Feb-24,"The movie doesn't stand up to any criticism whatsoever. I have never seen worse staging of fights and some dramatic moments, and the plot is nothing. A lot of irrelevant and ridiculously stupid plot twists, a banal idea and just a disgusting ending in the style of ""what will happen next?"". The film is 12+ so don't expect any interesting humor here either. You will laugh, except for the stupidity of what is happening. It is pointless to list all the movie bloopers of the picture, because there are so many of them that you will get tired of counting. All that happens on the screen can not be explained at all. Here you will see endless cartridges in a small gun, as well as a burnt-out apartment, which looks like an ordinary one. Just one big stupidity.The only thing that pleased me was the soundtrack and partly the filming. All the rest does not deserve any attention at all.","

Argylle," A movie that never believes it can be good
",apereztenessa-1,18-Feb-24,"Some people are defending Argylle on the old theme of ""it's brainless stuff, and it kept me entertained for 2 hours"". That is somewhat true, but too low of a bar.The reality is the first 15 minutes of the movie are almost intriguing, in particular as the character of Elly Conway is introduced, but it only goes down from there, and progresses slowly towards scenes that are increasingly bad until they become embarrassing by the end of the movie. The casting of the movie doesn't help. Dallas Bryce Howard is not credible as a former super spy. Sam Rockwell is supposed to be funny as a non-glamorous spy, but ends-up just being non-glamorous. And Henry Cavill seems to be there to show that he is not fit to play any role beyond Superman, at least not in this century.Overall, the movie seems never to believe that it can be good, and tries to over-compensate by multiplying the plot twists. But all of them cannot fix the unoriginal plot, flat dialogue and more than anything the ridiculous cast.By far the most intriguing part of Argylle is the possibility that Louis Partridge may play a role in a future installment of the series. He has charisma and would make for a great young spy. Maybe that movie will be better?","

Argylle," Vaughn Strikes Again!
",cutie7,19-Feb-24,"Surprise, surprise, I really loved ""Argylle""! At first glance, I thought, ""Oh great, another spy flick we've seen a million times before,"" but boy, was I wrong! This movie is like a rollercoaster ride through a maze of espionage and absurdity, and I had an absolute blast from start to finish.Elly Conway, our protagonist, is the epitome of introverted; she's practically married to her cozy home and her cat, Alfie. But when her fictional spy plots start coming to life around her, she's catapulted into a world of stylish fighting scenes and high-stakes intrigue. And let me tell you, those fighting scenes are *chef's kiss* perfection! Matthew Vaughn knows how to choreograph action sequences that make you want to jump out of your seat and join them.What really sets ""Argylle"" apart is its refusal to take itself too seriously. Sure, there are spies, there are villains, there are plot twists galore, but there's also a healthy dose of self-awareness and humor that keeps the whole thing feeling fresh. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, BAM! Another plot twist smacks you in the face like a wet fish, and you're left scrambling to catch up.And can we talk about those twists? I won't spoil anything, but let's just say, my jaw hit the floor more times than I'd like to admit. It's like Vaughn and the writers took every spy movie cliché and flipped it on its head, leaving me grinning like a maniac the whole time.But perhaps the real star of the show is Matthew Vaughn's signature manic energy. The pacing is relentless, the dialogue crackles with wit, and the whole thing feels like a wild ride through his imagination. If you've ever seen a Vaughn film, you'll know exactly what I mean, and ""Argylle"" is no exception.So, if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that'll keep you on the edge of your seat with great stylish fighting scenes, ""Argylle"" is the perfect pick. Just be prepared to have your expectations blown out of the water, and maybe bring a spare pair of underwear for those plot twist-induced shocks. Trust me, you won't regret it.","

Argylle," The film's charm starts to unravel as it succumbs to the weight of its own convolutions and an indulgent runtime that overstays its welcome.
",jaysonpajaronvistal,18-Feb-24,"Argylle is a new spy movie that tries to stand out by being fun and full of action from the start. Sadly, it gets too complicated and drags on longer than it should, which spoils the fun. The movie kicks off with a lot of excitement, showing us the main character, Argylle, who's cool and confident, getting through tricky situations and risky moves with ease. But as the story gets more complex, the movie begins to lose steam.What starts as an enjoyable spy flick starts to feel like hard work as the plot gets too twisted and confusing. The humor and the cool action that we liked at first don't hit the same when the story gets more and more mixed up. Even the big action parts start to feel like too much, especially a car chase in the middle of the movie that just keeps going and going. It's these parts where the movie feels stuffed and could have used some cutting down to keep the excitement alive.One of the biggest problems with Argylle is that it thinks viewers will be okay with a story that doesn't make much sense. The twists in the movie, instead of making it better, often seem fake and leave us wondering what's going on. Characters make decisions that defy logic, and the plot twists, which are presumably intended to shock and awe, instead evoke a sense of bewilderment at their sheer randomness.On top of that, the movie tries to be funny, but sometimes the jokes don't match the dangerous situations the characters are in. This makes it hard to tell if the movie is trying to make fun of spy movies or if it's trying to be a serious spy movie itself. In the end, when the movie should be wrapping things up neatly, it just makes things more muddled. The big final battle, which should have been the best part, falls flat because the movie already went overboard with too many other scenes, leaving us more tired than excited.To sum it up, Argylle could have been a cool new spy movie, but it's let down because it didn't cut out the unnecessary parts and didn't stay focused. It would have been much better if it was shorter and got to the point more. As it is, Argylle shows that sometimes, keeping things simple is the best way to go.","

There's moments during the opening sequence that's dumb and ridiculous and you just have to roll with it. There's a sequence towards the end of the movie that's absolutely ridiculous but it's also a little funny don't know how to feel about that. Things are bonkers in this movie and not in a good way. A scene with oil and skating and knives that's probably the worse part of the film. Also cgi cat, the chi the cat sometimes just for fun like things that 100% they could have just had the cat do, but maybe the cat couldn't or didn't want too either way, way too much chi with him. Speaking of the cgi a lot of its bad and its terrible seeing a 200 million dollar movie have bad cgi. It's happening way too often nowadays. Now this movie is not a stinker so many critics are gong in on it. I don't think this movie is terrible. One thing i liked is the twists happen a lot and they keep on coming. Bad part about the twist is sometimes they are so extreme that they didn't really land to me like they weren't executed properly. Feels like you're watching somebody's crazy dream for 2 and half hours. I did like some action and some moments. I liked Bryce in this and I liked Sam a lot. Towards the beginning of the movie it feels like he's the only life in the film. This movie is not great but not bad to me either. Go in with a clear mind and no expectations. I went in thinking you know what it's gonna be better than critics are saying and it's gonna be fun....and I guess that only helped a little because I think it's only a little better than what the critics are saying,lol, have a good day God bless.","

The photography was great as was the acting. I loved the script. I liked both worlds the character lived in.I laughed out loud several times. The good guys won instead evil having its day.

From the action sequences they stole from Mr & Mrs Smith with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and the Kingsman: The Secret Service with Taron Egerton and Samuel L Jackson. I think they need to give some producer credit to Jackson, besides Matthew Vaughn who directed Argylle. I also smell a tinge of action from SPY with Melissa McCarthy.

The actors are alight, the cast is quite impressive for a movie based on a book that just came out. I was more confused when I left than when I entered, but the group of us had a good time.

Argylle," Fun to watch
",axeman_z,04-Feb-24,"After seeing this movie I can better understand all the weak reviews and seemingly weak box office performance. Let's just say this up front, the movie is fun to watch. I think the two lead actors were really weak for the roles but they did a good enough job. I think the sound editing needed a lot of work because I was in a theater with excellent speakers and while the voices could be heard clearly all of the music sounded like it was mono. I think the movie was too damn long. This wouldn't be a problem if you didn't figure out what the secret reveal for the plot was halfway through the movie, and trust me you will. Towards the end it literally became a series of very similar scenes you've scene in far better action flicks. Again it was fun to watch their take on some of those scenes but it gets old really fast. It was clear they took Apple's money and said let's keep making more movie instead of wrapping it up sooner and making a better movie. Also, this isn't a spoiler, this movie seems to directly tie into an existing movie franchise. I did not see that coming. To sum it up, fun movie that borrows plot devices and in some cases very similar action sequences from other movies. This is not a movie worth watching again but it's worth one watch. The best damn parts of the movie were the scenes with Henry Cavill and John Cena, especially the cafe scene.","

On the silliness front, it delivered, and then some. But the film was advertised as a Henry Cavill vehicle. It is not. He's hardly in the movie. Instead we watch Bryce Dallas Howard do a buddy spy spoof with Sam Rockwell and a cute scottish fold cat, half CGI. The first half is half decent, action and comedy wise. Then the film start getting even sillier, to the point that the characters keep reminding the audience: ""yeah, we know it's silly; run with it."" By the end, I felt like I had been cheated of the Henry Cavill action film the trailer had sold me. 6.5 for some amusing moments, and the effort. +0.5 for the cat.","

",jdrendinell10,19-Feb-24,"I think the biggest trap people have fallen into over the last 5 years or so when it comes to movies is that if a movie doesn't have a chance to make a billion dollars or win a gluttony of awards then it's not worth the time of day, which is such a terrible way to view anything. If EVERY movie is supposed to be the best movie ever, then no movie would be the best movie ever. We need movies exactly like this that are somewhere between above average and good where we can go, get a popcorn, laugh a little, be a little surprised, and leave knowing it was a two hours well spent.This movie was perfectly ridiculous, with some of that standard Matthew Vaughn flair we know and love. It's an absolute homerun of a cast, littered with Oscar winners, nominees, and general fan favorites and it was clear to see that they had fun making the movie, and you probably will have the same amount of fun watching.

Action packed joy ride from start to finish with a lot of funny moments. This film has it all in relation to a spy/espionage movie, Sam Rockwell especially done a great job with his role and so did Henry Cavill and John Cena for the limited time they had. Main lead was a solid selection and filled the role of author turned spy extremely well. A solid 7/10 at best, certainly not perfect but it's not meant to be a serious watch.

However, the movie takes a sharp and sudden turn downhill the second they say that she is a spy. I understand that they were trying to make a plot twist, but it was so unbelievable, especially on top of all of the other plot twists. I genuinely felt like I was being raped with plot twists. I did not consent to the sheer volume of stupid plot twists, stupid action sequences (ice skating sequence, I'm talking about you...), and convenient cop outs (i.e. The cat saving the day, the fallen comrade surviving and returning in the cheesiest fashion). In all seriousness though, I understand the director's intentions for the movie, and that it's supposed to be ridiculous and cheesy, but it just was too much for me.

Somehow he just isn't quite right for the part of action star & comedy lead in Aryglle.There's a lack of chemistry between Rockwell & Howard that holds the film back.The usual soundtrack we all know & love in Vaughan's films also isn't quite right either.So all in all the film just isn't as polished as you'd expect from Mathew Vaughan.","

And I found myself thinking ""but this is a great, over the top, spy action comedy, what is not to love about that!"".Then midways, something happens, and the movie spirals into all kinds of problems.Firstly, it drags out for way, way, way too long. From fantastical action and good one liners it turns into a snore fest with redundant, lengthy scenes trying to establish some sense of emotional gravitas. Problem is, BDH has zero range, and became nothing but annoying and downright bad at what she was supposed to after.Secondly, it bacame clear that it was style over substance. Which I one hundred percent can support, if the style is cool, creative, innovative, fun, esthetically pleasing. It never fully was, and it never really committed, becoming a jigsaw of puzzle pieces forced together that really did not fit.Thirdly, under utilized actors. Lots of great small roles, none got to shine, and especially SLJ had one of his worst roles for years, mostly reduced to acting like an excited 5 yo in the end.In the end, the movie was somewhat saved by an always fun and excellent Sam Rockwell. And unfortunately dragged down massively by, I'm sincerely sorry to say, a typically bad BDH. Not often I say this but the casting director really picked the wrong main actress with this one.","

Add in a confusing story line and obvious CGI settings and the film is lost.The film has good actors but by and large they were wasted. Samuel L Jackson's character is pretty much a cameo of a cameo, and Bryan Cranston's character lacks the glint in the eyes that made Colin Firth's Harry Hart such a success in the original film series.Very disappointing overall.","

",Quinoa1984,26-Nov-23,"Sometimes I thought Saltburn had more bravura in the ""I Want the Ultimate GOTHIC Horror/Mansion Look"" direction department going on rather than a legitimately clever script (or that it thinks it has a more clever plot than it does), and at other times I thought the script had incredible lines for these very good actors and maybe the film was over-directed.... like, okay, we get it, Fennell, you want to make the most Bronte thing that the Brontes never could.It is, visually, mostly boldly realized as a piece of hard-R pop provocation that works more than it doesn't, despite its ending changing some perameters with the leads initial ambitions that are tough to swallow. I don't think it is that deep, whether it was trying to dig into thorny Class stuff (it's a more Personal-Obsessive chronicle than that) when practically everyone is a vampire or not, save, tellingly, for who Oliver actually comes from. Frankly, knowing it was inspired by Talented Mr Ripley going in did no favors by comparison (with a bit of, aside from coincidentally ""You"" season 4, Teorema oddly enough), like at a festival with nothing to go on this might have got to me a little more.However, even with the obvious influences and one particularly glaring story problem - or just with logic involving a cell phone (you know, genius manipulator kid, you can block a phone number or just turn it off) - this is a glorious showcase for Barry Keoghan to (again!) be an intensely, leering, uncomfortable and yet always in his way natural creepy little confusingly-big shlonged weirdo; he and (second time this month post Priscilla an alluring) Elordi have excellent chemistry, and I can't stress enough that, with actors, in particular a scene-stealing Allison Oliver as the f'd-up sister, Fennell has as strong a grasp on her caat and like how far to let Pike and Grant go and when to reel them in (that scene with the checkbook is wonderful).If you want meaty acting, this definitely has that (a new category: Acting Over Substance?), and when it tries to be funny it largely is, and while it doesn't stand out as one of the best of the year it is an entertaining film moment to moment. If you were expecting another round of sociological buckshot in your brain, it doesn't have as much substantive things to say as Promising Young Woman did.Dare I say it now... whatever you got planned for Joker, Barry: bring it.","

",ukgreek,25-Dec-23,"First, the good. All the actors were great, especially Rosamund Pike. Brilliant as always. The direction was good and the sets and scenery were outstanding. It clearly had some money behind it, and of course had that ambivalent Oxford charm going for it at the start.I didn't know much about it before I watched and thought it was going to be a boring, coming-of-age movie about a college student who was gay-before-graduation or something. Instead, it turned into an almost-current day Talented Mr. Ripley and I fail to see what the point was.I expect so much more from Emerald Fennell. Why on earth return to that tired trope of elite class homosexuality as a sign of hedonism? We are so beyond that, and so is she. Pike did have a line that indicated how they toyed with non-heteronormative sex, but otherwise it was just tired. Sure, there were a few moments where I laughed, but it didn't make fun of itself until the end, and too late. Ridiculously absurd to think the police wouldn't have caught on very quickly. That the movie is well over two hours just tells me Fennell didn't know how to wrap it up adequately. I can tell you, despite a vaguely interesting twist that's been done before, the plot is numbingly boring.","

Saltburn," Bemused by the end!
",MazzyMayhem-117-544511,01-Feb-24,"After the rave reviews and the fact this film is by the talented Emerald Fennell, I felt compelled to watch Saltburn. My son had warned me that it's a bit 'full on' in places, so I wasn't sure what to expect.The well known story of poor, ugly student meets rich, aristocratic, drop dead gorgeous student played out with no obvious clues to where it was all heading. The plot takes a turn when privileged Felix realises Ollie has been lying about his family and his life was nothing like he had claimed. Events unfold and by the end of the film we see that Ollie is a nasty piece of work and very manipulative.A great cast with particular applause going to Rosamund Pike's performance as Elspeth. I was just sad to see that the brilliant Ewen Mitchell had such a small role.All in all, an entertaining film with a twist at the end. There are some very weird moments (I am thinking of the bath) and Barry Keoghan doesn't mind flashing his twinkie, so I would think twice before watching it with your parents/children!","

Saltburn," Brideshead with a touch of Peter Greenaway a brilliant Emerald
",tm-sheehan,16-Nov-23,"My Review - Saltburn
My Rating 9/10
In selected Cinemas nowSaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress Emerald Fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance Promising Young Woman which starred her friend Carey Mulligan.Carey Mulligan only plays a cameo role in Saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of Poor Dear Pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.Carey Mulligan in an interview with Margo Robbie a co producer of Saltburn said that the role Emerald Fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. On reading the script Carey Mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear Pamela and Emerald agreed to her request .I'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of Lady Elspeth Catton played in the movie to perfection by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike.This movie in fact has four Oscar nominees in the cast Richard E. Grant, Barry Keoghan, Carey Mulligan and Rosamund Pike.It's no wonder to me that Emerald Fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, two British Academy Film Awards, one Screen Actors Guild Award, and nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards.One reviewer described this movie as a Promising Young Man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.My only regret with this movie is the fact that Emerald Fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
The magnificent cinematography by Linus Sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.I call this movie an Art House black comedy thriller if I had to describe it in a few words I think I would say it's Brideshead Revisited with the style of Peter Greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like The Draughtsman's Contract , Drowning by Numbers and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover .This wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . It may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.Not everyone will share my view but I adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.I couldn't help thinking of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited while watching Saltburn so after seeing the movie I wasn't surprised to read that Emerald Fennell recommended Jacob Elordi the Brisbane born handsome actor read Brideshead Revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .In complete contrast Jacob will be playing Elvis Presley in the forthcoming movie Pricilla based on the early relationship of Pricilla Beaulieu and Elvis .In Saltburn Jacob Elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection Felix Catton the son and heir of Sir James Catton played with delicious detachment by Richard E Grant and Elspeth Catton perfectly cast with the glamorous Rosamund Pike .Rosamund Pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by Sophie Canale who was assistant costume designer on Bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper Oliver Quick also played to perfection by the Academy Award nominated Irish supporting actor Barry Keoghan in The Banshees of Inisherin Barry Keoghan.Barry Keoghan's character Oliver Quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at Oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .His character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his Summer of love into a quest of betrayal.The movie begins with Oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic Felix Catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts Oliver's nerdy dullness . Oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of Felix Catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.Similar to Brideshead Felix invites Oliver to spend the Summer at his family's ancestral home Saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch Elspeth .No spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.As mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled Radcliffe Square in Oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.The stately home that Emerald Fennell chose as Saltburn is Drayton House in Northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
I haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were Archie Madekwe as the young border at Saltburn Farleigh Start who sees through Oliver Quick and becomes an object of jealousy.Also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household Annabelle played by Sadie Soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing Butler played by Paul Rhys are wonderful.I'd love to spend a day in Emerald Fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in Killing Eve ,Promising Young Woman and now Saltburn I find fascinating.","

Saltburn," Slow and predictable
",grantss,30-Dec-23,"Oliver Quick, an awkward, insular young man from the north of England arrives at Oxford University and struggles to fit in. However, his situation changes when he befriends Felix Catton, born into wealth and very popular. One summer holiday Felix invites Oliver to the family estate, Saltburn. Now Oliver will get to see how the upper class live.A film that had potential as an examination of class divides, and social differences in general, and also as a dark thriller. While there is some degree of both of these, it is quite the damp squib.The setup takes forever, with many scenes that really don't add any colour to the characters or flesh to the plot. Everything takes forever to develop when it could have been done more quickly and engagingly.After a point it is fairly obvious where everything is heading and when the main plot development arrives the aftermath is quite implausible (any further discussion would provide spoilers). Then, just to prove that the writers assume that the audience consists of morons, there is a huge ""look at how clever we are"" revelation scene which is hardly a revelation at all as that was what most of us knew or suspected all along.I was hoping for one more twist that would have redeemed the plot to a degree but that never came.Nothing to recommend about this film, ultimately. Don't waste your time on it.","

Saltburn makes zero sense, he wanted a friend and from the beginning someone tried to befriend but he ignores him and tries to befriend another only to destroy him and his family.I gave this movie a single star, because I went in blind, hoping for a nice entertaining story but came away positively disappointed and disgusted.

Saltburn," Derivative and a tremendous waste of acting talents.
",mikekisil,23-Nov-23,"It is a mistake to only compare this film with ""The Talented Mr Ripley"", when the obvious source is ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" starring Dennis Price and a tour-de-force from that acting genius, Alec Guinness. Murdering your way to the top of an aristocratic family in the way that Emerald Fennell has constructed it, is very twenty-first century because of the ending but it does not make snese. And that is the problem for me. The reviewing of previous events from a different perspective implies a cynicism and motive that does not fit the main character. So when it is presented, astute members of the audience are not going to view it as a twist but are more likely to think ""Hang on a minute, what about when....???"" So whose fault is that? Scriptwriter and director are the immediate culprits and here they are the one and only Emerald Fennell. Her Oscar for the ""Promising Young Woman"" may have been justified. I don't think she's going to get anything for this one unless the ""Razzies"" are stuck for choice.Just a note about Barry Keoghan and his performance . I wish I was a fly on the wall when his agent convinced him to a) be stark-naked and pretend to ""screw"" through the freshly-dug grave of a main character to highlight his obssession with said character and b) pretend to lick the porcelain floor of the bath where that obssession has just masturbated, (""Saw"" franchise please take note, if you want to push the boundaries of revulsion, check if Fennell is doing anything). As for Keoghan's agent.praise indeed because he must be the model for ""Entourage's"" Ari Gold !!","

Saltburn," loved it
",uvz-54425,01-Feb-24,"The movie was quite enjoyable, albeit slightly too ambitious. It seemed to struggle in balancing between an aristocratic setting, lacking the depth found in works like 'Brideshead Revisited' or Alan Hollinghurst's 'The Line of Beauty', and a psychological thriller aspect, which, while entertaining, came across as overly sensational and somewhat lacking in credibility. At times, the plot developments were so outlandish that they were more amusing than serious. Saltburn was on the verge of being a masterpiece with its wealth of excellent content. It's still a worthwhile watch, despite some superficial elements and a feeling that Fennell and the screenwriter didn't fully explore their characters, choosing sensationalism instead. Quick's portrayal of a sociopath was intriguing yet not entirely convincing, but the film was still an enjoyable experience overall. It has more strengths than weaknesses.","

",redwingsme,26-Nov-23,"If you're a film major you probably loved this movie. So much symbolism and it takes unexpected turns. But its ""shocking"" moments are so odd that ruin what could have otherwise been a good story. I'm sure some of these 10 out 10 ratings will call on the message of mental illness as thought provoking or other flowery symbolism that is unlike the typical hollywood movie. But I would avoid this if you are an average filmgoer. Especially those that just wants to see a movie that is entertaining and unique without leaving you feel like you just watched some screen writers most dismayed plot just to be edgy.There were a couple truly disgusting scenes of perversion that added no value to the story. Not to mention the holes in the plot. Holes like why would he go through the lengths that he took to infiltrate and take down the family members one by one? Oh, because he loved Felix so much....right. We find out that he set out to befriend Felix from the very start, but why? This would have made more sense if there was an actual motive other than he was unbalanced and just wanted to be loved. Save your time and money.","

",Dargumin,21-Nov-23,"This was awful. The characters were one dimensional, and it kept going long after the film felt ""done"". Whilst Oliver is obviously the bad guy, they could have still given him a smidge of likeability (eg Patrick Bateman) but literally there's nothing to like about him.Let's be honest, the film should end when Felix meets Olivers parents, there's no way he'd be allowed back in Saltburn after that. It then rushes through the 3rd act where the body count stacks up so quickly it doesn't have time to be impactful. The grave scene was utterly ridiculous, I felt embarrassed for everyone involved in the making of that scene, but yeah somehow it got made.Respect to the Music Supervisor though, some great choices including Bloc Party & Tomcraft. The 00s truly the last truly decent decade of music and cinema.","

Saltburn," Promising characterisation, but fails to deliver
",Ayupgeeza,19-Nov-23,"It doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. More or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, British version of The Talented Mr Ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.Having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.Our protagonist Oliver (Barry Keoghan) is a scholarship boy at Oxford. Initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich Felix (Jacob Elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. There he is introduced to the bizarre world of the British aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.Having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. We are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between Oliver and Felix's sister Venetia (Alison Oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.As a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.There are strong performances throughout the film - Rosamund Pike, as Felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. Jacob Elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a British aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. Richard E. Grant, as Felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.And there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. Pamela (Carey Mulligan) is a guest at Saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. Farleigh (Archie Madekwe) is Oliver's rival for Felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. This is particularly disappointing as Archie Madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.The final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. At 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and I confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema.","

Saltburn," Will take you to some places you didn't know you wanted to go
",jtindahouse,30-Sep-23,"Quick review: I loved Emerald Phannell's debut film 'Promising Young Woman'. It was hard to believe it was a debut feature. I hadn't even heard she was doing a follow-up film until suddenly I was watching it as the Secret Screening at Fantastic Fest. Needless to say it blew me away. This was a terrific film experience.I think the thing I love most about Phannell's work is the attention and care she gives to every character. There are no throwaway character's in these movies. Everyone has a purpose and every character is fascinating in their own way.When that's the case it can be hard to single out a particularly good character/performance, and really everyone here was worthy of mention, but in particular I have to bring up Rosamund Pike. She stole every scene she was in. Also Barry Keoghan is fast becoming the best actor working today. He is captivating to watch here.'Saltburn' was such a pleasant surprise. I loved every minute of it and would highly recommend it. Be warned though: this film is not afraid to go to some shocking places. 10/10.","

Saltburn," Bogus
",ferdinand1932,26-Dec-23,"Raymond Chandler remarked: The English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers.He could have said this about Saltburn where class consciousness is coded in the English DNA like nowhere else and furnishes enough material to retain funding, however threadbare it is.The themes of Saltburn are like pieces filched from Howard's End and Brideshead Revisited and no doubt other, lesser, books about country piles, as well as the 1930s detective novels that Chandler was referring to in his spiking of English writing.Class, real estate and sex could be the holy trinity of a certain type of English writing, lazy, dilettantish and effete. Add Oxford undergrads to the plot and the languorous destiny of the story is foreknown in the opening credits.With such worn material adding some spice is required and thus, drinking bodily fluids, instigating - or simulating - necrophilia through a meter of dirt on a grave, should supply the necessary frisson to an audience that could be comatose. These disingenuous tactics, however, do not dispel Chandler's remark of it being dull. Immeasurably so.Nor does the photographic eroticism of the demi-monde in the fields and the sunlight flaring in the lenses cover up the shallow sentiments displayed. Rather like the cliché parents of Saltburn, who talk like stock characters from a 1930s parlour play that ought to have been forgotten, these tropes should be in a theatrical and cinematic op-shop.But where it really falls over is the end which chooses facile plotting to provide some ending with its redundant ballet through the newly acquired pile; intended to show victorious power, though it comes across rather like Benjamin Field.A hollow, grubby, film which ought to have understood the motto at the beginning of Brideshead: Et in Arcadia ego.","

Saltburn," Fennell's nasty films depend on an absurdly dumb, easily duped set of victims
",210west,06-Jan-24,"Fennell's previous film, ""Promising Young Woman,"" was a hate fantasy about wreaking vengeance on a bunch of abusive guys (and one woman administrator) responsible for the death of the heroine's friend. As happens in such fantasies (and ONLY in such fantasies), every step of her plan went way too smoothly; the avenging heroine easily tricked all the men -- reducing them, one by one, to contrite weeping wimps -- and humiliated the woman administrator, leaving her crushed.The hate fantasy in this new film succeeds with even more implausible ease. A homely, inarticulate, lumpish nerd at Oxford is -- implausibly -- befriended by a tall, handsome, immensely wealthy fellow student who takes him home to his lavish, implausibly underpopulated country estate the size of Buckingham Palace, where his aristocrat family lives with what appears to be a single butler and two footmen (except at one point near the end, where a gaggle of servants we've never seen before suddenly appear). This family -- implausibly sappy, since the success of the comic-book plot depends on their being a bunch of absolute patsies -- takes the lumpish young visitor to its bosom, lavishing upon him a totally unbelievable degree of attention and affection.... whereupon, halfway through the movie, the inarticulate young visitor is suddenly revealed to be a smooth-talking, Machiavellian, diabolical psychopath who neatly -- did I mention implausibly? -- murders the family members, one by one, and in the end inherits the estate.So basically, the movie starts out as ""Brideshead Revisited,"" only cruder and ickier, and midway through turns into ""The Omen,"" only dumber.There's one original surprise involving the young man's return home. I didn't even recognize the wonderful actress Dorothy Atkinson as his mother. And Archie Madekwe is all too believable as the sort of arrogant, racially privileged type we don't often see depicted in today's media.","

Saltburn," happy castle dance
",ferguson-6,21-Nov-23,"Greetings again from the darkness. Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (2020). She's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. We are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of Barry Keoghan.Oliver Quick (Keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the Class of 2006 at Oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. He becomes transfixed on the BMOC, Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi, fresh off his turn as Elvis in PRISCILLA). Felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. Life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. He's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day Oliver helps him out of a jam. This leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. The first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to Felix inviting Oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... Saltburn.Saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. Felix's eccentric family includes Farleigh (Archie Madekwe, GRAN TURISMO), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow Oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; Venetia (Alison Oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; Sir James Catton (Richard E Grant), the childlike father; and Espeth Catton (Rosamund Pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. It's a motley crew that puts 'The Royal Tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.As the summer progresses, we see Oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. His non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. As viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with Oliver, yet director Fennell and Keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. Those hopes are dashed once we see Keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and Fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.The third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with Fennell and Oscar winning cinematographer Linus Sandgren (LA LA LAND) creating an Old World style within a contemporary world. The film is perfectly cast with Elordi quite magnetic as Felix, the not-so-obscure object of Oliver's desire. Madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting Farleigh, and Grant and Pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. Alison Oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while Keoghan nails the creepy Oliver (in line with his roles in THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER, and THE BATMAN. He has become the go-to psychopath. He even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY (1999) as its most obvious comparison. Ms. Fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.Opening in theaters on November 22, 2023.","

Saltburn," It succeeds if the point was only to portray clueless upper-class snobs
",steiner-sam,23-Dec-23,"It's a psychological drama about class and sanity set in 2006-2007, with something of an afterword maybe ten years later. It begins at Oxford University and ends on a massive estate in North Yorkshire, England. Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is a beginning student at Oxford. He's attending on a scholarship and admits his parents have addictions, and his mother also has mental health issues. Initially, he is socially stuck with Michael Gavey (Ewan Mitchell), another isolated scholarship student.Oliver wants to be part of the larger group of students from upper-class means, led by Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) and Felix's cousin, Farleigh (Archie Madekwe). Eventually, he breaks into the circle of nobs after a fortuitous incident with Felix. Class differences are apparent, but Oliver endures. After Oliver's father dies near the end of term, Felix invites Oliver to spend the summer at his parents' huge estate. There, he meets Felix's parents, Sir James (Richard E. Grant) and Elspeth (Rosamund Pike), and Felix's sister, Venetia (Alison Oliver). Other guests include Farleigh and Elspeth's friend, Pamela (Carey Mulligan).The film follows the summer's events as Oliver tries to penetrate the Catton world, facing particular resistance from Farleigh. Suddenly, we learn Oliver's story is not entirely accurate, and his passions lead to chaos within the Catton family.""Saltburn"" is touted as a dark comedy. For me, it was an incomplete drama whose ending came after almost no breadcrumbs providing clues along the way. The senior Cattons and guest Pamela were less darkly funny than supercilious and clueless. Archie Madekwe, a secondary character, gives the most authentic performance. It succeeds if the point was only to portray clueless upper-class snobs, but the script could have used a lot of work.","

",gsygsy,06-Nov-23,"There's a lot to enjoy in this movie. It's well-paced, beautifully presented in terms of production design and cinematography, Barry Keoghan in dazzling in the leading role, and he is well supported by, among others, Jacob Elordi. Archie Madekwe, Alison Oliver and Richard E. Grant. Rosamund Pike, putting her essential chilliness to good use, is surprisingly amusing. But there are few other surprises as we tread through the familiar world of the English upper class and its pampered progeny. Taking a sort of semi-critical stance, writer-director Emerald Fennell summons up the memory of a number of films that examine the British class system. Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Servant, The Go-Between, The Hireling...I even caught a whiff of the very obsure American film Black Flowers for the Bride. I can't work out whether or not Ms Fennell thought she was on to something new. If she did think so, she was clearly mistaken.","

Saltburn," Subpar Blatant Forgery of Brideshead Revisited
",thalassafischer,22-Dec-23,"Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh is one of my favorite novels, and I've seen both the 2008 film as well as the 1980s BBC mini-series, so I immediately recognized Saltburn was Brideshead ""updated"" for the 21st century just from seeing the trailers. I waited for it to come on streaming because I was curious but not optimistic. While stylish and peppered with memorable 2000s music for Millennials in the first half of the film, the second half of the film is just gross on purpose. Something about a bathtub drain, I actually had to turn down the volume on my device because I didn't want to hear the nasty slurping sounds of some dork tonguing a dirty plumbing pipe, and it just gets worse not ten minutes later with the clueless virgin Oliver taking advantage of Felix's emotionally unstable sister Venetia hours after a tete-a-tete with her narcissistic mother.Saltburn tries too hard and just ends up playing victim to a sub-generation of people who have mistaken shock value for something intelligent to say. In the original Brideshead Revisited, complex moral questions are visited and there's an emphasis on something other than sex (though it is a racy book for the early 20th century era it was published). Also, Felix is no match for the charismatic and childishly fey Lord Sebastian Flyte.Don't be in a rush to see this one.","

Saltburn," Barry Keoghan is So Watchable
",tkdlifemagazine,12-Jan-24,"Wow. There is no person more adept at playing the quirky, odd, and, downright, nefarious than Barry Keoghan. He made a huge impression in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and this performance is no less disturbing. He is masterful as the poor, private school loner that befriends a rich, likable classmate from a noted and affluent family in England. This movie is rich with bizarre and eccentric characters, fluid sexuality, and dreamlike sequences. As this story unfolds we learn that Oliver Quick is not who he appears and purports to be. This is highly watchable and very fun and somewhat painful to watch at parts. I highly recommend it.","

Saltburn," Deliciously wicked
",RahulM007,22-Nov-23,"He is just ""a human boy"".Emerald Fennell's ""Saltburn"" is an unforgettable, irresistible cinematic experience showcasing Barry Keoghan in his prime. Barry Keoghan gave not only his best but a career defining performance that will be remembered for years to come. The final scene of him will be seared in my brain for the foreseeable future (might even be forever). I adore Emerald Fennell's signature style, and after her directorial debut ""Promising Young Woman"" in 2020, I was eager to see what she comes up with next. ""Saltburn"" absolutely delivered the thrills, laughs, weirdness, sexiness, eeriness, and stylish personality that the first film encompasses but double downs on it tenfold. It is a very British psychological thriller with plenty of charm, youthful energy, and originality. The early 2000s aesthetic is lush and on point. I truly believe that this film utilizes the so-called 'eat the rich' narrative perfectly, and is easily the best film of that genre. The film is kind of a cross between Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" and Mike White's ""The White Lotus"". I need the film's soundtrack like yesterday. I have nothing but undying respect, gratitude, and praise for filmmaker Emerald Fennell. ""Saltburn"" is one of the best films of the year. Bravo to all involved, especially Emerald Fennell and Barry Keoghan.*At one point in the movie, Felix (Jacob Elordi) says what everyone is thinking: ""I'm so effing hot."" If Jacob Elordi showed even the slightest interest in me, I too would be driven mad with love.Final verdict: 10/10.","

",loveglow101,30-Dec-23,"My five star rating of this movie is generous. Am my opinion. This is an attempt to remake in a modern way, the talented Mr. Ripley. Which happens to be one of my favorite movies. I realize this early on in the movie and I hoped that they would've pulled it off better than they did. But they didn't! You are better spending your time watching the talented Mr. Ripley. In that movie you at least get to be tuned in to Matt Damon's deceit and the world response around him. Here you are left to use your imagination and assume until the end. Which tries to be a , gotcha reveal but fails. It is a beautiful film however.","

",superfox_888,11-Jan-24,"It's been 24 hours since I saw this film, and I can't stop thinking about it. Loved it! I want to watch it again to catch all the things I missed the first time.This story has been told before, with varying degrees of success. I got strong Brideshead Revisited vibes, and completely agree with another review saying the film is the lovechild of The Talented Mr Ripley and Call Me By Your Name.This version is exquisitely shot, although at times I found the dialogue a little clunky. The close ups of Barry felt jarring, but that's the whole point. I found myself strangely fixated on Oliver as he became more fixated on Felix and his family. At first, I thought there weren't any layers to peel back, to unpack the story, but the more I think about it, the more layered the performances are. Definitely requires a rewatch!I'd recommend this if you liked Midsommar, or feel like a disturbing story where the viewer is the voyeur.

Weak performances, feeble direction, and bad writing contribute to an overall lackluster experience. The screenplay struggles to salvage the production but proves to be one of its weakest links.Despite hopeful elements, the film ultimately disappoints, with its only notable aspect being its significant failure.

As in, ""That movie was excruciatingly bad - I was totally Saltburned."" This movie may be one of the greatest disappointments in the history of cinema. It starts out OK but steadily and inexorably devolves into a grotesque mess. Set in Oxford University, an awkward and shy student, arrives for his first year. Instead of making real friends he leeches onto one of the most popular students. His adoration for his new ""friend"" takes us on a depressing ride into depravity and evil. I see no redeeming qualities. Hollywood, as we once knew it, is gone.","

Saltburn," Saltburn? How about Slowburn? REAL Dlow
",mjanelle-24974,25-Nov-23,"I love Emerald Fennell, so I was especially looking forward to this movie. Granted it doesn't start out badly. Starting with a talking head interview type monologue and then merging into the ""scholarship student"" thrown into upper crust society, homoerotic outsider looking yearningly towards his object of desire we've seen in so many Merchant Ivory movies. And the. It sits there for 30 minutes or so. Not moving. Then we're brought to the elitist estate with the big windows and mirrors and grounds with a maze (don't get lost, is the marketing tagline). The object of desire (and heir apparent) gives his summer friend an irreverent tour of the place. And then you realize they will sleep in adjoining rooms that share a bathroom (if that's OK) and we thing, well, this might be interesting. But no. We spend the next hour learning. Banalities about this family. But not even banal enough for us to begin to hate them. They're just sad. We know this story. There's some Teorema like encounters with different members of the (sometimes extended) family (some of you will get it) that might have also been interesting had they been explored. But no. When people start dying you think it's going to FINALLY get interesting. But no. It's handled with the same banality of the rest of the movie. And the payoff (with gratuitous nudity) you figured out about 30 minutes before. We want it to be about revenge, unrequited love (I can't have you so no one can), ambition, need for family. But it turns out to be just about greed. But even that payoff feels shortchanged.","

To call this pretentious nonsense is really an understatement.Similarly, to simply call it derivative is an understatement. There really is nothing, and I mean nothing, truly original in the concept or in the depiction.The writing and direction are very pedestrian indeed, but it appears that that was not very relevant to the creators.

",classicsoncall,02-Jan-24,"Movie critic Rex Reed calls ""Saltburn"" a film of staggering impact. I would agree, except he meant it in a positive vein, and I see it as just the opposite. It was decadent, disturbing, disgusting, demented, depraved and dysfunctional. I don't think there are enough d's in the dictionary to fully describe my reaction to it. There are two scenes in particular that challenge the viewer not to gag on the spot, and without describing them, I think you'll easily figure them out if you watch the picture. That's not to say you should watch the picture; I didn't find it to have any redeeming entertainment value. Principal actor Barry Keoghan does deliver a masterful performance, one however that demonstrates he's either very brave or bordering on the edge of mental illness. I'm sure that last comment isn't very fair to the guy, but seriously, the story here is sensationalism disguised as a movie, with scenes that shock one into revulsion. Except for elitist movie critics of course, who will find it praiseworthy beyond words. Proceed at your own risk.","

Saltburn," saltburn
",hamzaarifshuja,17-Feb-24,"Saltburn is a story about Oliver, portrayed by Barry Keoghan(love him, who doesn't? I've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).His infatuation with Felix Catton, which starts at Oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. What starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.What struck me most about Saltburn is its clever use of Greek mythology as a narrative tool. The parallels drawn between Oliver's actions and the story of Theseus and the Minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. This mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding Oliver's character and his journey.The film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. In an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'Saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. Oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.Director Emerald Fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'Saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. Some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but I believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. The narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'Saltburn' stand out.The performances in the film are noteworthy. Barry Keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of Oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. The supporting cast, including Jacob Elordi and Rosamund Pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. I've been skeptical of them, but I was impressed.In conclusion, Saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. It's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea (I was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, Saltburn is definitely worth a watch. I've been skeptical of them, but I was impressed.","

Saltburn," A Tad Long
",statuskuo,24-Nov-23,"""Talented Mr. Ripley"" in reverse.I feel we are suppose to get a lesson here, but none is to be given. Perhaps is to be aware of poor social climbers who exhibit intelligence. I know WAY too many people like that. Which could be the message in itself. The idea of being popular runs a little too dark when a chance meeting between Felix (a rich Gatsby-esque character played by Jacob Elordi) and Oliver (a socially awkward, possibly autistic, bright literary genius) at Oxford.There are a few things that will rub you the wrong way. Yes, it's suppose to be a dark comedy. I think Rosamund Pike, who plays Felix's mother is the only one who understands that the key to dark comedy is to be a bit over the top. Richard E. Grant plays the Dad who, unfortunately doesn't get the big eyed meltdown until the end. The other things you will either love or hate....
There is no reason for ANYONE to like Oliver. Ever. Barry Keoghan plays him great, but it isn't like he flips a switch and becomes charismatic. In fact, he just becomes a weirdo saying charismatic things. Perhaps that's the intention. The family is so devoid of emotion that any genuine sign of it gains acceptance. Again, I never felt that.There is absolutely NO reason for Oliver to know that Felix would be so generous as to ingratiate him into his family by a flat tire ruse. The conceit of this entire film relies on the idea that Oliver is a grifter preying on this family and that someone would be kind enough to take him in. He sees what he wants, then has the shameless nature of approaching each one to gain favor. Honestly, one of the worse flip of the switch is when Oliver observes the sister of the household and seduces her (after a few words--saying she's a nympho doesn't make it so).Any way, Rosamund Pike is the only good thing about this flick. Jacob Elordi is also really good at embodying the rich snob with a heart. The rest is a bit mediocre. If you've seen these types of identity starved sociopath movies, you'll know what you're watching.","

I could delve into what does it say about class, privilege, social mobility etc but none of that matters. I think Emerald Fennell captured a cartoonish yet almost believable representation of the out of touch old money families of the UK and what it may be like not to have a financial care in the world.Barry Keoghan is equal parts charismatic and revolting as evidenced by his actions but we are never given more that the briefest sense of why, which doesn't matter because this is an absurd bit of fun that stays with you for days after.And about that last scene, I recently discovered it's a redux of the original video for murder on the dance floor.

",Med-Jasta,24-Dec-23,"The big problem here is the opening. It shows you everything that's going to happen. I reached to shut it off right there but I wasn't sure what the style was going to be. Then the narration went away and I knew that this wasn't part of the structure of the movie but just a fancy, ""Two weeks earlier.""I pushed through, but as the movie went on and I didn't see what happened in the opening I kept thinking of it. Nothing indicated violence or blood and what had happened so far was so far removed from the opening that I kept wondering how things were going to get there and how the story was going to make that turn. The director ruined her own movie. I was no longer pulled into the drama on screen but was preoccupied at what I was shown in the intro. This is like showing the preview before the movie. Then I was only reminded of things from the intro when we saw them. I'm afraid the movie was ruined for me.I wanted to give this a chance as the movie seemed like it could be something different. I had no idea what this movie was. I saw it on Prime and clicked on it. I had no clue what the story was, who was in it, nothing.The first thing I let go, that the plot description wasn't the plot but the themes of the movie. They want you to know what it's about going into it so you like it? Okay. I guess Gen Z wants to know that the movie is going to be commentary on current issues that they care about? And they don't want to figure it out for themselves?The second, before the movie started I said to myself and my pork rinds, ""It's going to start with classical music and an old school title card."" Somehow I was right. I couldn't believe it. Could I have really guessed this movie by the themes stated and the year it came out?The third, the opening shot, after the spoiler opening, a very long shot that went on for so long that it's coolness wore off quickly. The credits rolled out unevenly to last the entirety of the shot. I don't know why newer directors are in love with long takes. It's very cool to do this, you know when you don't notice it and it adds to the story. Ask DePalma, Hitchcock and Lynch how and why to do a long take.Fourth, full frame. Why? This is like recording in mono. Why do newer directors think that less screen is a good idea? I'm all for doing whatever but many times and I'm afraid this time is one, it just feels contrived and different just to be different.I hate to judge a movie off of it's technical things but this comes from the director who approves the script and everything else and can be indicative of the entire movie.I did eventually go to Wikipedia to read about what happened and yep, I was right about the eventual outcome. Well not so much as I was right but what they advertised at the start was exactly what it looked like... So I don't know why they did that? Are they afraid that Gen Z won't want to watch a movie if they don't know where it's going? Do you really have to tell people what they're going to see so they'll stay around? If that's true then even artsy movies are in trouble.","

From that moment Felix becomes friends with Oliver and decides to help him experience life like he never has before.

This film stars Barry Keoghan (Chernobyl), Jacob Elordi (Euphoria), Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl), Archie Madekwe (Midsommar) and Richard E. Grant (Gosford Park).Saltburn is a spectacular and disturbing cinematic masterpiece that's brilliantly put together. The cinematography, settings, acting, and writing reach an elite level. The story unfolds in a well-paced manner, with stupendous character evolutions. The film's nuances are smart, keeping viewers glued to every scene. This is like nothing I have ever seen and contains some of the most disturbing scenes I've ever witnessed. There's scenes I had to turn away and displayed obsession to grotesque perfection. Barry Keoghan delivers an Oscar-worthy performance, creating a serial killer vibe without being a typical serial killer...In conclusion, Saltburn is a disturbing yet captivating experience that leaves a lasting impression. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommended it.","

Saltburn," As Deliriously Entertaining As It Is Shocking
",david-meldrum,13-Jan-24,"Emerald Fennel's Saltburn is a caustic, funny, disturbing contribution to the burgeoning sub-genre of 'Eat The Rich' films, which like to make you chuckle as much as they try to elicit gasps of shock. It's a sign of growing societal anger at the super-rich that such films are finding such willing audiences and creators, and anger is an emotion that shone through Fennel's previous film, the similarly tonally mixed Promising Young Woman.If that film announced the arrival of a significant directorial talent, Saltburn cements her in the top division. Brilliantly written, technically flawless, and acted to perfection by a superb cast, it's a film that's notable for so much. It's firmly written and shot with the female gaze even if the central characters are male, deft tracking shots punctuate the film as layers of plot and character are peeled back, there are subtly brilliant tricks of cinematography, production design, sound design, and lighting, and music (to name a few) that mean it will reward multiple re-watchings. It's also, surely, the final confirmation of Barry Keoghan's arrival as a major player; his towering central performance allowing us to ruminate on the film's concern with how we are forced to play out pre-determined scripts for our lives, and what happens when we try to deviate from those willingly or unwillingly. I've seen the film criticised for unoriginality, which is surely to miss the point; not only does it wear its influences and sources on its sleeve (naming some of them explicitly), but it's precisely this complex meta-textuality that allows the film to work on so many levels and not just as a one-note satire.It will inevitably alienate some for whom the material is too shocking or too graphic, which is understandable; if that's not you, it's an invitation to something as deliriously entertaining as it is disturbing.","

Saltburn," A Collection of Clichés
",madridtouristguides,25-Dec-23,"Mrs. Fennell has made a cinematic cocktail which lacks of originality. By taking something from Passolini's Theorem, Joseph Losey's The Servant, René Clement's A Plein Soleil or Marco Ferreri's La Grand Bouffe, to name only the most obvious, Mrs. Fennell wrapped it in exquisite cinematography that cannot hide the defects of a contrived, talentless and predictable script for those who have seen some of the above films. The actors recite their texts well but, although some of them are renowned and of proven quality, they fail to give credibility to their characters because they have neither substance nor empathy. Completely unnecessary and of failed metaphorical sense is the director's scatological taste in some scenes. All in all, a failed film that should not satisfy its highly praised director.","

Saltburn," Holds fantastic cast performances
",r96sk,17-Jan-24,"I'm disturbed. Outstandingly disturbed, mind you.It is very out there as it features some uncomfortable moments, but that's never a bad thing if it's done right... and boy is it here. The film does an excellent job at making it all fit, which is actually quite impressive. Main plot-wise, it's not a hard one to predict... or at least not quite as unpredictable as the film possibly thinks it is based on the 'reveals' (?) at the end, but again: never a bad thing if done correctly. The main takeaway from all this is certainly the unsettling stuff.This 2023 production also holds fantastic cast performances. Barry Keoghan is top notch, I've seen various people online rave about him as an actor but I hadn't really seen it until now. Jacob Elordi merits praise too, as does Rosamund Pike - another one I haven't previously been too keen on, though she is fun here. In fact, on paper it's an iffy cast to me. In reality, the cast are perfect. Credit also to Richard E. Grant, Alison Oliver and Archie Madekwe.No doubt, 'Saltburn' is a great movie! A must-watch, I'd say. Emerald Fennell is two for two with me now, after I also highly enjoyed 'Promising Young Woman' (same rating, fwiw).","

Saltburn," Gothic Freakshow
",evanston_dad,28-Dec-23,"Based on other things I've seen Barry Keoghan in, I wasn't at all surprised to find him playing another creepy psycho, but I was surprised to find him so sexy. The entire story of ""Saltburn"" revolves around Keoghan's character having an erotic allure that others can't resist, and damn if he doesn't pull that off.I had a lot of fun with this movie. It has surprisingly little to say and is fairly trashy overall, but it's got a lot of style and feels very original compared to a lot of other things playing right now. I was disappointed that Emerald Fennell decided to resort to such clunky exposition at the film's conclusion, since she doesn't tell us anything we hadn't already figured out for ourselves, and in any case it would have been more compelling to leave everything more ambiguous. But the rest of the movie is so strong that the ending didn't ruin it for me.Grade: A.","

The characters are stereotypes, two dimensional and totally unlikeable, but maybe that's the point. The best part was the last 10 minutes because that was when it was ending. The cinematography is good and the soundtrack isn't bad. It was just such a cynical, pointless and empty film, with nothing original to say, and if I had paid to see it at the cinema I'd have wanted a refund. All the actors are better than this.

The movie follows a poor college student who goes home with his rich friends, where... Things happen.I'm not sure where to begin. I'll start by saying this movie has things I've never seen before in a movie. Nothing too graphic, but some very, very weird stuff. It's also artistically beautiful, and very subtle at times (it reminds me of White Lotus; if you liked that, you'll probably like this).

Saltburn," Surprisingly good yarn
",mrglenngrant,16-Jan-24,"I'd heard all the hype about this film ... and Indy's review after seeing it in the movies (weird and shocking) ... so I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I queued it up on Netflix.What I got surpassed any expectations because I had the impression it was an arty smutfest full of weird sex acts and other debauchery .... and although there was certainly a fair bit of that, there wasn't nearly as much as I thought there would be and what there was didn't take away from what was a genuinely interesting story of infatuation and deception.The acting was tremendous - with Pike and Grant as real stand-outs as the uber-eccentric mother and father. The Farleigh character was sometimes a bit too cruel for me though- which somehow took away the believability a little.It was a tiny bit predictable in that it was obvious towards the end that he was bumping them off - but the twist was that he'd been plotting to do it since before he even first encountered Felix. This explains all the lying about his family - to set Felix and his family up so he would win them over.It wasn't explained what happened to Elspeth in the end ... which is a pity (because I like things neatly tied up, thankyou very much).V. good.81/100.","

However, someone suggested it to me and they said I would love it. After watching the film and knowing they said I would love it, made me wonder just what my friend thinks of me.But she may not be wrong, because I am truly obsessed.It was shocking. Unnerving. Twisted. Poetic. Romantic. Disturbing. And a whole bunch of other words that might not be suitable for this platform.You begin the movie by meeting sweet, innocent Oliver who is a new student at Oxford. He comes from a family that is what he describes as poverty level and mother is a drunk and father is a drug addict. Insert beautiful Felix. Felix comes from generational wealth and is that popular guy everyone wants to be friends with. He quickly takes Oliver under his wing and invites him to stay at the family residence of Saltburn.From the beginning, there are scenes that make you question if Ollie is in love with Felix. Or is he obsessed? Or does he want to be Felix? You do not fully get your answer until the last four minutes.As someone who is studying to be a mental health therapist, I would like to pretend I was not observing and assessing Ollie the entire time, but that would be a lie. There are certain acts, mostly revolving around sex and sensuality that leave you speechless. You will want to google Ollie's symptoms immediately after the credits begin to roll.I commend the actor, Barry Keoghan, who played Ollie. He played this role beautifully and truly became the character. It was so well done, but you will be speechless, shocked, and most likely disturbed. I encourage you to embrace the madness.","

",skepticskeptical,18-Feb-24,"No one who has seen either Plein Soleil (Purple Noon) or The Talented Mr. Ripley (or read the book on which they are based) can possibly watch Saltburn without concluding during the final act that the big zinger was lifted directly from Patricia Highsmith's oeuvre. In fact, she may well have a short story along these lines. I would be surprised if she did not.The cinematography is excellent. I do not regret having watched this film, but it is quite far from being great. It's a bit of a bait-and-switch in the sense that two-thirds of the film pretends to be a critique of class inequities. Then along comes the ending, when we come learn the truth. Nothing was as it seemed. It's not about inequity but iniquity!","

",pvaltas,22-Nov-23,"Saltburn moves along at a good pace, rather stylish and hip as it creates some anticipation for where it may be going. It develops a bit of mystery but we never understand the motivation for the protagonist character. Not much depth for the various character, so can't get invested in them. Several scenes are designed to depict ridiculous opulence and wealth, so as to contribute to why the main character has disdain for this, yet we don't ever feel this disdain.As the end approaches it becomes predictable while it quickly and conveniently fills in the holes of whatever mysteries it tried to create. Overall, Saltburn lacks substance and hence I was left feeling with the lack of meaning for whatever message the film is trying to depict.","

Saltburn," As pretty and structurally unsound as a crumbling country pile
",johnpmoseley,23-Nov-23,"Oliver, a seemingly working-class Oxford student, falls in with a group of upper-class kids, one of whom invites him to his huge old stately home (Saltburn) and may be an object of obsession for him. Oliver is thus, or roughly thus, led into elaborate lies and worse. My uncertainties here are because the plot is never really clear.It's probably not a deliberate irony that the film often appears to want to be The Talented Mr. Ripley, possibly the greatest story ever about wanting to be someone else. Unfortunately, it also apes, by turns, Brideshead Revisited, The Servant and The Little Stranger. These impulses are not compatible and all said precursors are vastly superior.The script's one real strength lies in the area where writer-director Emerald Fennel was, presumably, able to write what she knows not from other people's art but her own experience: an upper-class British person herself, her depictions of upper-class British people are mercilessly perfect, ably abetted by very funny performances from Richard E. Grant and, especially, Rosamund Pike.But that accounts for about five minutes in an otherwise quite astonishingly amateurish mess. Oliver is either the sad sexual obsessive of Ripley or the single-mindedly sociopathic revanchist class warrior of The Servant. The two do not go together; the only real guiding principle seems to be whatever transgressive, would-be shocking image Fennel wants to show us. Furthermore, in class warrior guise, Oliver is supposed to be carrying out an elaborate, precisely calibrated, 5D chess stratagem that in reality depends on absurdly impossible luck and the fog-brained gullibility of everyone else concerned.This review is a rewrite. Fennel should, at best, have done more of those herself. Her film's grainy, grimy, fashion-shoot prettiness, which seduced me a little at first - hence the rewrite - has soured over time like perfume used to cover up the smell of putrefying corpses. It's bad enough that Fennel has written characters stupid enough to be duped by such transparent ruses. It's wqrse that she seems to expect this of her viewers too - and perhaps even a little worse yet that some of them, on the evidence of these reviews, have fallen in line.","

Who is behind this and what actually happened at Saltburn forms rest of the story.Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick is the star of the show. He simply aces his character that opts for no hold barred type of performance and shines in multiple scenes throughout. This was definitely an uneasy watch but it did pay off superbly in the end. Not going to lie but the story being set in England and that accent, helped too. The slow narrative actually contributed to building the intensity with the elaborated scenes to showcase Oliver's demeanour. Despite the predictability, the final confession still had the chills.

Although I've seen plenty of docos of stranger events.Fennell's direction has you cringing in certain scenes, but they are all beautifully resolved.

It's been done before, and it's been done better. The plot twist I could see coming halfway through the movie although they did a good job doing the whole ""who's the evil one here"" shabang at the beginning. Just got predictable the longer you watch. And also there were some very cringe inducing scenes in this and not the good kind of cringe. Once you see the movie, you'll know EXACTLY what scenes i'm referring to. Plot had potential, could've been done better, hell, could've been done different. All in all, this was pretty average and that's about it.(On a sidenote... Why does Barry Keoghan always play such creepy roles?

Saltburn," An Outstanding Achievement and a Massive Step Up For Emerald Fennell
",cdjh-81125,19-Nov-23,"I'm in utter shock at how good Saltburn turned out to be. I was looking forward to it but I didn't expect to be top 5 of the year (maybe even top 10 of the decade) for me. That's only because I really liked Promising Young Woman but I wasn't totally blown away by it. It had so many great concepts and moments but some of the execution was a bit lacking for me. But I can confidently say Emerald Fennell elevated her craft in every single way for her second movie.This script is almost completely air tight. I was intrigued from almost the first frame and it never let me go from there. Fennell's been very open about the influence of The Talent Mr Ripley on this film and it's very apparent but she absolutely does her own thing with it. It doesn't always feel like it's going in a specific direction but I was always excited to see where it was going.This character, played perfectly in what I think is Barry Keoghan's best performance, is so interesting and I never quite knew how to feel about him in all the best ways. Fennell builds up his connection with Jacob Elordi so well and there's such a specific chemistry between the 2 of them that was riveting to watch and they took Elrodi's character in a direction I didn't expect but absolutely loved.I won't go as far as to say that I didn't predict any of the twists or turns. There were some reveals that I did see coming but it all comes down to execution and every single beat and plot revelation of this script felt earned from a character perspective and took everything to a satisfying conclusion. I've already mentioned the Mr Ripley inspiration but there's a little Knives Out in there, some illusions to Parasite, hints to Get Out and even The Shining.That's not to say Fennell is being derivative here because this film absolutely feels like her vision through and through and it's so impressive just how many tones she managed to blend seamlessly. My only real issue with the script, and really the film overall, is Fennell's need to occasionally over explain things. There's a lot of backstory to these characters but the means in which she delivers the exposition around them can feel forced and like the scene just has to stop to fill in their history. Certain scenes towards the end makes these moments more understandable in retrospect but it still felt clunky in the moment.The technical prowess on display was astounding. Based off the trailers, I wasn't sure if I was going to like the unique aspect ratio this film employs but it ended up working perfectly for me. It gave a sense of intimacy to everything and it let me get more immersed into the character interactions and even the broader landscape shots as well. The camerawork Fennell pulls of here is insane, there are so many impressive one takes and it has without a doubt one of the most unique final shots I've seen in a movie in a long time. The cinematography is also jaw dropping, it's Roger Deakins level stuff for me and it honestly made my jaw drop more than once. If it doesn't get nominated for, let alone win, the Oscar I'll be outraged.Saltburn is such an experience of a movie that I can't help but in awe of what Emerald Fennell pulled off. It's constantly intriguing, tension filled and investing despite the truly horrible acts done by the characters. It's visually stunning with some of the best performances I've seen from most of these actors. It hasn't left my mind in the day since I saw it and it just feels like the kind of movie we don't see enough of. Amazon are absolutely killing it this year with Air and now this and they need to keep putting these kinds of movies in theatres. After this, I can't wait to see what Emerald Fennell does next because if she puts out another film of this quality she'll be well on her way to being one of the best directors working right now.","

Saltburn," So yeah it was gross but weirdly captivating
",duncannoella,13-Jan-24,"This is the first film I've watched by Emerald Fenell so I didn't know what to expect. I went in this film totally blind (though I think I shouldn't have) and suprisingly I enjoyed it.Though, quite provocative through its provocative and sometimes uncomfortable scenes, I found the film utterly captivating from start to finish. In my opinion its a great film that transports you through its smart and intricate writing. Brillant performances by the actors, I mean that dinner scene around the end of the film was just breathtaking. The film is so compelling with a lot of twist and turns that keeps you hooked from beginning to end and i have to acknowledge the amazing cinematography in this film. It's just beautiful and visually stunning.So overall, even though this film isn't for everyone I'd recommend to give it a try.","

",francesco-musolino,29-Dec-23,"Cavesco - the scene of the blood and blood vessels in the bag - long scenes designed to disturb the dreams of teenagers with close-ups and sweat on the bodies... how boring. The protagonist with an idiotic face like few others is passed off as an evil genius and after half an hour the whole plot is revealed. A film for kids, a little cringe and decidedly overrated.No one notices anything, the protagonist lies and there are plot holes like tunnels but despite everything we have to believe that he is not a loser but a great evil genius. The highlight obviously are the male nudes with close-ups and the final dance scene... very very trash. Ridiculous.","

Saltburn," sloppy writing, fails the audience, not credible, very derivative
",ashlleyshae,22-Nov-23,"Do not waste your money on Saltburn. Instead watch Moliere's Tartuffe at a theatre, or read the case of the French aristocratic family scammed by Thierry Tilly - which are obvious borrowings in this unoriginal mish-mash of a film. This reminds of what Laura Neal did in bad writing to finale 'Killing Eve'. It betrays the audience, is badly written, and poorly made - it talks down to the audience and mocks any investigative law enforcement. Visually it looks good, but it is a silly romp that does not satisfy, the characters are two-dimensional, and the occasional insight is swiftly blunted. There is no brilliance here - only an overpaid, overrated maker either losing it, or saying 'F... You' to cinema-goers. Don't waste your time. Filmed at Shotover Park fits - for a lazy shot in the dark that fails cinema.","

Saltburn," Beguiling Allegory of Classism
",JoshuaMercott,12-Jan-24,"The rich and privileged elite have their own excessive tastes, not all of them desirable. ""Saltburn"" made numerous references to the posh, sometimes pointless, tropes that some of the wealthy are known to indulge in.""Saltburn"" took a normal guy named Oliver Quick and showed how 'quickly' he could be charmed and mesmerized by the dubiously immoral elite class. Satirical storytelling at one of its most nuanced, this movie soon became a lesson in multi-layered and deviantly intelligent filmmaking.Remarkable performances by Barry Keoghan (as Oliver Quick), Jacob Elordi (as Felix Catton), Rosamund Pike (as Elspeth Catton), Alison Oliver (as Venetia Catton), and Richard E. Grant (as Sir James Catton) carried this unforgettable plot across the finish line.Special shout-out to Archie Madekwe (as Farleigh Start), Ewan Mitchell (as Michael Gavey), and Carey Mulligan (as Pamela). They adeptly balanced the roster of quirky characters in ""Saltburn"".Oxford University came alive on screen, especially those parts where an 'outsider' like Oliver didn't quite fit in. A silent peer pressure prevailed, compelling him to accept his so-called fate of being 'ruled' by those who seemingly exerted an undeniable level of charm, like the much-beloved Felix Catton.The title sounded like it was referencing a drug, but in truth it was the name of the wealthy estate the Cattons called their castle. It was here Oliver lost his class-based 'virginity' and surrendered to the desire of becoming one of the one percent.There was more classism allegory than convenient bisexuality in this story. It took seemingly simple human perspectives and skewed them out of context until a darker human truth revealed itself. This was the genius behind Emerald Fennell's ""Saltburn"" movie.I loved how allegorical Oliver Quick's journey was as he gradually grew close to the man (Felix) whom he emulated, even wanted to become. He who came from nothing wanted to have everything.His invitation to stay at Saltburn with the Cattons gave ""Ollie"" all the room he needed to indulge that desire, even doing whatever it took to get it. The way he conned his way into the family's good graces was not far-fetched. There are thousands of Ollies out there accomplishing much the same.In this alluring story where nothing was as it seemed, eccentricities and debaucheries confluenced into empathy, the need to belong, and the dirty desire to climb the social ladder at whatever bloody cost.Suffice to say, ""Saltburn"" can be seen a few times and will probably manage to convey a different secret message with each viewing.","

Saltburn," Just give Barry Keoghan his damn oscar already
",CMTempest,10-Dec-23,"Evidently the jinx of the ""sophomore slump"" held no claim over Emerald Fennell, Britain's new filmmaking auteur and cinematic wunderkind. In only her second movie, the popular writer-director has already soared past expectations, delivering a film which not only far surpasses the success of her debut Promising Young Woman (which was excellent), but which succeeds so well in all its ambitions that it just might belong in the conversation for genre classic. It certainly ranks quite high among my personal favorites for films of its kind.In my opinion, Saltburn is a masterpiece. A purely singular, cinematic tour-de-force, with an abundance of style, all put to use in service of a story that is both attractive and engrossing, while never ceasing to be entertaining. It's the kind of film that sears itself in your memory with its brazenness-to say nothing of the level of prurience that permeates some of the more salacious/depraved bits. I know that sounds like it could be a negative, but believe me, it definitely works in this film's favor; keeping the tone both erotically charged as well as deeply unsettling. In fact, the whole film is astoundingly well-balanced, maintaining a sly confidence in itself which makes it all the more entrancing despite (because of?) it taking things to such extremes. Occasionally you might feel like recoiling, but you'll remain unable to look away.Since the film only released wide several weeks ago, I'll refrain from saying much about plot specifics in this review (nothing beyond superficial comparison anyway), as I'd hate to spoil anyone from having the same incredible experience I had going in blind. This is an opportunity that hopefully most people will be afforded, owing to the stellar marketing for the film which somehow managed to build intrigue without revealing hardly anything about the story (take note studio heads, this is how it should be done!). It's an especially blessed achievement in this case, as this is a film with a deviously good script and it'd be a shame to miss out on its myriad surprises.Additionally, with Saltburn, Emerald Fennell has not only gifted us fans of crime/mystery stories with a modern genre masterpiece, she has also given us the best Ripley movie without Tom Ripley. Indeed, the film evokes a superlative, verging on definitive, homage to the famous amoral hedonist with a knack for escaping consequences, and I would honestly be shocked to find out Fennell wasn't a Highsmith fan. At times this script feels almost like a re-imagining of The Talented Mr. Ripley for the millennial generation; albeit one cleverly tailored to the sensibilities and sexual fluidity of the Euphoria crowd. The use of hyper-stylized cinematography, as well as the film's decidedly ""in vogue"" choice of music, also evoke the style of that series to a degree. That said, Jacob Elordi playing against type as the rich aristocrat Felix Catton (ostensibly a spoiled playboy, but whose surprising sensitive side may reveal him to be an actual decent person) subverts those expectations in the best way.Whatever the reality behind her inspiration, this film is in no way a mere imitation of another work. Instead, Fennell more than proves her mettle as a writer/director capable of executing her unique ideas with extreme precision. Frankly, she couldn't seem more at home in the genre, and despite a concept that on the surface may appear to be aiming at mere homage, Fennell spares no time proving that notion false; taking a deceptively original approach to a tried and true theme, and running with it to intoxicating effect.Saltburn is an utterly enthralling mystery, with an impressively sustained blend of familiarity and unpredictability. The script is brimming with witty dialogue, wickedly dark humor, compelling social commentary on class division, and no shortage of clever twists. All in all, this makes for a fiercely captivating affair from start to finish. So much so, in fact, that when the many disparate threads finally start to come together in the final act, the result is harrowing and nothing short of extraordinary!This is filmmaking of the highest order from someone who is quickly becoming one of the most interesting artists working today. If it wasn't such a crowded year I would say Fennell was a shoe-in for another best original screenplay nom. Although then again, when considering the uncomfortable nature of certain moments in the film, it may be a stretch to think the academy is ready to vote for something this far out. I hope they're not all too close-minded to recognize Fennell's talent though, and this at least ends up getting some (well-deserved) awards attention. In any case, if she's able to keep up the momentum then her work will soon be impossible to ignore, no matter how dark/insane she decides to go with her next project. Personally, I'd love to see her re-team with Keoghan/Mulligan and try her hand at a full-on horror flick!Anyways, beyond the film's critical reception, what perhaps will be most interesting is seeing the overall response it gets from general audiences. I'd imagine they won't be expecting just how shocking certain aspects of the story are, and all those forming their expectations based on her first film (like I did) are likely to be caught off guard by a handful of these scenes (if not outright turned off). The film never felt in any way exploitative or pretentious to me though. On the contrary, I felt like the balance and tone that it struck were basically flawless. Even if a small number of viewers do find it too offensive, that will probably just add to the allure of the film. Ultimately, the purity of conviction shown by the creative team in taking things as far as they did clearly panned out.Suffice it to say, I've never seen anything quite like this film, and I was completely blown away. In fact, for me, it rather handily beats out Oppenheimer, Beau is Afraid, and Killers of the Flower Moon as the best of the year, and I'd go so far as to call it a film destined to be discussed, analyzed, argued over, and admired by cinephiles of every kind for years to come.Finally, I'd be remiss not to mention the film's true Oscar potential, and that's Barry Keoghan. His raw performance as the socially awkward, yet smart and deeply enigmatic loner Oliver Quick is so brilliantly nuanced, mysterious, and disturbing that I can all but guarantee it will ""make your blood run cold."" Barry is absolutely the underdog to look out for come award season, and this film proves, decisively, that he was the perfect choice to take up the mantle of the Joker.Rating: 9.5/10.....Edited to add - I can't believe I forgot to praise the incredible use of ""Murder on the Dance Floor"" in one of the film's final montages. I've been waiting forever for someone to re-tap the potential of the song, and its use here might be the best of any hit since The Pixies' ""Where is my Mind?"" swelled up at the end of Fight Club.","

",kosmasp,01-Jan-24,"No pun intended - yes I've seen the movie! But is that what I mean with my summary headline? Hardly! I think most can feel what the main character goes through. And in a wicked way we probably root for him, the movie makes it easy for us to do so. Of course there is more there - and slowly something appears before our eyes.Certain things are said - and because we do not have any evidence of the contrary we take them at face value ... right? Well that is how it works. And Barry, the lead actor, whom you may have seen in some other stuff (Dunkirk, Killing of a sacred Deer or recently the Banshees movie - where he stole the show! Not an easy feat mind you) ... and I doubt it will be long before he finally wins an Oscar (aka Academy Award)! Maybe even for this? Not sure how the mechanics work for that ... but it would be deserving for sure. Nomination is a given (I'd be surprised if not).That all being said, the movie is really messing with you. And I understand if you are looking for a broader sense, a message, that you may not find it here ... but that is life. And this is here to showcase the acting abilities of the people involved ... while telling quite the gripping and tension filled story ... nail biting in a sense to say the least. Just got this in for 2023 for myself - which makes it a candidate for my top list of the year.","

Saltburn," Unforgettable experience
",ignatdanilchuk,23-Jan-24,"Discussed on all social networks, Emerald Fennell's film ""Saltburn"" hooks you from the first minute. The first frames immediately immerse us inside the head of the main character Oliver, and do not let us go until the very end.The plot of the film revolves around Oliver and Felix, who study at Oxford. Oliver is a shy guy who can't make friends in a new place. But he finds the strength to meet Felix. With their acquaintance, their rapprochement into best friends begins.The acting performance of Barry Keoghan, who played Oliver, undeservedly went unnoticed by the film academy. From film to film, Barry proves to everyone that he is a great actor, but this film was his peak. He was paired with Jacob Elordi (Felix), familiar to us from the TV series Euphoria, who is slowly getting closer to leading roles in films. Together with Barry, they have great chemistry on camera, and the relationship they develop is interesting to watch.The film was shot in a 4:3 format, unusual for modern times, which at first glance may discourage you from watching the film. But after the first part of the film, every frame justifies the format chosen by the director. The frame, which is narrowed on the sides, makes the characters even closer and the atmosphere more personal, as if the photograph has its own story behind it.Emotionally, the film will not leave you indifferent. Watching can be compared to a roller coaster. At first we are immersed in one genre, but by the end of the film we find ourselves in a completely different one.Overall, this is a film that will keep you engaged. A captivating plot and outstanding acting will make watching ""Saltburn"" an unforgettable cinematic experience.","

Saltburn," Overrated
",rgxdzrybr,01-Feb-24,"I seriously question the praise for this movie. What is going on with people so easily taken in by this because it's supposed to be a dark comedy or satire?The way the main character gets off on the bodily fluids of certain characters is for shock . The idea is that he's vampiric in his obsession with them but Emerald Fennell who wrote and directed it chooses one of the most grotesque ways of expressing this. It's supposedly a lampooning of the wealthy but they come across in a way we have grown to use to. Self satisfied, rude , patronizing when they play their games with lower classes and wannabes. If anything it seems to be saying beware of anyone not impossibly wealthy they will take advantage. Nothing the main character does to them makes us care about them so it's all pointless.Parasite was good commentary topic of classism. Saltburn is dreadful. Some decent acting but not enough to make a difference .I also get tired of being told something is a dark comedy when it isn't. Fargo was a good dark comedy with a moral center and genuinely funny as well. Filmmakers need to look at films like Fargo or Burn After Reading or The Apartment and learn how to write a good dark comedy.","

",jromanbaker,04-Jan-24,"Long, long ago there was a horror film made in 3D called ' The Maze ' and in the centre there was something shocking and terrible. In this film there is something beautiful and threatening. A Minotaur statue with more sexual potency than anything else in this meandering film. I like to think this statue was going to bring down the House of the Ruling Classes, but alas statues move terribly slowly. In all seriousness ( that's a laugh ) with shades of ' Theorem ' and ' The Servant ' a handsome young man gets involved with horror of horrors another young man and takes him home to his architecturally appalling pile and introduces him to daddy, mummy and infantile sister. Familiar territory and with veiled homoeroticism a gullible audience like me gets a few Hammer horror shocks. The grave scene by the way is not that shocking and only one scene is but no more spoilers. The actors do their best, but the two leading young males seemed to walk and dance their way through, but Mulligan and Pike steal what is left to steal. Putting it gently I give it a three because in some weird way it does represent the UK today, and as an historical document for the future it maybe valid. If Cinema as we feebly know it now exists by then.","

",jameswood-39570,18-Nov-23,Do you not see this the so called movie 50% of it is basically soft core Porn it's 45% of it is poorly acted out in horribly conveyed scenes and only 5% of it is actually watchable.I decided to leave the theater after I witnessed necrophilia being committed on screen I decided to sit through the sex scene with the main character performing oral sex on lady during her period I decided to sit through the cum licking scene of the bath drain but necrophilia is where I draw the line.These seans were disgusting in their own right they were also several minutes long each and all of them were completely disgusting uncut it had no other audio than the heavy breathing or moning from the actors.The only good reviews I've seen for this so called the film or about how it's got a female director which should have nothing to do with the overall quality in my opinion or how it's captivating and you can't take your eyes of the screen I agree with that in the way that you cannot take your eyes off of a car accident.,"

Saltburn," Like a bad telenovela
",Waedliman,23-Dec-23,"There are probably only two camps when it comes to this movie. Some will celebrate it (and misunderstand it), others will reject it because they find it undemanding and confusing. I belong to the second category. Maybe I'm too old and have seen enough movies to be able to say that the plot of Saltburn isn't really new. I also know Absolutely Fabulous, so I can see quite clearly that Rosamunde Pike seems to have stolen from Jennifer Saunders. Her dialog, her tone of voice, everything is reminiscent of Edwina Monsoon, Saunders' character. Apart from that, this comedy is not a comedy at all, but mixes satire with drama, is rarely funny, but mostly you wait for the supposedly too obscene scenes, only to realize that they are more likely the result of good marketing around the film. Yes, they are unusual, but they fit well with the character of the main character, a narcissist who thinks he has fallen for someone, but whose real goal is something completely different. You eventually realize that this Oliver is not the victim he claims to be, but an exceedingly clever fellow who has the entire aristocracy in his pocket. Emereld Fennell's direction is addicted to beautiful images on the one hand, but on the other we see party scenes like something out of a bad Spanish TV series. Everything just doesn't want to fit together. In the end, I'm ashamed that I stuck it out. It's not worth it in the end.","

Saltburn," Kinda salty, kinda sweet
",ivantheeditor,13-Feb-24,"Well that was a surprise! Definitely not a movie for everyone. You have to be a little weird and twisted to like this one. I already knew it was a weird movie when I started it because people warned me but I didn't know what to expect. It was actually a lot more ""real"" than ""fantasy"". Like this looks like something that could actually happen. Let's hope it never does but all the personalities in this movie were very much real. We've all met people like that in our lives.As far as production goes - absolutely beautiful. A true masterpiece.However, the pacing was definitely quite slow. There were quite a few moments where I caught myself looking at the clock. There was no need to waste my time like that. Those extended, long, dramatic scenes did not add anything to the story. The movie would have been just fine without it.Overall, highly recommend but definitely make sure to watch it alone. Or with someone you're VERY comfortable with. Some of these scenes are quite... disturbing.","

Saltburn," The Story Is Forced On Great Characters
",harrishcraig,22-Dec-23,"There are many scenes in Saltburn that are unnecessary and lead one to believe that the writer thought they were creating one thing but the audience was seeing another. The big reveal toward the end reveals nothing and is unnecessary. The dialog is great. Keoghan is an actor I always admire and here, he and all the actors are marvelous. After
A Promising Young Woman, I understand why everyone wanted to work with Fennell. Unfortunately her story is outlandish and what was potentially another masterwork becomes a disappointment as soon as the characters stop driving the story and the story is forced upon the characters. This is a disappointment. To watch it and then say, ""Bummer"". I suggest giving it a watch, many like this movie as I can tell by the 7.5 rating. I wish it all would have worked, I bet Fennell does too. So much was good but this is ultimately a big letdown.","

Saltburn," HATED IT!
",cmarino-24332,27-Dec-23,"I saw the reviews on TikTok saying it was so good, so disturbing, similar to The Talented Mr. Ripley, a must watch. Well I watched it. It didn't go anywhere for the first hour. The second hour you start to get somewhere. 45 minutes remaining is when things start to happen. There was no build up of the mc's behavior before that second hour. Even the end doesn't really give you much of an explanation to his actions. It was just weird, the mc was weird, and the family was eccentric. The family was likable (imo) and was hospitable and could be forceful when they wanted to be but not when they needed to be or should have been. Sometimes you can forgive the flaws in a movie if it's worthwhile but not in this one. So to sum up, It's a bit boring in the beginning, then the mc starts to be a manipulative here and there, then you have to wait until the last 45 minutes of the movie to get anywhere, then the end is just unsatisfying.","

Saltburn," Pass the sick bucket
",allylolly,23-Nov-23,It was attractive to look at and acting was very good but that's all. It left me feeling sick and uncomfortable and I really didn't see the point in the gross sex scenes. If the point was to shock then it did that but i wasn't impressed. I don't know why anyone would enjoy this film. Almost all the characters were horrible and Vacuous and it was a waste of my time. I saw it with my 15yr old daughter who has seen a lot of scary adult themed films. She also thought it was gross. I judge a film on whether I would want to see it again and I absolutely would not. I'd like it removed from my memory.,"

Saltburn," It Kept Me Awake!
",Moviegoer19,11-Jan-24,"These days I tend to fall asleep around halfway through films or even TV series, which is why the fact that I didn't with Saltburn is a big plus on its behalf.There was a lot about it that was really good, besides the acting of Barry Keoghan which was superlative. Specifically I'm referring to some of the sex that went on presumably both ""real"" and ""imagined."" Most (if not all?) of the sex scenes were shot in varying degrees of darkness which to me was very helpful in keeping me watching. I generally turn away from any scene I don't want to view whether it's sex or violence but the dark lighting in Saltburn was very artistically and pragmatically appropriate.What also kept me watching and awake until the end were the plot twists. Wow...very well-written script. It really got me. Plus the visual aspects of the film were both beautiful at times as well as entertaining.Finally, the emotional quotient of Saltburn was not as high as it might have been which is another good thing. Despite the fact that characters wound up dead, there was an element of comedic disbelief (if that's a thing!) which created a layer between what I was hearing and seeing and what I was feeling, i.e., ultimately it could have been very disturbing but it wasn't. Overall, definitely worth seeing.","

Saltburn," Pretentious tosh
",stephroberts_morgan,31-Dec-23,"If it hadn't been for Tiktok I wouldn't have even bothered watching but for all the 'OMG!' I(clickbait) reactions, my curiosity got the better of me. (I should have just fast forwarded to the 'OMG' parts, yawn, yeah, yeah.. nothing to see here, move along!.. and not wasted 2 hours!)Did I watch the same film that everybody else saw? Wasn't it supposed to be a psychological thriller? Where was that because it certainly wasn't apparent at any point, just about some student obsessed with some posh male totty who wasn't give him any - didn't require anything further on a 'deeper' level.Those 'shocking' scenes were provided for nothing more than pure sensationalism and frankly, if anyone found them shocking then you need to grow up and watch films worthy of the title 'psychological thriller' - if you're not too sensitive that is!Saltburn is absolute twaddle. The property and grounds were the best parts of the film, glorious building and landscapes, and shame on such good actors wanting to be involved in this drivel. Poor Richard E Grant.. what on earth were you thinking?! Was the comedic element intentional?Saltburn should be renamed Marmite - one will love it or hate it. I fall into the latter category.. completely overhyped.","

Saltburn," Talented mr ripley minus the talent
",sadianusratt,23-Dec-23,"It started off as pretty strong then quickly turned into something like talented mr Ripley. The whole thing is like someone from a ""working class"" family gets a taste of rich and wealthy lifestyle and not ready to let it go ever. Just like mr ripley the main character dies and some gets the hint and that maybe he's not a nice person after all except the parents. The director also adds some major cringe scenes like the bathtub scene, outside window scene with the sister and the grave scene. The entire film in general has been a total time waste. All these hype and turns out it's just a copycat movie. Also just like mr Ripley, he (barry) gets rich off the family's wealth and gets away with it. Terrible work.","

Saltburn," I give it a marginal recommendation
",preppy-3,23-Nov-23,"A strange one. Oliver (Barry Keoghan who looks like a young John Hurt) is attending Oxford University in the UK. He's shy and withdrawn. Then he meets outgoing, charasmatic Felix (Jacob Eldordi) and they become friends. Felix invites Oliver to spend the summer at his huge estate with him and his family. However his family is heavily dysfunctional and things get out of control. It all leads to an incredible twist ending that I didn't see coming. It's well-made and the acting is good. However it's slow-moving and the thick accents render some of the dialogue unintelligible. Still I give it a marginal recommendation.","

Predictable, dated, gross for the sake of it & slow in the extreme.The only good thing was the Barry Keoghan naked dance sequence well he is quite sexy afterall.Richard E Grant & the gone girl actress are always watchable as is Barry Keoghan but I've seen The Square, Triangle of sadness & Midsommar so if you want a messed up film to watch then this predictable teenage dramedy isn't going to cut it I'm afraid.Just watch the Talented Mr Ripley & then fast forward Saltburn to the dance sequence. Job done.The soundtrack is ok as far as soundtracks go.","

Saltburn," Disturbingly bad waste of time
",bwren72,06-Jan-24,The movie is about a smart creepy kid that tries to leech off of the rich well to do family of the only friend he has at Oxford over the summer. As the summer progresses his creepiness continues to grow in magnitude and he gets increasingly more pervy with his actions as he slowly kills off the family. I came into it thinking it was a horror or scary movie surrounded with a load of hype only to find Temu was called upon to write the script of this movie. Truly repulsive and disturbing movie that was a complete waste of time. I genuinely do not understand how many reviews are anything above a 3/10.,"

Saltburn," So Wahat..!!
",yusufpiskin,24-Dec-23,"Hasn't American and European cinema gone through the phase of introducing films as 'very brave' by putting a few extreme sexual scenes in them?So, with a few days left until 2024, when will they stop trying to portray gay male characters as feminine and subway sexual?I think the British are doing for Barry Keoghan what the Americans are doing for Timothée Chalamet... Maybe this is a retaliation... The man suddenly started acting in every movie and TV series everywhere...Moreover, even though she is 12 years younger than me, people couldn't stop praising her, even though she covered her face, which made her look 25 years older than me, with foundation and gave her the role of a teen-age student, but all her make-up exploded in close-ups.What seemed unique to you about this movie?1999's The Talented Mr. Haven't you watched the Ripley movie?Haven't you read the book published in 1955 yet?The script looks like a very bad copy.And I beg you, stop making 4:3 movies... While we were happy to be rid of the so-called 3D thing, now we also have the desire of award-winning directors to shoot 4:3 movies...","

Saltburn," What's the point?
",anecak-49687,08-Jan-24,"This movie sadly features stellar cast and great production value but that's about all that's good about the film. During its unnecessarily long showing I fondled my remote-control numerous times but in the end decided to see where the heck it's going and begrudgingly managed to sit through it. I shouldn't have. In my opinion it is derivative and nonsensical art-for-the-sake-of-art drivel all the way around from the senseless twaddle that's supposed to serve as dialog to gratuitous, shock and awe sex scenes which do not drive or add to the plot. And speaking of the plot, there isn't any. Someone here said that the third act requires a huge suspension of disbelief but that was too kindly put. The main protagonist gets poisoned and there is no police investigation although he is obviously poisoned? The ""parents"" are more concerned about the lunch than the death of their son? Everything that went on was premeditated? Really? The truth is that the movie was going nowhere and with over 2 hours of running time they had to wrap it up somehow. And they did, very poorly. Talented Mr. Ripley it is not.","

Saltburn," NOTHING THOUGHT PROVOKING OR INTERESTING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
",lucysarumova-87071,30-Dec-23,"This film, Saltburn, is an unfortunate mishmash that attempts to blend The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, and Two Girls One Cup, but the result is a catastrophic disappointment. Rather than offering any semblance of originality or artistic vision, it relies solely on shock value, making it a painful watch for anyone expecting depth or genuine creativity.The predictability of the plot only exacerbates the film's inherent flaws, dragging its pacing to a mind-numbing slowness. It's disheartening to witness a movie that seemingly sacrifices any potential for artistic merit in favor of cheap thrills and shock tactics. Anyone praising this film must be unfamiliar with the richness of true cinematic excellence.Saltburn, in its lack of substance, manages to be not only a waste of time but also a drain on precious brain cells. For those seeking genuine cinematic experiences, this film falls painfully short, leaving behind a bitter taste of disappointment and frustration.","

Saltburn," gratuitous
",h-maslon99,23-Oct-23,"Salt burn did not hold together for me and i thought the cringy moments which were extreme and frequent were gratuitous. There seemed to be no sequence or lead up to the twists and turns of the main character. It's as if the filmmaker had an idea but didn't have a deep enough understanding if human psychology to really draw me in and pull it off. Suddenly he was doing something i could barely watch.... and i just didn't believe it. It's was gorgeous, but it seemed all surface. I compared it to The Talented Mr Ripely. A far better film that leads up slowly. Giving us hints and and insight into Leonardo Di Caprio character Thus film did none of that. Frankly i really did not like this film i gave it 4 stars for the visuals and some good acting.","

Saltburn," A social commentary that doesn't deliver as a film
",ernesti,25-Dec-23,"While watching the film I found myself constantly snacking and doing other chores and still getting bored just listening to the dialogue that does not tell the story. The absense of musical score, tension and poor pacing made this two hour film a great ordeal to overcome.There are filmmakers that have a lot to say and their movies lack unnecessary scenes and dialogs and are completely polished and engage the viewer completely. This movie has none of that. Its maker obviously had social commentary in mind and she had seen ""Call me by your name"" too. Then it needs some disgusting and provocative scenes that didn't appear to do the trick because the maker failed to deliver the shock.It left me very little ideas to interpret and in the end it ended up being this the rich vs. The poor type of social commentary and climbing up in the foodchain kind of art movie. It was just too boring and didn't really give me the thrill of seeing a great piece of cinema. Also using letterbox aspect was a poor artistic choice.","

As for the acting, well, lack of it. It must have been cobbled together in an afternoon. The characters aren't just wooden they are balsa wood and the ones who are known just play themselves. Some grim stately pile will have made a few bob for letting the gilm crew in, so at least it paid for the grass to be mown. Poor form having to explain what was such an obvious plot.

Saltburn," Murdering the Sun
",jerryhulse,21-Jan-24,"It's quite insane, and I love it. I don't entirely agree with the comments suggesting that ""Oliver is money-sexual."" His meticulous design from the beginning is to get close to Felix, creating a connection beyond the distant and almost pitiful distance between the prince and the dark corner.It seems similar to ""Genius Loci,"" but there are subtle differences in emotional depth and direction. The male lead in Genius Loci wants to become the second male lead, live the second male lead's life, secretly wear his clothes and shoes when the second male lead is not at home - desires surpassing mere infatuation.Oliver is different. He enters Oxford, glimpses Felix through the window surrounded by a courtyard crowd, and falls deeply in love with him at first sight.Oliver is an outsider, an oddity, despite being intelligent and diligent-reading fifty books in one summer, writing a substantial thesis, knowledgeable, yet unable to win the affection or even much attention from classmates.He knows what type of person Felix would be interested in, understands what roles his middle-class background (actually, upper-middle class) allows him to play. The roles with the highest chance of success, the scripts most likely to secure friendships - he grabs them all.A significant part of Oliver's infatuation with Felix is due to Felix's privileged background. It's the upper class that can nurture someone like Felix - carefree, handsome, and charming. Easily garnering affection from everyone at parties, pointing out the most beautiful girls, a comprehensive abundance in both material and emotional aspects.Oliver might lament the lack of love for him, while Felix frets over too much love from others.Felix's sympathy for the weak is his virtue, a trait Oliver exploits. This kindness seems pure but also like an aloof upper-class person observing a human tragedy from a distance - akin to an audience enjoying a spectacular death in a horror movie, sighing with a mix of sympathy and satisfaction.But Pamela, Oliver, and the briefly mentioned ""Eddie from last summer,"" each one of them is vividly alive.Felix and his mother squeeze stories out of their ""friends,"" just like losing interest in a once-beloved movie after repeated viewings. The ""friends,"" along with their luggage, are sent away by the loyal butler at night or in the morning, never disturbing the master's enjoyment of solitude.Oliver's infatuation with Felix deepens time and again. It's inevitable. Despite having money in his wallet, he pretends not to when paying the bill. Though he's 80% sure Felix is aware of his predicament, when Felix actually walks over, pays for him, and adds, ""I found the money you dropped on the ground,"" to save face in front of the bartender, Oliver is genuinely relieved.When it's good, it's genuinely good, like the radiant sun finally noticing the weeds growing in the corner and generously bathing them in warm light. The warmth is so comforting that, having experienced it once, you never want to go back to the damp, sunless corner.Oliver wants to be Felix's friend, a good friend, preferably invited to live in the dreamy castle forever.When Felix's cousin mocks him, saying, ""Living in the castle is a dream for you, something you can only reminisce about in the future. But for me, this is my home, and I can return anytime.""What is Oliver thinking? Probably that even if it's a dream, he wants to replace reality with it, to be intoxicated in this dream for a long, long time.He doesn't plan to tell children the story of that summer on a recliner decades later. He wants to plunder the master of this dream, deviously stealing the authority to dream.What if Felix forgives him, responds to this love, even if it's just a little, forgiving his deception, letting him stay in the castle? It's an ideal and perfect scenario that shatters. Only plundering, only treacherous acts remain. He kills the love that won't stay and trades it for a castle that can only be guarded in place.Crazy love, crazy infatuation. I wonder, what if Felix forgives? What if he responds to this love?This is a direction untouched by both ""Genius Loci"" and this movie, and a direction that could never be explored. If it did, it might turn into... an original BL story?Haha.","

Oooohhh no it's not a comedy, it's a drama with a silent dy.Yes he's intense, Yes he can act, but he has zero charisma. Nothing that can keep me entertained or keep watching. He seems like he'd suck the fun out of everything in real life and his plasticine face just irks me too.Jacob Elordi on the other hand seems very comfortable in his role.. almost like he isn't acting and seems incredibly posh. As someone else has mentioned this does seem to be ""posh propaganda"".Farleigh might be the only relatable character in this but his character isnt relatable because he's awful.As to the story - it's soooooo old hat I had to keep reminding myself that this was released in 2023. Brideshead and the talented Mr Ripley are as close in their DNA to this that rather than being twins, they're actually clones.Will not be watching this again.","

Saltburn," Literally a ""Mr Ripley"" rip-off
",Remy_Azhary,30-Dec-23,"I was wondering what the fuss was about. But then again, they obviously had not seen The Talented Mr Ripley. Basically the same premise. A nobody weaving himself into the lives of the wealthy.While Barry Keoghan is a gifted actor his only shines in showcasing the erotic thriller aspect of his character. But that's actually a good thing.It's just that he probably could very well do some other movies to showcase that range of his but not this one.As for the cast, they could very well be done by unknowns. Speaking of which, with an actor like Carey Mulligan she deserves more screen time. Yet her role was in just a few scenes then she's gone. Jacob Elordi, too, could do something bigger especially with his name on the rise.Like I said, the movie is not something that had not been done before. It's just flashy and posh.Before watching this, I was hoping that there could be something actually happening between the Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi.

Saltburn," let's talk about it
",SnoopyStyle,28-Dec-23,"It's 2006. Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is an outsider nerd in Oxford University. Most of the other students seem to be upper-crust from the cool kids' table. The head of that table is Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). Oliver works to befriend Felix who invites Oliver to his family's estate called Saltburn to join his parents (Richard E. Grant, Rosamund Pike), his sister Venetia (Alison Oliver), his less-well-off cousin Farleigh Start (Archie Madekwe), and Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan).This is Emerald Fennell's second directorial full length theatrical movie. She hit the first one out of the park with the critics and everybody is expecting a lot from her. I love this one more than ""Promising Young Woman"". That seems to be a minority opinion. Certainly, the style and the daring and the edge are all right there in both movies. In this one, I'm not questioning the reality of the situation.It all boils down to Barry Keoghan. His eyes are so unique. He looks both innocent and like a serial killer. From the beginning, I am assuming that he is inject little lies to get into the inner circle. I just couldn't understand his feelings for Felix. That's why I love his final explanation of both loving and hating him. I thought he had a misstep dealing with Venetia. He should have neg her by saying she failed his demand to eat. That would have kept her wrapped around his finger. The movie's biggest misstep is the section with the reveals. The first reveal of the bicycle tire is great. The money at the bar is interesting, but it's not that surprising. At the time, the audience thought he's poor, but by the end, we know he has middle class money. The Farleigh reveal is no reveal. Anybody with a brain knows what happened. The Felix reveal is only interesting in its details. The Venetia reveal is problematic in that her suicide needs to be expanded right away. By then, the audience knows Oliver is doing the killings. As for Elspeth, I would have prefer a marriage first and that murder is too blatant. The whole last act is a bit of a stumble, but I do love the rest.","

We all wake up thinking we are wonderful all the time. Not.Barry Keoghan specifically pours out his whole soul into the character Oliver. I don't think anyone else could have done justice to the role.The entire cast open themselves up to places and moments that shamelessly mirror humanity and its worst and its best.It is sexy too. Nice to see a movie when you walk out and the entire audience is abuzz in conversation about their community of experience, good or bad. Each viewer takes and gives to the film from their own perspective.Raunchy, funny, shocking, human are all words that are folded into these actors' understanding of the material they tore from the pages of the script and became.This film will be discussed for years to come and watched more than once by each viewer who ""gets it.""Adored.Kudos!","

",N-whymark,19-Nov-23,"Such a banger if a film . Had watched the trailer but deliberately did not read any reviews . Barry keoghan is one of the main actors who I think is fantastic and such a top class new talent. Richard e. Grant as well was great. A real mixture of giggles, shocks twists and turns which I never saw coming. A few gasps and hands over the eyes moments . I don't want to give any spoilers as I think it ruins the experience of the film . Set in a beautiful mansion house with fantastic scenery and filming . I would watch this again just to see if I pick anything up I missed the first time . Top class film , acting and plot.","

Saltburn," Visitor Q vs Funny Games =...
",EvalovesMovies,13-Jan-24,"If you loved visitor Q, you love this dark dark art movie. If you loved Funny Games, you'll love this one even more. It's a bit dull the first 20 minutes, but then something disturbing is happening and the story will suck you right in. I couldn't stop watching anymore, sometimes even had to look away of the deep embarrassment of some scenes, that are driven by a deep dark fantasy. And I had to laugh so much about the completely absurdism as well. And the end? Well it's not a big surprise, but nevertheless every single strangeness will fall into the right place. It's just a sick movie afterall but I definitely recommend it, if you like the dark places of humor.","

Saltburn," Overlong and poorly constructed
",neilanderson-96913,07-Jan-24,"Starts off interesting, but it soon becomes clear it's the old ""scholarship boy can't get accepted by the posh crowd"" trope.The idea is over-used. The movie is over-long. The editing is all over the place. There's so much staring into space and overly arty shots. The plot, when it remembers there's supposed to be one, is unlikely and poorly thought out. The characters are two dimensional and the ideas don't run.Despite some great performances, and cinematography there's little can save this. Possibly cutting an hour out of the finished version may have made it more watchable, but for me it was painfully slow, ridiculously stereotyped, impossibly flawed, and has several loose ends that never get tied up.","

Saltburn," Pretty Good Movie
",cinemapersonified,31-Oct-23,"Rating: 7.6
Overall, a bold attempt at a grand movie in Emerald Fennell's sophomore effort as she really builds the grand world of Saltburn through cinematography and production design and gets a lot out of her actors (especially Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi), but, in the end, is held back by having too many continuity issues/loose ends and going overboard with the more grotesque scenes.Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Controlled her scenes well on a macro-scale as she used the cinematography and the sets to tell how grandiose Saltburn was (and the dichotomy of how closed off everyone was because of it); Did a pretty good job on a micro scale as the one-on-one scenes were good (especially the ones between Keoghan and Elordi) but the group scenes were not that well executed; the storytelling is overall decent as the overarching story is encapsulated well but the movement between plot points is not as fluid as it could be (with there being some easily spotted continuity issues); Some scenes felt very elongated for no reason and were just really meant to shock rather than have any substance), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Barry Keoghan (Really captures the persona of this demented hero well as he shows the lengths the protagonist will go to get what he wants), Very Good from Jacob Elordi (Really uses his charisma and looks to help propel his performance as he really takes control of all the scenes he is in to act as this heavenly god that the main character is trying to chase), Good to Very Good from Rosamund Pike (Plays the dull/out-of-touch character well and has that elitist British tone that helps with her character), Good to Very Good from Richard E. Grant (Similiar to Pike in that he plays a dull/out-of-touch character well), Good from Alison Oliver (Has a lot of moments that are good as her character's emotional instability helps portray a young adolescent), Good from Archie Madekwe (Plays his character well and has good chemistry being at odds with Keoghan), Good from Carey Mulligan (More of a cameo appearance but does a good job in letting her presence be known), Good from the rest of the cast (Each actor plays their role well as they work off of the main cast)), Pretty Bad Story (The overarching story is interesting and has a lot of mystery to it as the director slowly peels at what is actually going on; the storytelling is not the best as there are a lot of continuity errors (like Superbad being played on DVD before it is even out in theaters) and is not that clear at points; the characters were written well and have their clear purpose in the story (with the mystery of the lead character helping drive the story forward); There were just the right amount of plot points (it just felt like some of the overall scenes could have been cut down a bit); the movie does not tie everything up well (and this hurts the story as it is not meant to really have things left open to interpretation)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue flowed very well and felt like it was of the time and the place; the symbolism is somewhat there but it does not help with portraying the message; the foreshadowing was good as it helped with showing who the main character really is (and was not that predictable)), Pretty Good Score/Good Soundtrack (really helped with setting the time), Incredible Cinematography (Really felt very grand and helped with showing how big and lost you can be in Saltburn), Bad Sound (The dialogue was not mixed well as a lot of times it was unclear what they were saying or the music was too loud that the dialogue just felt inaudible), Decent Editing (Overall was good and helped with showing how grand Saltburn was and how small the subjects were inside it; some of the scenes felt just unnecessarily long and could have been cut to provide the same effect (especially for the more grotesque scenes)), Great Production Design (The sets in Saltburn were just so grand and illustrious that they helped with showing the wealth the family had; the college sets were all very stunning as they helped show the history of the school; the party (and aftermath) was designed very well to just show how many people were there), Plot Structure was good as the points were laid out well and each overall component helped build to the next one (it is just inside of these components it did not feel like the story progressed well between scenes)runtime could have been cut down by making some of the scenes sorter as it would not have that much effect on the story (shaving maybe 5-10 minutes), Pacing was fine as it did not feel like it was too fast or slow, Climax was decently executed as it is presented in a very shocking way (but the more you think about it the more holes you see in the continuity), Tone was very similar to a coming-of-age mixed with a thriller and High-class British themes as this helps show the world the main character is living in, Saw a premiere at Austin Film Festival; the grotesque scenes were a bold choice but it does not pay off that well as it just makes the audience feel uneasy than actually showing how deranged some of the actions and characters were.","

",nabeach-15358,18-Nov-23,"Yes it mimics BR but without any of the class and character. The actors are by and large just props trying their best in a film that is too deep and unnecessarily pretentious. An art house film that fails in every area with too much swearing, smoking and homo erotic nudity. Why bother I ask myself. A real let down but in the hands of another director it could have been good with more focus and less dark side which gave nothing to people like me. Think of all the money on the budget though. A complete waste of 2 hours, shame.None of the characters seem to claim the attention, somewhat distracted and aware they are acting which is a fail in my eyes.

Saltburn," Lazy writing creates a smug, self-satisfied mess
",Reefmonkey,03-Jan-24,"A talented cast including Richard E. Grant, Rosamund Pike, and Carey Mulligan was wasted on a terrible script with clunky dialogue and a half-baked meandering plot that runs out of steam in the third act. Anyone who has seen ""The Talented Mr. Ripely"" will guess that Oliver will ingratiate himself with Felix, become obsessed with him, do something that weirds him out, and kill him, all in the first 5 minutes of the film. As soon as you see Oliver looking at the hedge maze you know that's where he will kill Felix. As soon as Felix tells Oliver he has a ""surprise"" for his birthday, a ""road trip"", you know he's going to take him to see his mother, you know she'll turn out to be perfectly nice and not an addict, and that Dad's actually alive and a responsible citizen, too. And once Venetia starts calling Oliver out after Felix's funeral, you know she's going to die. Then the supposed ""twist"" at the end is so clumsily set up that it makes M Night Shyamalan's forced, formulaic plot twists look like freaking Hitchcock. It's incredibly unbelievable. Oliver saw Felix at Oxford, just knew if he punctured Felix's bicycle tire and then lent him his while pretending to be poor and awkward and pitiable, Felix would take him under his wing, invite him to his country manor house so Oliver could manipulate the foilbles he just knew Felix's gentry family would have, kill them off one by one until he could manipulate the bereaved matriarch into signing over the whole estate to him, which was as legally implausible as it was logically implausible (good thing for Ollie wealthy titled socially connected families never have cadet branches that might have something to say about some nobody popping up and having control of the estate signed over to him after three closely timed untimely deaths).And just as there is no rhyme or reason why even the most brilliant mastermind should think that such a far fetched plan that involves passively hoping multiple variables outside his control come to pass, there is also no plausible explanation given for why Oliver should choose to target this family. He supposedly loved Felix until Felix got creeped out by his lies (back to the Talented Mr Ripley rehash), but even before his lies about his parents were discovered, he was screwing Venetia and the Farleigh for reasons that don't seem to serve his machinations or plot or character development and would threaten his chances with Felix. Then it is he hated Felix, the one guy at Oxford who was kind and accepting of him unconditionally. Some class warfare motivation is implied, the poor kid (checks notes) scratch that, comfortably middle class kid envíes rich kid (yawn). And then there is the implication maybe Oliver did all this just because he's a sociopath, which is a lazy cop out. It's like in a bizarre case of alternative pleading as plot development, director/screenwriter Fannell is throwing character motivation options against the wall like so much undercooked pasta to see what sticks.And Oliver is not the only character who is poorly fleshed out. The Farleigh character is well acted and succeeds in making the audience hate him, but Oliver is so over the top creepy and cringy that Farleigh's douchebaggery towards him does practically nothing to build audience empathy for Oliver. And the way Oliver is able to get Farleigh disowned so easily by revealing his coke use is as anticlimactic as it is unbelievable. Carey Mulligan's character is so one dimensional, and barely there before she's unceremoniously killed offscreen with no impact on the characters or the audience that you wonder why Fannell bothered to cast a name actor like Mulligan in the role at all. Richard E Grant is the slightly dotty hereditary member of the leisure class, a tired stock character, as is Rosamund Pike's facilely effusive but actually flinty upper class British woman character, as is Venetia's poor little rich girl/wild child.A a psychological thriller this movie is a failure. As a social satire this movie is a failure. As an absurdist black comedy this movie is a failure. It only serves to make the audience uncomfortable for 2 hours while failing to deliver a payoff in either humor or smart ploy list or incisive commentary that would make that discomfort worth it in the end.","

",JBLOSS,08-Jan-24,"Saltburn has got a lot of noise and publicity around it and indeed it looks good but after that not much can be said in its favour.. Fundamentally it's pretty derivative, the characters are quite thin and need fleshing out with the main protagonists relationship being utterly unbelievable. There is just no good reason why they become ""friends"". Indeed the plot takes a few contrived twists that don't really bear up to any close scrutiny before the film ends with a 2 minute explanation of the plot for anyone who wasn't paying attention or couldn't infer anything. This feels like it's poor compensation for the deficiencies in the filmmaking itself. The writing seems half baked and nobody took a critical step back to say this is just nonsense, albeit glossy nonsense.","

Saltburn," Batting against a window
",TheDragonTrader,12-Jan-24,"You can trust a boy searching for himself to let his experiments become outlandish. The knockout imagery and obvious soundtrack catch us in a thirst trap with the protagonist. There is no place for love at Saltburn, only lust.Barry Keoghan delivers Oliver as a loner driven by his boner for Jacob Elordi's character Felix. Meanwhile, Elordi is exquisite as the unreachable straight boy who keeps giving off vibes of wider sympathies but ultimately conforms to the conservative attraction of his masculine aura. There is longing and frustration between them as neither dare speak of their feelings.The aspect ratio encases every character in their superficiality. At Saltburn, people are mere puppets, you can buy your friends, and feelings are violently constrained. Even at the direst moments, Oliver must comply with formality while others escape in alcohol or pleasantries. The result is both gruesome and hilarious.There is a parable hidden in there somewhere: about how money - or beauty - exists to increase the suffering of whomever owns it or how the deepest feelings are the hardest to say out loud. The way Oliver is batting against a window - like a moth that can't get to the flame - is telling.But the finale breaks both character and plot. The incentive was not with whom we thought it was - cliché. Some jokes border on the inappropriate, and some characters vanish without impact. You can also spot great foreshadowing for little more than a side note.When the credits roll, there is no meaning left.","

Saltburn," Declined Review for Unknown Reason
",akoaytao1234,30-Dec-23,"Saltburn tells the story of how a man infiltrated a gentile upper class family and made their world go upside down. From entering Oxford and meeting the family's only son. He slowly crawls his way into the clasp of the family and charms his way in.Probably this year's 'Babylon', the film's inversion of the eat the rich concept just does not work. Like Babylon, it has a lot of problems.The characterization here is lacking. No one here feels like you know them by the end of the film. Even with a lot twitter clippings of quotes, it never really say much about the character. It shows their disposition BUT in the end, they felt so hallow. Even Keoghan's character is so empty and contradictory. He wants to be accepted and take it all but why? Loved, and Loved him, he say mockingly towards the end. EMPTY NOISES. You never really see any POV of the main characters true self.Then the biggest and probably most jarring is the commentary the film implies. That the poor and the middle class are 'biting the hand' of the gentile elites. The cousin, the the other scholar, the teacher and (ultimately) Keoghan's character are only shown almost at the mercy of the rich AND are ultimately at their predisposal, which was shockingly icky. Here's where the lack of POV or characterization made it even worse. Talented Mr Ripley works because you know from the get go that he wants to be rich and the rich character actually shows what he thinks of him(BUT the ending is awful). Teorema works because the Keoghan character is a foil for change for the elite - good or bad. Here, the Keoghan is indicted AND he has nothing but 'the implication' to stand on. There is no real reason for him to do it nor any POV from for the Saltburn peeps for him to have that reaction.Interesting watch. I could see a way to enjoy it (by seeing as a empty forgettable thriller) BUT THE IMPLICATIONS I fear is far too much.","

Saltburn," Wasted Time...
",KFstudios2009,03-Jan-24,"Saltburn is one of the most confusing storylines ever. The plot doesn't stick together and doesn't make sense at all. Everything starts with a boy with a hidden secret that he's gay. Then he's not, then he is, and suddenly something different happens. You know, it's nothing in the plot that you can connect to or feel concerned about, until the end. The end concludes the story, and everything makes suddenly sense. But the previous hour and forty minutes, doesn't. The main character (That is either protagonist or antagonist, not sure) is not likable, even if they tried to make you like him. The audience is supposed to be concerned about him, but the plastic acting, expressions and the character development that nobody gives a damn about doesn't fix the situation either. His ""love"" connection with his friend is showed as a thing that comes in and out of the film, something that's sometimes is very important, while other times they focused on something way different. They waste time on long unnecessary scenes that doesn't change the course of action at all. They even put in some scenes to express our main hero some more, but I interpreted it in a bad way. If I separate the film in three parts, then I would say a confusing beginning, boring middle and a dull, yet understandable ending. Two stars for ok pictures and scenography, and an ending that finally concludes this boring story. The music was decent, it fit the film, but not a technical that I got really impressed about. In the end, Saltburn was not a good film, a huge waste of time, forgettable, I don't even think you should take a peak on it.","

Saltburn," 6/10. Watchable but not recommended
",athanasiosze,07-Jan-24,"It's not easy to rate this. There were things i liked but overall, it's deeply flawed.1) Its running time was not a problem. This is a 130 minutes movie but it never got boring. It was interesting all the way, but if something is interesting, it doesn't mean it's good too. An accident is an interesting thing, people might peep as they are passing by. But still, accidents are not something nice. At times, this movie is like an accident on a highway. It's catching the eye and you can't look the other way. But still you don't like what you see.2) There are great actors here. However the script didn't help them. For example, Rosamund Pike's character is not well written. She does the best possible acting but her lines were weird and awkward. Especially the things she did during the last 30-ish minutes. I won't spoil this but the last 30 minutes half ruined this movie. Not just Pike's character. Shocking for shock's sake. The grave scene -you'll know if you see it- is comically abhorrent. If you are 20 years old, maybe the wholw ending would look impressive and brilliant to you. If you get older, you are gonna laugh due to its stupidity.3) Barry Keoghan is a great actor, too. But he can't carry a movie like this on his shoulders. He is talented but not charismatic. It's not his fault of course that someone thought he is capable to pull a ""Pasolini's Theorem"" remake (not exactly but close) with him as the leading character. He was not convincing even though he tried hard. He is thrilling in many movies. But he is not as gifted as this role demands.4) THEOREM aside, this is so derivative it hurts. I won't mention another movies but this is so copycat that it ends up having no identity. This is a hollow and empty movie. So uninspired that it looks like an unintentional parody. This director's previous movie was very good ( PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN). SALTBURN is not.5) Having said that, i'll still give it six stars because at times, i thought this gonna be good. It tricked me and i'll give it some points because of that. It was a fun ride and there were many intense scenes. Usually, i hate it when there is not a single likeable character in a movie, but i didn't care about it here. It was a bit intriguing, i couldn't guess where it goes, during the first 90 minutes. I think there is a good movie inside this movie. It should be more ""polished"" and classy, it should have a voice of its own instead of being a copy. Unfortunately, this is kinda ""cheap"" and tasteless. But still i would have rated it higher if the ending was not so disastrous.","

Saltburn," Wannabe talented Mr Ripley.
",deleyshaun,25-Dec-23,"Saltburn is kind of a messed up gothic play on the far superior "" The talented Mr Ripley"". There is a lot of excess and lavish cinematography for not much payoff. It's just there for the sake of it. The leads are fine but it's not Jude Law and Matt Damon. The central character played by Barry Keoghan simply doesn't have the acting chops to pull off the protagonists cunning in a way that you believe it. He is apt at best. Better actors- Carey mulligan and to a lesser extent Rosamund Pike are not utilised that well. The movie tries to be smart and stylish - it fails the smart test and the stylish is replaced for substance. This generally never bodes well for a film. The final denouement - which is the highlight of the film comes in the last 10 mins. But is it worth the two hour wait? Not for me.","

Saltburn," Twisted, grotesque but immersive.
",cgeer-82876,14-Jan-24,"Yes, we've been here before with the likes of Brideshead Revisited et all, but this kept me watching right up until the last shot, albeit from behind the cushions at times. The acting is on the money apart from a couple of scenes, but the casting was inspired. Mr Grant, whilst not being given a huge amount of screen time, was excellent, as was Ms Pyke, but Keoghan stole the show. As the darkness bagan to make itself known, you are dragged along with it but what a ride. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like it but it totally got me hooked. Also, I have to mention that the portrayal of the moneyed classes at their very worst rings very true indeed. Well worth watching!","

Saltburn," Not good
",seraichyk,24-Dec-23,"Reading some of the reviews and hearing that this got 3 critics choice awards... I'm sooo confused. The ""gross"" parts didn't phase me at all..I just found the movie to be frustrating. I love the basic premise, but I'd say 80% of the movie was just dull. The set up for the activity, just took forever. Much of the dialogue and acting was just awkward and not good. I can think of several movies with a similar story (evil sociopath who at first seems innocuous..), which were engaging, entertaining, exciting... Because I don't understand the intricacies of movie making, I can't pinpoint what this movie was lacking. For me it was something very ominous.I was going to watch it at a movie theater, but before I got a chance it was available to stream at home. About 45-60 minutes in, I felt like the movie was already failing in that it just wasn't engaging. I thought, well maybe if the big plot reveal is good enough, it will compensate for all this wasted time...nope. Even that was clumsy and not exciting.Maybe those who loved this, found it so aesthetically pleasing and/or clever in its caricature of the rich... that they forgot there should be a cohesive, interesting story. I really wanted to like it. 😔","

Saltburn," Disgustingly Great
",kjproulx,05-Jan-24,"Emerald Fennell is a filmmaker whom I said I would be eagerly awaiting her next film ever since her feature film directorial debut with Promising Young Woman. She was put on the map when her film received multiple Oscar nominations, including a win. I thought that film was great, so there was no chance I was missing out on her latest, Saltburn. After viewing it, all I can say is wow. I'm still comprehending it all, but it sure was quite the experience. Saltburn is probably for a very small number of people, but the gross nature of the film and the filmmaking itself is far too good to look away. I'm sure some viewers will think I'm crazy for liking this film as much as I did, but here's why.The premise is fairly simple. Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) becomes very close to his classmate at Oxford University, Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). During the summer break, Felix invites Oliver to his family home, a mansion filled with a few, very interesting characters. I don't want to ruin the film, so I'll leave the premise at that, but this is one crazy, sadistic, disgusting, and wild summer that the film explores. This is a role that Keoghan was born to play as well because he just let himself embody this character like there was no tomorrow. He gives a terrific performance here, but he portrays a character I hope I never have to be around.Alison Oliver is great as Felix's sister Venetia and Elordi himself does some of his best work yet, but Archie Madekwe is becoming an actor I can't wait to continue watching. His portrayal of Farleigh Start was one of the highlights of the film. The best friend of Felix, who is also kind of the one who is the outsider. His character was almost the glue this film needed to thread everything together. I took notice of him earlier this year in Gran Turismo (which is a film that I believe is underrated and more people should watch) and I think we may just see him explode shortly. His talents seem to be going under the radar right now.Aside from all the great performances, I kind of already praised the direction, but Emerald Fennell does a stellar job here. Linus Sandgren is one of the biggest stars of this film though. His cinematography here is perfect. With not many different set pieces, he utilizes every bit of it that he can. The framework here astonished me. For such a small scale, it feels bigger than it is. I also hope that Victoria Boydell gets some recognition for the editing work here. A dinner scene in particular stands out to me, as a camera is on each of the characters and not one emotion is missed. I thought that scene in particular was cut together.Saltburn is a film that goes for it in every way that it wants to. How Emerald Fennell even came up with some of the ideas in this film is beyond me and will likely make half of the viewers turn the film off, but I was so engaged that I just went with it. I couldn't believe some of the things I was watching Oliver do, but I believe that was the point. I can't stress enough that this is a hard one to recommend to many people, but I will still say that I loved it. The ending is also satisfying if it's a film you enjoy from beginning to end. Now available to stream on Prime Video, do with this review what you will.","

But why? Was his goal just wealth? Originally it felt as if he was in love with the tall cute felix the cat which was understandable. But it went back and forth with that as well.Also the setting was all wrong but it would be a complete ripley rip off is she placed it in a more accurate period. I mean yeah. They didn't have Instagram in 2006 but if you googled a name, some info would pop up.Mediocre and too long. As always, Rosamund Pike and Carey were dreamy. They both deserve nominations. Carey was so good I would watch a spin off.","

Saltburn," Some pacing issues here.
",Mr_Sophistication_Uk,07-Jan-24,"This is one long film at more than two hours, and I'm not sure the content quite justifies the length. As you no doubt know by now, it's about a seemingly normal everyday youth intruding on an aristocratic family during his University break, and the effect he has on their lives during 'one unforgettable summer', as Amazon describes it. Hmm.There are quite a lot of scenes here that initially seem interesting but outstay their welcome, and a few cringe moments in term of sexual content I could've done without. The acting is universally good and everything escalates rather fast to tie together nicely in the end... I'm just not sure I'd see it a second time, that's all.Oh, and if you're wondering why 'Murder On The Dancefloor' is currently climbing the charts, it's because of the climax where the main actor Barry Keoghan... well, that would be telling, but sufficed to say it all seemed a bit unnecessary to me.And if you really wanted to stream the song based on this movie... I don't even know what to say to that. 6/10.","

",melanie-carter,04-Feb-24,"Let me start by saying that I don't 'do' arty, pretentious and definitely not Gothic films. All of which were how this was described to me, none of which were true.I want my Saturday nights to be entertaining and relaxing but a trusted family member told me to watch it and 'Promising Young Woman' by the same director is in my all time top 20 so I gave it a go.Easy to watch, entertaining and in some places incredibly funny, this is a stunning film.The acting is superb but the direction is on another level. So much work (and thought) must have gone into every detail with minute clues all the way through that were there if you watched it closely. Seemingly small nuances in both the dialogue and the visual scenes were immaculately thought out and just this side of believable.The sex scenes, whilst uncomfortable to watch, were, I thought not only essential to the story but also incredibly brave to include.I can almost picture the production team saying 'Dare we? Yes, let's do it'

Saltburn," Flatulent degeneracy masquerading as arthouse drama.
",richiewilcox,07-Jan-24,"Set in the nostalgic mid-2000's, Saltburn follows a quiet but sinister student called Oliver (played by Barry Keoghan, at his most creepy) who ingratiates himself into his posh friend's aristocratic family, with questionable motives.Over the course of the film, Oliver morphs into a vampiric sociopath, growing on this family like a tumour, as the film tries to ham-fistedly explore themes of jealousy, lust and social inequity.The tumour analogy is also apt, because watching this film was about as comfortable as a colorectal exam. What follows for two excruciating hours is a long-winded attempt at a dark-humoured drama, where we meet gaggle of unlikeable, two-dimensional toffs who are slowly exploited by creepy little Oliver. To maintain the audience's attention, these encounters are then interspersed with (what else?) gratuitous, feral sex scenes, purely for shock value.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, herself a wealthy heiress who undoubtedly made it in Hollywood thanks to her social privilege, her attempts to explore these themes of class and envy fall completely flat, especially if you contextualise the them through her gaze. The irony here is really astounding.Like Fennell's first film, Promising Young Woman, which won a sympathy Oscar due to its topical (but superficial) exposé of an important narrative, this too was an unimaginative attempt of a worthwhile subject where nothing worthwhile was actually said. Fennell again is out of her depth, despite her results being only puddle-deep. The end result seemed more like a series of quirky vignettes featuring disdainful a******es, stitched together to form a slow and pretentious melodrama.In fairness to Fennell, the cinematography and soundtrack are both vivid and catchy. Fennell's 'vibe' and visual instinct would be perfect for a raunchy music video; she could even be described as a reasonable director in a such a role. But with Saltburn, her writing (and the movie's social media marketing) is aligned towards this new TikTok generation: vulgar, debased, and playing up to the soundbite-loving, shock-valued meme culture.Nothing of substance was made here.If you want dark-humoured social commentary, see Parasite. If you want sordid absurdity (with awkward sex scenes that actually benefit the plot!), see Dogtooth. And if you have completely lost touch with reality and think this movie is any way a piece of avant-garde artistry, I suggest you take a walk outside and remind yourself what a tree looks like.","

",mbell-56214,31-Dec-23,"Heard a lot of hype around this movie, but honestly I only managed 45 minutes of this drivel before I turned it off.I read the writer/director filmed it in the ratio because she thought it would give the audience the view of someone peaking in. But all it did for me was make it look very old fashioned, so much so that the time setting of the early 2000's just felt completely wrong. It had the look and feel of a movie from the 60's. At just over two hours long I would expect to be hooked by the movie within half an hour, but there was nothing to hold my attention after 45 mins, no build up, drama, suspense, comedy or anything else. Such a waste of some decent talented actors.","

Saltburn," Style, but no substance....
",brockfal,02-Jan-24,"Fennel's 'Promising young woman' was an exciting surprising and entertaining debut, so I had high hopes for 'Saltburn'. The film certainly has got attitude and a certain off centre style, but ultimately I didn't think it had any real substance, being a sort of rehash of 'Brideshead Revisited' punk or modern style, however, without proper conviction and purpose and hardly any sense of authenticity. After all, 'Brideshead'was very much a product of its time, particularly of the class system of early 20th century Britain.It was great to see Barry Keoghan again, and there's plenty of other talent on show, but for me this was not impressive.","

Saltburn," Certainly not a comedy, nor a thriller, but for sure a good drama.
",deloudelouvain,02-Feb-24,"This movie has been well promoted, talked about due to some disturbing scenes although I found those explicit scenes not that choking. Sure a couple scenes were gross but it's passable, we've all seen worse. Saltburn is categorized as a comedy, drama and thriller. A bit foolish if you ask me. It's for sure not a comedy, or maybe I didn't get the humour. I wouldn't call it a thriller either, maybe for the last five minutes, but it was quite predictable what happened. A drama it is for sure, but that's the genre that is least appealing to me. A good drama though, and that's all due to the excellent acting of the cast. Barry Keoghan and Rosemund Pike got nominated for the Golden Globes, which I get as they were on top. Jacob Elordi was also very good in my opinion. The reason I only give it a six is that a six means a good movie to me, one that I enjoyed watching but that I don't need or will watch again in the future. But for people that are into dramas it's certainly a movie that will score higher to them. I was just hoping for more suspense and thrilling.","

There were so many cringe moments but I couldn't look away. It's unbelievable the performance Barry provides.Bravo to the writer and Director, who she also created Killing Eve. I'm so happy to see someone finally take a risk in providing arefreshing unique daring movie. I haven't seen a movie this effective and one that continues to push the envelope.Someone said a rip off of the talented Mr Ripley. I feel bad for that person because they watched the wrong movie. Watch it! Experience this! And let yourself to continue to think about it for a couple of days or rewatach it. This is perfect. I personally believe Barry deserves the Oscar and that's saying A LOT! Even if he doesn't win, which he won't, he still shook the whole industry up making himself the best actor of his generation. I can't imagine how good this kid is going to get. From Killing of the sacred deer (watch it after Saltburn because it will fill that void bc you're going to watch something even more risking taking at the peak of PC culture in 2017).I think it's worth a comparison and it's worth also noting how many great actors and directors he's worked with so early in his career. Yorgos, Nolan, Emerald et cetera.Enjoy this experience because these movies are rare.","

Saltburn," Intriguing character study of British classes with silly ending
",lauralmacleod,31-Jan-24,Believe it or not to those viewers who may think this storyline of characters is farcical; these characters do exist in Britain in many shapes and forms and it sure ain't pretty. Emerald F does come from the British upper class herself and so she will be creating this Saltburn symbolism from personal experience. In the first half of the film the storyline may be slightly far fetched but the themes are plausible and very interesting. Plus there is humour and wit. As the film progresses with the climax of one of the main character's demise I was onboard. Then the film descends in a parody and I believe the cost was to be left out of any Oscar nominations. In short a step too far. The character played by Rosamund Pike (and I have met such types) would 100 % not fall in to the trickery of the main protagonist: money is their God not delusion. The ending was also a vanity project apparently it was not scripted and the director in spite of her many talents got seriously off track at that point.,"

",danielspink,13-Dec-23,"This film starts off well with a good cast and interesting premise. As things darken and begin to twist it handles things well with some OTT. Characterisation but still remains entertaining. Unfortunately once the main reveal happens it then continues to hit the viewer over the head with a hammer constantly and the ending and subsequent explanation seemed twice as long as it needed to be and brutally patronising. Shame, with more sublety was promising and worked like a decent enough horror / class commentary film. Not a film you are likely to forget, just not for all the right reasons. Weak female and secondary characters didn't help, although the main character is pretty androgynous. The sister ( or one of the servants) could have been so much more interesting and been a good saviour near the end. Not sure why we needed the last scene and if this is a class commentary, what about the servants at the end? After watching with a friend who hadn't seen Withnail and I, decided it to be a much better proposition.","

Saltburn," Peculiarly entrancing, off kilter dark comedy
",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,08-Feb-24,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulOliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is a young man from the north, who arrives at Oxford University, and is a complete fish out of water. Ostracised by his fellow students, and seen as unduly studious, even by his tutors. By a chance encounter with a flat tire on a bike, he strikes up a friendship with Felix (Jacob Elondi), the most popular guy at the place, from an upper class background out in the sticks. Oliver finds himself drawn into Felix's wild world of excess and privilege, but all may not be as it seems.This Amazon Prime release has certainly garnered something of a word of mouth cult status at the moment, not least for causing a resurgence in popularity of Sophie Ellis Bextor's 2001 hit Murder on the Dance Floor. Writer/director Emerald Fennell has drawn on her upper class background, and created a host of eccentric and wild characters that (presumably) well reflect that world. What matters is that they're entertaining, and play an important part in propelling the story forward. And here, they and the story just about do. Just about.After some standard social awkwardness comedy/drama at the beginning, it quickly becomes about the central relationship between the two central characters, which is quietly engaging, but largely dull and uneventful, with an overload of niceness and amiable chit chat between the pair that doesn't really go anywhere, or really liven things up in any way, even in spite of all the wild goings on. It only really gets interesting when it becomes clear that something's amiss, and then the big twist comes, which is admittedly unexpected and startling, making the second act more of a pay off than the first.Performances wise, Keoghan and Elordi have an awkward chemistry in their respective lead roles, whilst supporting performers Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant ham it up as the upper class, eccentric parents. It's a curious, offbeat piece, wickedly funny, just about paying off if you can get over the lethargy of the first act. ***","

Saltburn," A Gorgeous and Baffling Mess
",bardmore,24-Dec-23,"Saltburn is mesmerizingly incomprehensible and utterly pretentious. Its most intriguing quality is attempting to make sense of its dizzyingly absurd and unbelievable plot. The mere mention of the incomparable Brideshead Revisited in the same breath is near blasphemy. The characters are devoid of any dimension and lack motivation in their robotic machinations. Some scenes are slow and agonizingly long, while some scenes that have a whiff of emotion, such as when Oliver and Felix go to Oliver's parents, are frustratingly cut short of development and resolution. Moreover, Barry Keoghan as super Oxford student is about as convincing as Elizabeth Warren's assertion that she is a Cherokee Indian. Thankfully there is Jacob Elordi whose raffish good looks and spirited performance, as well as that of Rosalind Pike., bring much needed relief to the absurd proceedings. On the plus side are the gorgeous settings and frequently beautiful music, but nonetheless they are not enough to make up for the mind-numbing script. And that last scene!!!

Saltburn," Very Few Redeeming Qualities
",willphelan,04-Jan-24,I did not like Saltburn at all. The movie is very boring and the story isn't engaging. The story is an ok character study but it's not very well written. It's predictable and cliche. The acting and directing here is good but it didn't help me enjoy the movie. The film is also very disturbing and not in a good way in my opinion. I just felt disgusted watching the movie and not in a way that I found it interesting. It was just weird. There weren't any scenes or characters that stood out to me either. Overall it's a pretty well made movie from a technical perspective but it's not one that made me think or one that I had any enjoyment with. 3/10.,"

Saltburn," What was all the fuss about?
",craig-fraser87,10-Jan-24,"The acting is good, no complaints there, but the film itself is just weird in a sick and disturbing way.If this movie didn't have the shock moments then it would be an absolute bore fest. No one gains anything from moments where that make you look away from the screen in disgust and feeling sick.The end of the movie is just interesting but just makes me feel so disappointed in the rest or the movie. There were points in this movie where it could have been excellent and gone down routes to make a fascinating story but nope...it entered weirdville and got stranger and stranger.The artsy type will probably like this but it isn't a classic, far from it.","

Saltburn," Saltburn: A Depressing Descent into Tasteless Trash
",PedroReviews,30-Jan-24,"Prepare to be subjected to a barrage of pretentiousness, boredom, and gratuitously disturbing content in Saltburn, a film that fails spectacularly on every level. This pretentious, nonsensical, and disturbing film is a cinematic abomination that will leave you questioning the sanity of its creators and the critics who have showered it with praise.From the very first scene, you'll be bombarded by the film's overly stylized visuals and pretentious dialogue, which, in this case, is not just a gimmick but a deliberate attempt to mask the film's lack of substance. The 1.37:1 aspect ratio, reminiscent of classic films, is used as a crutch, not a tool, to elevate what is essentially a shallow and pretentious mess.The film's characters are a walking disaster zone, a collection of vapid and morally questionable individuals whose actions are as questionable as their motivations. Their dialogue is cringeworthy, their actions are nonsensical, and their overall presence is utterly repellent. You'll find yourself struggling to identify with any of them, let alone care about their lives.The plot, if you can call it that, is a convoluted mess of twists and turns that serve no purpose but to confuse and disgust. The film tries to be edgy and suspenseful, but it's just plain gross and exploitative. You'll find yourself squirming in your seat as you witness the characters engage in their endless stream of pretentious conversations, over-the-top dramatics, and graphic, disturbing scenes.Saltburn's attempts to be ""edgy"" and ""shocking"" with its gratuitously explicit content and morally reprehensible characters only make it more unbearable. It's as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to shock and offend, but they failed miserably.Saltburn is a prime example of how style can't compensate for a complete lack of taste and substance. The film is visually unappealing, the characters are utterly forgettable, and the plot is a nonsensical mess. If you're looking for an engaging and entertaining film, steer clear of Saltburn. You're better off watching paint dry.","

Saltburn," When you're this salty, someone's bound to get burned.
",Pjtaylor-96-138044,21-Nov-23,"'Saltburn (2023)' is an incredibly horny movie. It's easily one of the most bisexual films I've seen at the cinema, with a down-bad lead who seemingly wants to have sex with everyone he meets and cinematography that frames the characters as if any of them could start making out with one another at any given moment. Seriously, it's as if the camera operators themselves want to get in on the action. Pretty much every major player - Jacob Elordi's Felix, in particular - is shot with a sweaty sexuality that lends them an almost ethereal allure. It's like they're actively trying to seduce you through the screen, which the picture itself is attempting in its own way. The female gaze doesn't really exist, but if it did it would look like this; I finally know something about what it must feel like for a straight woman to watch, well, practically anything with a 'sexy' female character in it. At a certain point, the sexual tension snaps with a series of unashamedly shocking, near gross-out gags involving various bodily fluids and unexpected sex acts. The audience I was watching this with were audibly squirming in their seats at some of the more outrageous moments, and perhaps rightfully so. These are undoubtedly the moments which have caused many people to declare the back half of this ""really weird"", and they do kind of come out of nowhere - if not in their inclusion then in their perceived depravity. However, I don't think the second half of the flick is any less successful than the first, and it actually feels like a fairly natural progression of the plot. It's unorthodox, sure, and it starts to sew the first seeds in your mind that maybe the protagonist isn't quite as innocent as he first appears. The general subversiveness of the story does go quite a long way in keeping you invested, as you're never quite sure what's going to happen next or what the characters are actually thinking (or if they're even thinking at all). There's something off about everything at Saltburn from the moment it's introduced, and the flick builds this underlying sense of suspense that kind of sneaks up on you. Even if its ultimate reveal is handled fairly clumsily, most of the narrative is compelling enough to mostly justify the 130-minute runtime. It helps that the performances are all rock solid, including some expectedly fantastic work from Barry Keoghan, and that the writing keenly balances dark absurdism with disturbing satire. The cinematography has an appealing almost polaroid - or perhaps 8mm home movie - feel thanks to its 4:3 framing and notable film grain. The film is comprised almost exclusively of interestingly framed, often downright beautiful shots that frequently make perfect use of silhouette and satisfyingly unconventional composition. It's all edited together in a notably excellent fashion, featuring some bracingly vibrant montages that make use of repeated motifs to recontextualise previously seen material. It's a really well-made movie overall, and its narrative is more consistent than a lot of people seem to think. It does get ever-so-slightly repetitive in its midsection and some of its first act could arguably be trimmed, but it's a consistently engaging and darkly funny / funnily dark experience for most of its duration. The ending is a little inelegant, the theming isn't particularly deep and some of its more outlandish moments feel crafted almost solely for shock value, but this is a solid and unconventional feature that almost defies genre and is all the better for it.","

Saltburn," Promising but ultimately dumb
",ranprieur,13-Jan-24,"I went into this knowing nothing, and at one point it reminded me of Jordan Peele's Get Out, and also Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract: A guy goes to stay with some very rich people, and the atmosphere is bizarre and creepy.The early part of the film is promising, and the middle is quite good. The social subtext is subtle and cutting, the characters are well defined and well acted, and I had no idea what kind of movie it would turn into.Where it goes after that is just kind of trashy and unsatisfying. This kind of thing has been done better in movies that I can't name without a spoiler. And in hindsight, the protagonist is the least believable character, and even the other characters do some implausible things to serve the plot.","

Saltburn," The twist at the end saved it, and its artistic quality.
",SPZMaxinema,04-Feb-24,"Many people said that this movie was disturbing, but in my opinion it wasn't that bad in that way. I think the main problems with the film are that it's hard to actually care that much about the characters and it comes across as slow and boring much of the time. When I had watched 53 minutes of it, it felt like it was twice as long as that. Plus, Barry Keoghan is very ugly and unappealing to me and doesn't have any unique talent as an actor that makes him stand out. He's a little overrated. However, the movie had good directing and artistic imagery that added a lot of fine quality to it. Plus the twists at the end I was not expecting and I'm glad that they made the movie better by the end.","

",andrewchristianjr,24-Dec-23,"Weirdly and disgustingly amazing, acting and dramatic tensions are great, some scenes were definitely weird but Barry Keoghan is brilliant in this.Synopsis:
Academy Award winning filmmaker Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman) brings us a beautifully wicked tale of privilege and desire. Struggling to find his place at Oxford University, student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) finds himself drawn into the world of the charming and aristocratic Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi), who invites him to Saltburn, his eccentric family's sprawling estate, for a summer never to be forgotten.Emerald Fennell's candy-coated and incisive Saltburn is a debauched jolt to the senses that will be invigorating for most.","

Saltburn," I believed Dumbo can fly...but this nonsense, I believed none of it
",j_smith_7,02-Jan-24,"There is a great deal that is wrong with this film to believe any of the nonsense which is presented to us from the very start. The trope of the working class boy in the guilded halls of academe is, by now, a well-worn path and has (perhaps) run its course given that university attendance is seen as all but mandatory nowadays for any 18 year old. That aside, it is in the total and utter failure to present even one character in this story which has even a scintilla of believability about them where the film totally fails.And I am not talking about the stereotype of the bumbling but brilliant professors; nor the oh-so-posh Greco named characters; nor even the (shall we call it?) satire of the ingenue out of his depth. Rather, it is the sheer (literally) bloody silliness of the story. Nothing, but nothing, is believable.It is, of course, up to whomsoever chooses to do so to make the decision to go and see this expensively produced nonsense. I would not presume. But, had I known just how utterly nonsensical the whole thing turned out to be, I would have rented Disney's Dumbo and watched that again, as that film has far more credulity than this waste of time.I hope the wasted talent of Barry Keoghan in this film does not affect his career, as he is a great young actor (The Banshees of Inisherin, and the really gripping Calm With Horses show his skills briliantly).Poor show. Poor film.","

",vladmods,29-Dec-23,"""Saltburn"" is another ridiculous play on the ""rich people live a sick life"" which is pretty amusing given the fact that it is made by people who are quite rich. Insert some shocking scenes, add some degeneracy of the highest order, use a lot of actors to play repulsive people, resort to nudity for no apparent reason etc. All in all, the film wants to present the audience with a window to what some people think rich people believe and act upon.This is one of those movies which makes one contemplate the careers choices some of these actors make.

I'm not sure if Saltburn will be part of the nominations but it should be - for set design along with some astonishing performances.

I have not been so underwhelmed by a movie for a very long time. Again, sad to see such a waste of resources. One can tell the writers have no depth whatsoever. No real suffering to get inspired by. Not enough creativity and pathos to explore this storyline.","

Not in a good way where you want to ponder on the predicament that is human nature , but instead in a way that makes you want to fast forward the movie . Overall that is my take - I hated the story and I hated the characters and I was , frankly , shocked. Which for me is honestly very rare .This gets a 4 instead of a 1 for a few reasons . I love a good mixed genre . I love knowing very little about a movie , having it start one way and making some assumptions to only be confused 30 min later, and then surprise it's something else entirely . I respect that in a film and this killed it in that are .The second thing which was very positive was I felt the character development ( at least in a satirical way ) was fantastic - well developed , good acting and writing to get you to view each character in a very specific way to set the climax up correctly .Lastly - it did keep you drawn in .It was overly artistic , completely pretentious and pretty nasty .

",Howling_at_the_Moon_Reviews,08-Jan-24,"Ok, so I'm not sure if I fully understand all the hype around this movie. It was definitely entertaining but I don't think that I thought it was quite as phenomenal as everyone else.It was far too long and I think that negatively effected the pacing and that might've been my biggest issue. I found my mind wandering and even slightly bored at times. I wish they had fully dove into the thriller genre and amped up the intensity a bit. I think if we had the exact same storyline just a little bit more concise it would've been far more successful in my eyes. The long runtime and an almost superfluous nature that can come along with it comes across a bit indulgent and self righteous at times. I think some of the more shocking scenes such as the bathtub and the grave, I liked them as standalone scenes but within the big picture of the production and story as a whole I don't know that they added much other than exactly that... shock value.Despite this, it was a solidly fun and entertaining story, evoking a wide range of emotions throughout. The acting was pretty stellar here and everyone did quite the good job. Aesthetically it was also pretty superior, with a lot of cool imagery and beautiful shots.

The extremely beautiful camerawork, and the sometimes abrupt plot twists which seem to have no real psychological explanation, give this film an air of a poem - a strange poem that does not give a realistic picture of the ""real"" world but follows its own inner logic.

Saltburn," The film has had a successful limited release in the US and expanded nationwide.
",GusherPop,27-Dec-23,"Saltburn, a sophomore feature by Emerald Fennell, has been a subject of debate among critics and viewers. Some view the film as flashy and self-satisfied, while others see it as a successful erotic thriller with titillating shocks. The film has had a successful limited release in the US and expanded nationwide. However, some critics argue that the film's visuals, such as a character slurping another's bathwater and a cocky ending, may be a sign of perverse genius or cheap tricks masquerading as it. The film has gained popularity on TikTok, with many expressing a rift between its staff and the film's overall aesthetic. The Saltburn divide is not a satire film but rather its artifices, including visual provocations, luxe tableaus, and bold telegraphing of desire. Vibes are a powerful tool in cinema, allowing audiences to process entertainment that is predominantly based on them. They can be a portal to the intangible particulars of another time, place, or era, as seen in Sofia Coppola's impressionistic Priscilla. Many festival circuit films this year, such as Raven Jackson's All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt, Jonathan Glazer's Zone of Interest, Annie Baker's Janet Planet, and Steve McQueen's Occupied City, use feelings, mood, visual language, and sensory experience to communicate the unspoken human experience. These films argue against the tyranny of story in how we evaluate screen-based media, allowing audiences to experience the unspoken human experience through their cinematic experiences. Saltburn is a film by Fennell that showcases the eccentricities of its characters, but it lacks a cohesive plot. The film's main problem is that most of its plotting is saved for the final stretch, with Fennell being vague about everyone's motivations and actions. This results in the film drifting along and suddenly hurries through several major revelations with the speed of someone who wants to reach the end of an anecdote before their phone battery runs out. Some of these revelations are more ingenious than others, but Fennell is prone to fumble them and has little to say about class divisions that hasn't been said more pithily in several recent films. Saltburn may seem half-hearted and lacks the focused anger of Promising Young Woman. However, if seen as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, it is deliriously enjoyable. The dialogue and performances are what clinch it, with Oliver being awestruck by the priceless Old Masters on the house's oak-panelled walls and Pike, Grant, and Mulligan competing to be the most obnoxious. Keoghan delivers an impressively committed performance in a movie that considers itself shocking, with ""Saltburn's"" final scene being the most true representation. The film's beauty and emptyness are evident, but Fennell's set-up leaves viewers wanting more. The final scene is a bravura tracking shot.","

It's worth it, but I wish it had been a little more subtle and not contain the same, infamous exposition to explain everything like in Psycho.

Saltburn," A Wicked Sense of Humor Doesn't Quite Offset a Superficial Thriller
",EUyeshima,27-Dec-23,"Director/screenwriter Emerald Fennell appears to relish pushing all our buttons when she targets class envy and relentless obsession in this dark 2023 hybrid of black comedy and psychological thriller. Same as her directorial debut, ""Promising Young Woman"", the story centers on a fractured personality, this time a shy but resourceful Oxford scholarship student named Oliver, who latches on to Felix, a handsome party boy who comes from a filthy rich aristocratic family, the members of which lead vacuous, insulated lives. Plotwise, it's pretty obvious where the story is going, especially if you've seen ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", but Fennell displays a wicked and often cavalier sense of humor in sorting out the fates of her ethically challenged characters. The film's more pressing problem though is how superficial the plot remains with only a minimum of emotional investment allocated. Regardless, the cast is game with Barry Keoghan properly elliptical as Oliver and Jacob Elordi effortlessly charismatic as Felix. However, as Felix's clueless parents, Richard E. Grant and especially Rosamund Pike steal the film with their shrewdly observed turns. Carey Mulligan shows up briefly as a forlorn Bohemian party guest. There are nice satirical jabs and genuinely uncomfortable moments, but the film just refuses to go deep.","

Saltburn," I enjoyed it. Why? you ask. I just did.
",levybob,10-Jan-24,"I enjoyed Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn'. I can't say why exactly but I stayed with it up to its utterly bizarre final scene. Though now that I've said that, the final scene was actually very much in keeping with the rest of the film: strange. Very.I had the feeling I'd seen a film like Saltburn before. A tale of a stranger entering a household, 'seducing' each member of the family, and gradually taking the family over. In fact, I did. It was Terrance Stamp in Passolini's 'Teorema' who serves the role of the seductive outsider who wins over a bourgeois family. In 'Six Degrees of Separation' it is Will Smith in a similar setting. And there were others. Babysitter films whose names escape me.But here it is Barry Keoghan's Oliver Quick who, as a seemingly quiet, friendless, ordinary young man at Oxford, comes to spend his summer at the castle of a new wealthy friend (Felix, played by Jacob Elordi). Once we arrive at the castle the action picks up, with each family member (Rosamund Pike as the mother, Richard E. Grant as father, and various others) falling under Oliver Quick's spell.Now none of these characters is the least bit likable. And we are never absolutely sure of whether Oliver Quick is weaving his web intentionally or not. And, if he is, is the family's lack of warmth or caring worthy of our sympathies? These issues may well cause the viewer to give up, to leave before the film's attempt at resolution. But I stayed with it. I stayed with it in spite of my feelings of distance from the film's storyline.I was, I guess, curious to find out. Simple as that. How will this turn out?And find out, I did.At least I think so.","

",mrsatan79,31-Jan-24,"Saltburnis a visually stunning piece, showcasing meticulous attention to aesthetics. The narrative, while intriguing, follows a familiar path akin to ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" However, the film takes an unexpected turn with controversial and disturbing scenes that appear disconnected from the plot, seemingly inserted for shock value. These moments feel forced, leaving one to question their necessity and correlation with the overarching story.Despite the film's undeniable visual appeal and a compelling narrative, the inclusion of these shocking scenes raises concerns about their intent. It appears more a ploy for attention than a genuine exploration of societal norms, potentially alienating younger or conservative audiences.The end of the movie looks also disconneted from the rest and leae us with several question marks. In essence, while Saltburn has its merits, the discordant elements prevent it from fully justifying the hype.","

Saltburn," Interesting...Intriguing...and dark
",bankofmarquis,29-Dec-23,"Actress/Writer/Director Emerald Fennell is turning into an artistic voice that bears noticing and with SALTBURN - her follow-up to PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (the film that won her the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) - Fennell's artistic voice is in full bloom.Starring Barry Keoghan (Oscar nominated for THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN), SALTBURN tells the story of an Oxford student who befriends the rich, cool kid (Jacob Elordi, EUPHORIA) who invites him back to his family compound, SALTBURN, for the summer with his eccentric (to say the least) family.As written and directed by Fennell, SALTBURN is a satire on the elite rich, showing them in their extravagant, quirky isolation in their compound, looking down on the common folk from their piles of money (or...in some cases...oblivious of the common folk because of their money) while peeling back the layers to show the unhappiness and manipulation underneath.Fennell layers this story richly, slowly folding back facades and layers to show the ugliness of inherently unhappy people who cover their unhappiness up with wealth, money and parties.Into this world comes Oliver Quick (Keoghan) who is the audiences' conduit into this level of living - and who has secrets of his own.Keoghan is interesting to watch (as always) and the family...Elordi, Sadie Soverall (his sister) and Archie Madekwe (another outsider who is jealous of Oliver's appearance) all are good looking, good enough performers who live the hedonistic lifestyle and deny the consequences and responsibilities thereof.When a film needs an ""ice queen"" as the matriarch of a family, Rosamund Pike is, inevitably, brought in and she brings the goods to Saltburn. She is perfectly cast as the mother of the family who says what she thinks, does not show what she is feeling and doesn't give a darn about anyone else. She is suitably balanced by the off-balanced, quirky performance of the always good Richard E. Grant as the patriarch of the family who is (usually) lost in his own little world of whatever fantasy he is currently involved in.But if this was just a film about a quirky family, it would be a fun, interesting romp. But...in Fennell's hands, it becomes something much more sinister - and much more interesting - to watch.Saltburn is a film that one must sit with after watching to digest what was just witnessed, but...ultimately...is one that is very interesting....and intriguing...and dark.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","

Saltburn," Superfluous, cliché and a nice castle.
",pablokurt,25-Dec-23,"Don´t waste your time. It´s a cliché movie with a actor that can´t deliver what the movie wants, because it´s all over the place. It´s stupid, not believable at all. It pretends to be dark an perverse but it feels forced and struggles with coping with all the things the movie tries to deliver. The 4:3 aspect ratio tries to give the impression of a serious movie but it´s far from that. The acting is bad, over the top sometimes and not believable. The main actor is good but he can´t keep up being the leading actor. Anyway, I´ll stop here. Not a good movie. If you want to see something in a castle, perversion, plots against each other watch ""the favorite"" instead.","

",GregTheStopSign95,01-Jan-24,"Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I didn't find anything about this movie to be thrilling (as in thriller movies kind of thrilling, it was certainly thrilling to watch in the sense that I got a lot of enjoyment from it) OR disturbing. Maybe I'm just broken, though?Anyway, Saltburn really is a VERY good movie, and deserving of most (if not all) of the praise it's getting. It's obviously informed by many other movies and books and so on, but it's also very much its own animal as well, and it does everything so well.Jacob Elordi is great as Felix, and Alison Oliver is similarly great as Felix's sister Venetia, Archie Madekwe is great as their cousin Farleigh, even Paul Rhys in his 'small' role of the family butler Duncan is REALLY good in his moments - especially the closing of the curtains. Richard E Grant is typically wonderful as the patriarch of the Catton family, Sir James, and Rosamund Pike is also in top form as Lady Elspeth, but the REAL star is, of course, Barry Keoghan. He is INCREDIBLE here...Then there's that ending. That perfect, PERFECT ending. I could not possibly imagine it ending any better than it did, in all its glory. It's near guaranteed to have Sophie Ellis Bextor's ""Murder On The Dance Floor"" stuck in your head, whether you dance around the house to it or not.","

Saltburn," Great atmosphere but a few plot problems
",o_s_k_r,24-Jan-24,"I loved the atmosphere of saltburn and I thought the behaviour of the toffs was both funny and authentic. Also the way the story gradually tipped into a psychotic place was quite satisfying.However there are some problems with the last third of the movie. It doesn't feel remotely credible that Ollie should get away so easily with the murder of Felix. He's never shown collecting any kind of poison. What is it? Fentanyl? Ricin? What kills Felix so instantly? We're told that a coroner is on site but apparently they don't care about cause of death. Nobody investigated the bottle for poison? What about the girl who SAW OLLIE WITH FELIX moments before his death? If a beloved member of your family died mysteriously you probably would investigate, but apparently not in this case.Similar problem with the death of Vee. She doesn't seem particularly close to killing herself so it's hard to believe that Ollie simply drove her there with some evil words. And if in fact it was him who killed her then there would have been some evidence. Footprints etc outside the bathtub.In a nutshell: these two murders are not explained well and it's ludicrous that any parents would shrug off the mysterious death of both their children. There's also characters like Duncan and Farley who are rightfully suspicious of Ollie, but disappear from the story. Why did they give up so easily? Surely they have a stake in this?","

Saltburn," It has it's ups and downs
",Boristhemoggy,06-Jan-24,"I almost gave up on Saltburn, despite Keoghan and Pike's fabulous performances. Elordi stood out too but the stars of the show were Keoghan and Pike.I'm unsure why Carey Mulligan gets rave review for this film. I do like her but she's in for about 5 minutes and her part and her acting in that part aren't all that great. Richard E Grant far surpasses Mulligan as does the unknown to me Alison Oliver as Venetia.The dialogue is often monotonous and meaningless and uncomfortable. Moreso than just natural awkwardness in people. And while the set is fabulous the music drove me almost to insanity as it was far too loud. Directors like to think they are music curators but what they do is simply spoil the movement of the story and annoy people. The only stand out music was at the end with Sophie Ellis Bextor's fabulous Murder on the Dance Floor. Keoghan slayed this part too.The ending by the time it got there was not a massive surprise, and not carried out with panache. I felt that throughout the film, the director Fennell wasn't quite sure what she wanted to achieve and how to achieve anything. I certainly don't think there was much comedy either. I read one review that said there was lots of belly laughs: I truly don't know what film they were watching but it wasn't Saltburn that's for sure.Overall, if you're patient and get carried away by some great performances, you'll probably like the film. Pike is so underrated it's insane but her and Grant gave it the lift Keoghan needed to make a strong cast.","

Saltburn," Saltburn: A Trending Tale of Twists and Turns
",drhemp,25-Dec-23,"I recently watched Saltburn, which was listed as Amazon's number 2 trending film in the UK on Christmas Eve. Although I knew very little about the movie, I assumed a movie trending well at the start of the holiday season would likely be a good film. I'm pleased to say it didn't disappoint.The film starts at Oxford University, where a seemingly shy yet intelligent working-class boy from Liverpool befriends charming aristocrat Felix, who is on the same course and then invites him to spend the summer with his eccentric and incredibly wealthy family's gigantic estate.As the summer goes on, tensions rise within the household as Oliver finds himself in the middle of it all and secrets are revealed. However, as the film progresses, it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems with Felix or Oliver.The performances from the entire cast were exceptional, but I want to give a special mention to Barry Keoghan, who played the leading role of Olive Quick. Also, Richard E. Grant was his usual brilliant self as Sir James Catton, the Lord of the Manor, although he is not a Lord.I read that the film was advertised as an LGBTQ movie. However, in my opinion, it's not strictly a gay film or a romantic comedy. While some characters are presumed to be gay or bisexual, there are many references to sex and romance, both for gay and straight characters. It certainly has some homoerotic moments and scenes that gay men may enjoy, including a very naked Barry Keoghan, but it's not an LGBT movie. However, it does have some undertones of that genre. It's a black comedy that, unlike so many films that try to be provocative and funny, actually succeeds in its attempt.This is an excellent film, and I can't say too much about it without giving spoilers. There are a lot of surprises in this movie, and I'm already looking forward to watching it again.","

",Pairic,20-Nov-23,"Saltburn: A black comedy/psychological thriller which slides into the slipstream of horror. 2006, Barry Keoghan plays Oliver Quick, a working class lad from a grim background who makes it to Oxford University on a scholarship. He ifeels unable to fit in with the In Crowd but one day does a favour for the popular, aristocratic Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). This gets him (literally) a seat at the table with the society he longs to join. When Oliver's father dies, Felix invites him to his stately home, Saltburn for the Summer. The Catton family are ghastly, Felix hears them gossiping about his family, when he is presented to them they feign love and interest. Everything is so shallow about them though the father. Richard E. Grant is quite manic in his role, constantly grinning. Felix's mother (Rosamund Pike) also pretends to care about people but only for appearances sake. His sister Venetia (Alison Oliver) suffers from bulimia but appears to interest Oliver. Things morph from a comedy of manners to a dark horror comedy as Oliver shows hidden depths. Some really disturbing scenes which are leavened by the blackest of black comedy. A Dickensian tale mixed with Brideshead Revisited, a dash of Ripping Yarns with a soupcon of The Talented Mr Ripley. A film you will mull over long after the final credits have rolled. Written, Directed and Produced by Emerald Fennell. 8.5/10.","

Saltburn," Slowburn: Murder on the Dancefloor
",pete-murphy97,03-Dec-23,"Saltburn is a crazed caricature. Absurdist to the nth degree. It's punctuated with the allure of witty, pithy dialogue and outrageous characters, but the plot doesn't pull its weight through to any real finality. The shock-value is cranked up to the maximum, an overplayed hand; with only anticlimax to show for it. The payoff only lands softly as the film slowly meanders to Sophie Ellis-Bextor's iconic early 2000s ""Murder on the Dancefloor"" backed credits. Saltburn is a publicity stunt, it desperately wants to rile and provoke, to be talked about by urgently grabbing the viewer's attention by means of shock-value, and secondly allowing the director's more subtle commentary on class to be discovered after the fact. In its open-endedness, it struggles to justify the point of its own existence in the midst of its attention-seeking rhetoric. It tries so hard to be idiosyncratic that it at times becomes somewhat overexposed, and errs to state the obvious.The film's director, Emerald Fennell, hails from the same upper classes she targets. We are offered her insider's take; her ace in the hole that populates the script with hilariously classist opines, jabs, and devilish quips. Fennell satirically imagines both halves of society; one half envious, clamouring, coveting, pining, self-conscious, and scheming, the other half decadent, proud, sneering, prideful, and detached. But nothing said here hasn't been said elsewhere in the ""eat-the-rich"" discussion. Nonetheless, the issue is less the originality of what is said overall, but instead *how* things are said. I would say this could be the most intricate exploration and representation of class behaviour, at least in British culture, ever put to the cinema screen. This is a story of the haves and the moth-like want-mores. Even despite it being quite clearly derivative from the likes of Mr. Ripley.Saltburn's cast is a strong point, with standout performances from Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike, and Richard E. Grant. But Keoghan's character is ultimately a maniac without a cause. However, seen as a black comedy caricature through the lense of Marxian class theory, Saltburn's value can be truly felt.7.4/10.","

",samnaji-15383,17-Jan-24,"Get a bowl and throw in the ingredients from The Talented Mr Ripley, The Great Gatsby, and Brideshead Revisited. Stir. Bake. What you get is Saltburn.By itself that is not a bad thing. Overall, I really enjoyed the film as it had elements of mystery and second guessing throughout. Emerald Fennell does an excellent job in keeping the viewer uncomfortable and sympathetic at the same time for the character Oliver who is magnificently played by Barry Keoghan. Some sleuths out there will have jumped the gun and rushed to the conclusion by the time the second act starts, but that is not to take away the great play of words and set pieces.The 4:3 aspect ratio is an excellent decision because it is used perfectly for framing faces and given most of this film we are staring at either Oliver or Felix (Jacob Elordi), the aspect ratio focuses our gaze on their nuanced performances. The film is all about characters (and an amazing mansion) so widescreen is not necessary. I guess I like the 4:3 aspect in some films now. I also found the cinematography to be very good with great use of lighting and shadow.I would have awarded the film a higher rating if it was not for the fact the relationship between Oliver and Elspeth (Rosamund Pike) was not fleshed out more in the third act. If anything, the film could have benefited from an additional ten minutes to establish why Elspeth so much needed the company of Oliver when all we had to go with was that she was emotionally cold (or has the facade of one). I did enjoy the payoff but felt it was all a little rushed towards the end. It required the viewer to make a lot of assumptions and to fill in the gaps.","

Saltburn," Too much hype
",ccamn,29-Dec-23,"Spent most of the movie waiting for something to happen while watching boring rich university students do boring things. When it finally did happen i was left shocked that that was it.""Meh"" is the only way to describe this movie. I wanted it to be good which was probably where I went wrong. With all the great reviews and the social media reaction videos, I expected a gripping and somewhat disturbing movie. Only a couple short scenes could be classified as such but due to the rest of the scenes being so uneventful it really dimmed any ""shocking"" scenes.The only positive comment that can make is that the acting, music and settings were well done.","

",andypike-22859,24-Dec-23,"Firstly, ignore the reviews on here about it being shocking. Yes there are a few scenes where you go 'urghhh' but nothing compared to some other films you may have watched.This is an excellent, different, visually stunning film, with brilliant acting, screenplay and dark comedy.It turns the whole rich vs poor story on its head, and always surprises you along the way.The house featured is a character all of its own too. Absolutely gorgeous backdrops to the story.In a world of boring, seen-it-all-before superhero and action films, we need more films like this that are interesting, different and surprising.","

Saltburn," Two hours of my life I won't get back
",vselden,05-Jan-24,"Inconsistent characterisations - most particularly the main character who was badly underexplored and mis-cast, no proper plot development, lots of stereotypes and no character to empathise with which is really hard to pull off in a film and this one fails on all counts. Incoherent, no dramatic tension and an ending you could see coming a mile off. A writer who believes that welding together a collection of stuff she has seen and liked in other films will do the trick, but you have to wonder what she was trying to say to her audience. Nothing of interest or note as far as I could make out. The sort of film that people might think they like because they can't really figure out what's wrong with it. Perhaps dazzled by style over content. The cinematography was good, but I think when you start to notice that, then it's because the narrative has lost you. A shame because I was looking forward to it, and it was a total and forgettable disappointment.","

Saltburn," Utter Garbage
",Shakiritis,30-Dec-23,"Nonsense of a film. Half-cooked characters on a weak plot make it terribly tough to watch. Honestly, nothing really happens over the 120 minutes. The talent of the cast combined is immense but the plot is so damn horrible that they never got to get into their groove. I don't really understand the positove reviews! It's apparent that the director tried to bring a dark vibe into the film. Which never really happened. It was supposed to be a psychological thriller. Eventually, it turned out quite the opposite. There is no thrill at all. You would be able to predict the ending even half way into the film (maybe way before that.Highly recommended though, if you are having trouble sleeping.","

Saltburn," Emerald Fennell creates an engaging and uncomfortable psychological satirical thriller with gothic undertones and shades of Patricia Highsmith
",IonicBreezeMachine,23-Dec-23,"Set in the early 2000s, Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is a working-class student on scholarship to Oxford where he often finds himself isolated due to the cultural divide between him and the other attending students. After befriending wealthy student Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi), Oliver is invited to spend the Summer at Felix's family estate Saltburn where he meets the eccentric Catton family consisting of Sir James (Richard E. Grant) and Lady Elspeth (Rosmund Pike), Felix's siter Venetia (Alison Oliver), and their cousin Farleigh (Archie Madekwe) who makes no secret of his disdain for Oliver. Over the course of the Summer, Oliver ingrains himself into the lifestyle of the Cattons until darker revelations reveal themselves and send ripples throughout the Catton family and estate.Saltburn is this sophomore feature of Emerald Fennell who previously made a name for herself with 2020's Promising Young Woman. Taking inspiration from country house set stories, Fennell creates some characters who are despicable but also oddly compelling in a story that takes its time in setup before building to a strong and memorable finish.In terms of acting, Saltburn is a fantastic showcase for an ensemble cast with not only the Catton family made up of status conscious snobs whose atrocious attitudes are either worn on their sleeves or hidden behind a transparent veil of empty sympathy. All of the characters have some flaw be it in a tenuous grasp on status as is the case with Farleigh, a hunger for validation in the case of Venetia, or in Felix's tendency to pick-up lower class ""strays"". Barry Keoghan is absolutely fantastic in the role of Oliver Quick and what starts out as a seemingly innocuous observer into this world of opulence and wealth is soon revealed to be a rich multi-layered portrayal that becomes increasingly absorbing minute by minute as Keoghan has to act out certain grotesque or off-putting scenes that would be a challenge for most actors.In terms of the writing, Saltburn initially seems like it's trying to position itself as an ""eat the rich"" type story in the vein of The Menu or Glass Onion, but while that element is there I'd say the movie has more in common with the works of Patricia Highsmith in how it becomes a psychological game of wits as filtered through this satirical drama in a countryside house. I can't give too much away but the movie builds an uneasy voyeuristic atmosphere that culminates in a devious and wicked ending. The movie won't be for everyone as there are sequences that are difficult to watch due to how uncomfortable they are (even if they are well acted), and scenes involving a bathtub or late night rendezvous in the garden will definitely not be for the squeamish.While Saltburn took its time in setting up its story, I was ultimately satisfied with the route it took and the payoff it built up to. The movie features excellent acting across the board especially from its lead Barry Keoghan who creates one of the most memorably off-putting protagonists I've seen in some time.","

Saltburn," An emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another
",YellowManReanimated,02-Jan-24,"SaltburnIf one were looking for a definition of tastelessness in cinematic form then I would suggest this effort as a worthy candidate. One should note that it's not particularly worthy in many other respects, with the notable exception of its cinematography and set design; these happen to be the only areas where any true care appears to have been given. For example, there are some arresting uses of shadow, and a variety of visually stimulating locations but there endeth the praise, almost...I also wish to make some positive remarks regarding the performance of Rosamund Pike, who, to my mind, is an extraordinary actress who hasn't received the filmic exposure that her talents merit. Her icy charisma and ability to appear authentic in pretty much any role she undertakes makes her scenes one of the very few pleasures this movie bestows.Now onto the problems. Firstly, there are the characters. The fact that none of them, except possibly Pike's, appears credible is not actually the film's biggest issue; what is much more dissatisfying is that none of the relationships in the film are even marginally convincing. There is not an iota of chemistry between any of the film's characters and that especially applies to the relationship which occupies the film's central focus, that between Oliver (Barry Keoghan) and Felix (Jacob Elordi). Now it's easy for one to excuse this by referring to how emotionally dysfunctional Oliver and Felix (as well as the entirety of Felix's family) appear to be, but that would be to miss the point. There isn't even any superficial connection or slight moment of feeling that is generated between Oliver and Felix which would make you believe that they would bother to utter a morning greeting to each other, never mind about the idea that one would invite the other to his family home. The issue here is not with the acting but with the pacing, the writing and, most significantly, the film's incessantly odious tone.The general misanthropy and nastiness that pervades each scene does not provide any space for the actors to begin to cultivate any sense of fine feeling, or feeling of any kind in fact, for each other. Oliver talks about loving and being in love at the beginning of the film but all we are truly presented with is an emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another. There is no emotional texture to draw on, there's no empathy, no joy, no connection, and, thus, there are no stakes. It is simply impossible to care what becomes of any of the characters because the film never allowed any of the characters to become anything in the first place.Some of this would've been redeemed if the film was at least humorous. However, I'm afraid that, despite a number of obvious and jarring attempts, humour was never experienced for this viewer. The film was in fact painfully humourless. After all, it's hard to laugh at scenarios which are neither persuasive nor engaging.A word should be spoken on the casting of Barry Keoghan as the film's protagonist. Yes, he was probably miscast. His Liverpudlian accent is inconsistent and while he does creepy and arresting extremely well in other films, he possesses none of the oily charm or comfortingly sympathetic demeanour his character requires. Matt Damon does a much better job in a film with similar themes: The Talented Mr Ripley. He demonstrates a boyish innocence and exuberance alongside an unnatural cunning which makes him endearing and credible and thus draws him into a world to which someone of his station would normally be barred entry. Keoghan's Oliver, on the other hand, one would not wish to touch with a barge pole, and, if one did, one would run away from him as soon as one had found oneself doing so. However, the casting of Keoghan only serves to speak to larger faults with the film. He was unsuitable, it's true, but so was the entire movie.So, what seemed as if it might have been a worthwhile, visceral investigation of the way class and privilege operate in 21st century Britain ends up being an ugly, uninteresting, vicious mess. Its plot begins as muddy and ends as being ridiculous to the point of insult, so insulting, in fact, that I shan't bother to offer any further comment on it. Its sense of place is much weaker than it ought to be, bearing in mind that the film's title is eponymous with it, and its sense of time is utterly arbitrary (was it set around 2006 just so the director got to include her favourite tunes? I can't think of any other reason). Thus, the overall effect of the film is to inspire very little outside of boredom and jaded disgust.4/10 (3 points for Rosamund and 1 for the pretty colours and sets)","

Saltburn," Masturbatory
",HypnoticPoison7,29-Dec-23,"Aesthetically, this movie is glorious. It's bright and poppy use of color in between dreary English scenery is a welcome departure from the uncomfortable and awkward exchanges between most all of the characters. Sadly there were only the occasional witty lines, not as many or as memorable as Promising Young Woman. Perhaps they shouldn't be compared, but this one feels more like a first time directors film, while the other feels like a magnum opus. Compared to that, this was a far less believable story. The characters seem genuine on the surface, but are far too intense for their age. I know everyone is comparing it to the talented Mr Ripley, and it's an accurate comparison. Except that the latter is meant to be a creepy thriller, and this movie doesn't seem to know what it is. It's deceptive. One thing the talented Mr Ripley had going for it was it never crossed the line into being disgusting for the sake of it, making it very rewatchable. This movie is the kind of movie you're glad to only see once.If you don't mind the grotesque and the vapid, you won't regret watching this. I'll still see anything Emerald writes and directs because she knows how to draw your attention and she definitely has a voice, even if it isn't exactly clear what she's saying.","

",chadbrockmd,27-Oct-23,"A movie where the audience screams "" No! No! Ewwww!"" is clearly getting a reaction. Saltburn is sexy, funny and a shocking at times. It pulls you in with beautiful people and even more beautiful scenery and then starts to reveal that it is a much different movie than you expected. If you have a problen with depictions of body fluids this might not be your film. If you can stomach it then you're in for some sticky fun.It also is a nice slice of milenium nostalgia with a great sound track The last scene of the movie has a perfect song choice and leaves you feeling a bit confused as you're still processing what you've seen while you want to dance out of the theater.","

",DragonTwoSeven,23-Dec-23,"Many films leave you saying, ""If only they had taken it further,"" and this is certainly not one of them. One cannot help but notice the gothic bloody homage to Bram Stoker's Dracula (you will know the scene I am referring to). And that castle dance of a finale is the icing on the cake to this unique and boundary-crushing movie.Every single performance from the characters is mesmerizing, even when there is a slow and subtle buildup.Emerald Fennell is quickly becoming a favorite director: unafraid to take risks, a flair for beauty, and the willingness to take you places you've never been before cinematically.","

Saltburn," What A Film! I am totally love it love it
",AdrianSince19xx,23-Dec-23,"This film ia way so good. Emerald Fennell's class-obsessed film is a deliciously twisty tale of grotesque overprivilege. Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi lead a gung-ho cast, which includes Carey Mulligan and Richard E Grant, who is having the time of his life. What ensues is a heady midsummer's nightmare at Felix's family home in the eponymous estate: a gargantuan manor where secrets line the many, many walls and every beautiful thing hides horrible truths and even more lies. It would be easy to dismiss it as an all-too familiar affair for Fennell, who graduated Oxford in 2007 and rarely shies away from her affluent upbringing - but Saltburn is so delicious in its twists, the gorgeously lensed disasters and endless farces, that it's impossible to ignore the work of a truly gifted and haywire filmmaker.","

Saltburn," Crazy, sexy, cool (and that's just Jacob Elordi)
",matt-27634,25-Dec-23,"Barry Keoghan plays Oliver, a quiet introvert on a scholarship at Oxford University, who becomes enamoured by the cool and popular guy on campus Felix (played by Jacob Elordi). A chance encounter allows the two to meet and become friends, and when a family tragedy strikes Oliver, he is invited by Felix to stay at his family's manor 'Saltburn' over the summer break. There we are introduced to Felix's' eccentric but equally alluring family. Oliver is intimidated by each of them, but desperately wants to fit in too, and over the course of the film, his character and values change as the debauchery increases. The film includes plenty of sex, drugs, death and twists to keep the audience both entertained and intrigued throughout, but there is also a high level of shock value that may put people off as well.I'd briefly seen the trailer when it was first released, but had soon forgotten about it, and since the film's official release, all I've heard is how wild and unexpected it is. Of course I had to give it a go to see what all the fuss was about. I must say, i agree with all the comments, but aside from how wild it is, its actually an amazing film, full of complex characters.Rosamund Pike is a great actor, and she's chosen some pretty iconic roles in her career. Her portrayal of Felix's mother Elspeth continues that trend, and the character was worthy of her own film. Elspeth reminded me so much of Belinda Bromilow's Aunt Elizabeth from 'The Great' and her accent was positively delightful. She delivered some scene stealing one liners, and I really hope she garners more than a few awards for the role.Jacob Elordi is proving to be a versatile actor, and although his English accent wasn't a complete fail, it sounded obviously put on. He also looked 5 meters tall next to the vertically challenged Barry Keoghan. Felix was the epitome of a golden boy, who had everything. Girls want to date him, guys wanted to be him (and let's face it, date him too) and he was effortlessly charming.At first, Barry Keoghan looked too old to be playing a college student, and although in real life he is 31, if I were told he was 51, I'd believe it. I was impressed by his acting, and he played the shy and eager-to-please character so well. I really connected with Oliver when he first arrived at Saltburn, as it reminded me of being invited on holidays with a friend's family and wanting to be accepted by them. When Oliver's character suddenly changes half way through the film, it was unexpected and a little unnerving. There were some subtle hints at a werewolf or a Jekyll and Hide story that didn't eventuate, but the film could have easily taken either direction. Oliver was such an interesting character who evoked empathy from the audience for most of the film. It was a real ballsy (pun intended) performance from Keoghan, one that he will be remembered for throughout his career.Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia gets an honourable mention, as she was one of the more complex characters who was given some tough material to work with.One of the many highlights for me was the film's cinematography. It's choices of colour, lighting and setting showed romance, grandeur and so much emotion. There were several shots that would make amazing pieces of art as stills, and I enjoyed the symbolism throughout such as the frequent use of mirror images and reflections. The costuming was also great, especially those worn by the women. There was an awesome soundtrack too from the early 2000's, and the use of Sophie Ellis-Bexter's hit 'Murder on the Dancefloor' in the final scene was the icing on the cake.The only negatives I had with this film were some of the more controversial and graphic scenes (the details of which I will not spoil), which I understand added to the tone of the film, but to me, were a bit too gross and confronting. The other negative I had was how they used (or didn't) the brilliant Carey Mulligan. Her character of Poor Dear Pamela looked to be just as iconic as Elspeth in her first scene, however it was her only scene, and she was quickly written out of the rest of the film. I understand cameos, but don't give such a celebrated actor a great role, only for it to be 20 seconds of screen time or less.Saltburn stands as a testament to the artistry of modern cinema, radiating an aura of darkness and mystery, with a narrative that is as seductive as it is intriguing and shocking. It embraces its provocative nature but gives its characters purpose as well as beauty that shines through.","

Saltburn," Largely boring, with some disgusting moments, and then a killer twist... better on second viewing?
",Groverdox,08-Jan-24,"Here's a strange one. I guess it's fairly unique. It's one of those movies that only really grabs you right at the end, when it pulls its twist out, and maybe makes you want to go back and re-watch.I don't know if I will though. Probably the only parts of this movie I'll remember, if any, will be memorable for how disgusting they were. In one scene, Barry Keoghan slurps at semen-laced bathwater after Jacob Elordi has burped the worm in the tub, and in another scene, we see Keoghan's lips red with blood after he goes down on a menstruating woman. Both pretty gross.There's no denying that Keoghan has something. His character here reminded me of the one he played in ""Killing of a Sacred Deer"". Remote and unsettling. His small, blue eyes seem to see everything, but his homely face gives nothing away.I kept thinking that Keoghan is like one of those old-style movie stars like James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart. Despite his unconventional looks and short stature he just has something that makes you want to watch him.Elordi, on the other hand, I'm still not sure of. He reminds me of Armie Hammer. Tall, too Hollywood handsome. Boring. Without a style of his own. Playing against Keoghan, they're like polar opposites. Elordi looks like a model whose face you'd see on the wall of a hair salon. You forget what he looks like. Keoghan, though? There's a face you can't forget, which, again, is just like Cagney, Bogart, Robinson.As I say, I might re-watch this movie to see if I like it any better the second time. Not sure if I will though. The twist was impressive, but it was a pretty hard slog to get to it.","

Then the following scene, Alison Carver(Venetia) was amazing!! She did a fabulous job. Truthfully one of the reasons I didn't like this more was Barry Keoghan(Oliver) for me he just wasn't charming enough for his role. I don't know, just something never clicked with me. He just couldn't pull off the savviness his character should've had. Then we have the finale, the last few minutes actually changed how I felt. Great ending, they left nothing to the imagination.

",awuk-885-568987,11-Jan-24,"Others have taken time to write detailed critical reviews.....I thus see little value in me typing an essay.At the time of typing, (Jan 2024) most chat I have seen or heard re the movie has been about controversial scenes rather than plot,, characters or storyline.Not a masterpiece psychological thriller/drama....for me.For those wanting stimulation or to be shocked I suggest using a suitable streaming service or watching some true life crime documentaries.Crucially I was not fussed about any of the characters or what happened to them.I kept pausing to see how long was left.The final twist revelations cynically vague.Sorry fans.","

Saltburn," It's been days since viewing, and I'm still wondering ""Why?""
",kdkeesh,29-Jan-24,"This movie was visually stunning. It was otherwise a weird watch. I quite liked that it was odd-a bit of a ""WTF??"" palate cleanser. It's been about a week since I watched it, and I'm still having random thoughts where I'm questioning why Oli did what he did. Even though we get to see at the end that he'd meticulously planned the whole charade, it still doesn't answer the ""why?"". Was murder the plan all along, or was he driven to it once Felix discovered the lies about Oli's family?I may be in the minority of people that didn't catch on to Oliver's lies in the beginning. It wasn't until I saw the switcheroo at the castle that I had my ""oh sh**!"" realization.The period scene was weird. The grave scene even more weird. The ending dance scene (which made me chuckle) was another bit of weird. None of those things made the film hard for me to watch, and I enjoyed the acting throughout. I just wish I wasn't left with so many questions.","

Saltburn," Eat the rich? Hell yeah!
",jonathon-champion,13-Jan-24,"Ok so I admit it was all the hype about Murder on the Dancefloor revival splashed all over instagram which spurred me to watch this film which takes you down the rabbit hole all the way. No spoilers here what I suggest is skip the reviews and watch this with an open mind. All the star actors give a strong performance's particularly Oliver whose character is indeed malevolent at best, macabre and diabolical at worst. Honestly one of the most refreshing movies I've seen in a while and something which epitomizes the 2000s at its surreal money on a wheel best. So give it a go and hang on to the crescendo at the end with Sophie Ellis Bextor, it's more that worth the killer wait!","

Saltburn," I wasn't expecting that...
",pedroquintaoo,31-Dec-23,"Emerald Fennell reaffirms her brilliance as a director, taking a simple premise and crafting a film that is truly atmospheric, filled with suspense, tension, and irreverent satirical humor. The impeccable cast, featuring Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike, and Jacob Elordi, steals the spotlight with their unique and peculiar portrayals.The intelligently developed plot avoids a straightforward narrative, delving into a story rich in symbolism and metaphors addressing themes of privilege and greed. The fantastic photography, utilizing a 4:3 aspect ratio, intensifies the mansion and rural English landscapes, creating a harmonious tonal palette in the composition of images.The film's soundtrack, which I thoroughly loved, adds an extra layer to the experience, intensifying the impact of every scene it accompanies. While the movie delivered three powerful and memorable moments that etched themselves into my memory, making ""Saltburn"" an intense cinematic experience, I couldn't help but anticipate a surprising plot twist throughout. Unfortunately, the small twist towards the end turned out to be somewhat predictable, leaving room for improvement in that aspect.","

",diablogtr7,02-Feb-24,"This movie is excessively revolting and repulsive for the sole purpose of being so. The shocking scenes serve no real purpose other than to disgust the audience. Its one of the worst movies I have ever seen imo, and it showcases the absolute degeneracy of modern cinema.There is not a single redeeming quality about it, and it leaves you feeling like you need to take 2 showers in a row. The 'twist' is not even that, any one could see it a mile away. How this crap gets any recognition or praise is really beyond me.I would recommend avoiding it at all costs and not believing any hype about this trash.","

Yeah, it's emotion which brings about sympathy for the Oliver character in the beginning and then his decline into psychological madness, well, I never saw it coming. I love it when stories surprise me.Felix is a lovely character however his family is a buffet of wealth snobbery and it's bloody good fun to watch. The music is really nice too! I have to add that I adored the final scene. It is delicious!!!!The acting is superb on all accounts. The writing is excellent.

Saltburn," Not Made for the Weak!!
",aeileea,28-Jan-24,"This movie made me recollect myself on several occasions. Although several disturbing scenes, some very sexual and some with just sexual undertones, this movie is not made for younger audiences. The bathtub scene, the vampire scene, the grave scene, and the dancing scene all made me rethink my choices and then I remembered that the other components of this movie completely masked every other thing I saw unfortunately. The plot twists, although a couple were predictable, were very good. The movie has GREAT foreshadowing and the fanbase for it is active so I recommend watching it while it is still big. I'm giving it only 8 stars because it definitely made me question myself a bit, and sometimes made me feel disgusted. I was going into this movie prepared but sometimes I still was taken off guard. I'm just taking an extra star off because of the predictability. Like of course we knew Oliver was up to something... it was obvious.","

Saltburn," Well I liked it and thought it disgusting.
",wsskfqy,11-Jan-24,"I've been reading the reviews and admiring the film aficionados. They certainly know their stuff and have a lot of films to compare it to. They know the actors' previous performances and comparable films. Kudos.Unless a film is extraordinary, I will have forgotten it and its title within days of watching it. The closest I get to knowing an actor is recognising their face from another film and looking up to seeing what films they played in.Coming at it from that perspective, I really liked (and disliked?) this film. I can usually ALWAYS guess the ""bad guy"" in films. In this film I couldn't tell who was the bad guy.Oliver was creepy from the start. He was obviously obsessed with Felix. But you couldn't tell if it was hero adoration, brotherly love or lust. Felix was NICE - for being upperclass. The rest of Felix's crowd were snobby and condescending and rude, but Felix seemed to genuinely like Oliver. Whether he liked Oliver or whether it was like having an exotic pet was never clear.Oliver gets to Saltburn and this is where other reviewers seem to get a bit irate. Actually, I thought the screenwriting might be pretty accurate. The family was... well a family. A family with far too much money and nothing to do except relieve their boredom. With nothing to do and probably not much exposure to the real world, I can see a Summer there being pretty much the way it was. And with little exposure to the real world, Oliver's tales of his dreadful life (divulged to Felix in confidence) made Oliver the exotic he was.Naturally, anyone would want to stay there, with his idol, Felix, so Oliver tries to get in everyone's good graces in whatever way he can, including turning on the charm & seduction skills. Which just makes him more creepy.But it's never clear to me WHY. Because he loves Felix and wants to be with him? As a brother? A lover? To BE HIM? Was the bathtub scene sexual or trying to somehow absorb Felix's essence to be more like him?The scene with the sister could be interpreted the same way. Was he trying to win her over, help her, or humiliate her?His motive for acceptance was clear, but WHY he wanted to be accepted never was. So, logically, I at least tentatively accepted that he wanted to be included in the rich lifestyle WITH Felix, as part of Felix's life.I really liked Felix and thought the character was genuinely nice, if a bit self- absorbed. No, I don't think he was even that. He would notice when Felix needed help - and he would help without hesitation. But Felix was obviously into girls, so it couldn't have been a partner Oliver was angling for. Oliver never asked for anything, so that left a hero or a brother.I don't really want to do spoilers, though people may have already seen them.But there ARE twists that change the direction of the plot so you don't know where it's going AT ALL. I didn't see the twists coming. And every moving we watch, I guess what is going to happen and disgust my partner when it happens.The very end was lame and I don't believe for a minute that the police wouldn't have been called and Oliver found out. And even the very very end was just a contradiction. Earlier in the movie everyone had seemed impressed with his nude body.parts. The nudity at the end...it wasn't that impressive. I think the dancing through the house scene was to make viewers wonder if he had murdered the snooty butler.That's the mystery we will never get the answer to.It was beautifully filmed, beautiful costumes, great acting (except Oliver, but maybe he is really not a creepy guy and worked hard to be so creepy). Great settings and good music.Yes, there were some ewww moments. But in my opinion, they weren't there just to shock but to keep viewers confused as to who Oliver really was and what he was about.","

",TomFarrell63,21-Jan-24,"I started to watch this with just a basic idea of what it was about and found myself involved from the very beginning.I had thought the 1.33:1 screen format would bother me ,but it didn't in the slightest, the events on screen were what was important.The cinematography was superb and everything was beautifully lit, and the locations well, and the house wow!Performances from all the actors were fantastic, were they likeable...No, but that's the point, they were meant to annoy you! I assume?!I note that a lot of people say they were shocked by some scenes in this, I wasn't.

",majaguara,01-Jan-24,"The movie is fantastic. There's a definite shortage of psychological thrillers in cinema, and that's what life is all about. We are surrounded by people, hence lies and intrigues. Yet, recent years there's mostly fantasy and sci-fi everywhere. Maybe the success of this film will convince scriptwriters and directors to return to themes of human relationships. The movie is beautiful - with great cinematography, well-painted characters, an interesting story, and and great ending with incredible, daring long scene.Generally, the movie, in its' character, gives off a strong vibe of Ripley.It engages you from start to finish and stays in your mind.","

Saltburn," Great picture destroying itself in minutes
",pauvog,14-Jan-24,"Saltburn is a great and entertaining movie.It has all a masterpiece needs: great acting, and an intriguing storyline, a special atmosphere and an amazing scenery.A young and ordinary scholar from Oxford sneaks himself into an aristocrat family where he tries to please and adapt, hopelessly trying to become part of the group.Weird scenes unfold and the feeling alternates between awkward and funny. You don't really get what exactly is happening and always wonder what the story has still to offer. As other ""ordinarys"" surrounding the family get thrown out for shallow reasons and members of the family begin to die, a suspicion grows. But it's still not clear, as the main character seemes to be devastated about the death of felix. In the end everything falls apart.Ending here it would be a great movie. You could talk about what you think happened. And the discussion could begin, what it was about: I think it could best be seen as an allegory to modern day capitalism and it's mechanisms destroying everything from inside out.Also it could be a symbol for the difficulties of modern day humans to connect in a meaningful way and the somehow growing distance in a world where everything seems so close and everything can be achieved.Like that it would've been a masterpiece for me. Unfortunately they decided minutes from the end to include a flashback where everything gets explained and every ambiguities gets destroyed. A very cheap way to explain the twist, that beforehand was laid down so nice and quietly all throughout the film. Somehow the movie destroys all that for cheap reasons - ironically its fate is very similar to its characters.While i was honestly dissapointed by the ending, its still a good movie, just not the masterpiece it could've been.","

Saltburn," Gothic horror with a splash of 2007 humour
",moralpollution,25-Jan-24,"Clearly in tradition of Brideshead and other classics set in Oxford and big English country houses, this movie explores what desire looks like in stylised beautiful daring and unapologetic form.Is it over the top? Only in so far as all gothic horror is. It is also a wonderful example of a female or queer gaze and subverts how women are usually exploited by film through the male gaze (that objectifies them for titillation and profit)-in this movie we are instead treated to the freshness of looking via our main protagonist at JE's character with desire.Emerald Fennell the writer-director does not shy away from portraying want and yearning in all its insanity and crafts a narrative that is heartfelt, true and exaggerated in tragical tradition.There is also humour that balances the sinister parts wonderfully and makes it all the more real.I would agree that the ending could've used some work in pulling it all together and pacing, but that did not lessen my enjoyment of the movie by much.It is gorgeous to see a gritty non-exploitative queer story put on the big screen in an age when queer representation is still so rare for main characters and all the more so when telling not hollywood-type-Good-Guy-gay-stories that are sanitised and leave little room for grittier themes (that exist galore for straight media).I would like to reiterate how beautifully and carefully done everything is in this movie, every detail is gorgeous, music, cinematography, acting, set design, etc etc etc.","

It's filmed in a very genuine, dynamic and vivid way which creates an engulfing feeling for the audience. The acting is natural and fitting to the movie, making some of the characters seem unnatural and a bit inhumane. The movie shows how presentation and thought can really lift you to a whole new level, how wording and planning can carry you to your goals. How some can obsess over others and do anything to be closer to them, this movie clearly shows how a psychopath thinks and acts. Overall a film that I think will become a classic.","

",mr_bickle_the_pickle,04-Dec-23,"Completely unhinged in all the right ways. Emerald Fennell delivers a masterful film that will subvert your expectations.It's also beautifully shot. I also loved some of the symbolism and clues. Like Venetia spilling wine all over herself not only was a callback to an earlier scene where she gets something red all over herself but it also sets up a scene later on.The whole cast is great. I know Jacob Elordi is getting a lot of attention for the film and he is good but I think Barry Keoghan is fantastic in this. There's such a wide array he has to display. Rosamund Pike is also a highlight in the small role she has.If you're looking for a movie on the evils of wealth and what you would do for it, I think this a great film to watch. It's not always an easy watch, there are moments where things get uncomfortable. The film is kind of wild and really goes there. But, it's just a really well told story. A bit of a dark comedy with a little mystery/thriller thrown in. I think the best film of 2023 so far, honestly.","

",MOscarbradley,23-Dec-23,"If you think ""Brideshead Revisited"" by way of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" you will certainly be on the right road to ""Saltburn"" which is the title of Emerald Fennell's very dark comedy...and therein lies the problem; we have been here before though to be fair to Fennell perhaps not quite as perversely as this. It is the story of Oliver, seemingly from a broken home and fresh up at Oxford on a scholarship, who casts his eyes over the unapproachably gorgeous Felix, (Jacob Elordi, soon to be seen as Elvis in ""Priscilla""), and says to himself, 'I want him' or at least, 'I want what he's got'. When he tells Felix he can't face going home for the summer Felix invites him to spend it with his obnoxiously eccentric family at Saltburn.So far, so familiar but all isn't as it seems with Oliver, played magnificently by Barry Keoghan and cast at last as the main actor. For starters, there's another house guest at Saltburn, (Archie Madekwe as Farleigh, a petulant little snob who has it in for Oliver), but then Oliver isn't quite as backward as he lets on to be. Mooching nicely between satirical dark comedy and outright thriller material ""Saltburn"" looks, for about three quarters of its length, like it mightn't be going anywhere special; just another movie redeemed by Keoghan's acting but then Fennell gives us and the film that ninety degree turn we have been waiting for but didn't see coming so the final half hour is one nasty, brilliant hoot.Not only that, but the film's actual ending is the best I've seen this year and ten out of ten to both Fennell and Keoghan for pulling it off. If only we could have had more of this earlier on. All the performances are fine, of course. Fennell, being an actress herself, clearly knows how to bring out the best in her cast. Elordi hasn't just got the looks but the acting chops to go with them. As ever Rosamund Pike as the superficial sweetness and light
mother steals all her scenes and there's a terrific cameo from Carey Mulligan as another house guest but again it's Keoghan's film from first to last; he might just be the best actor of his generation.","

Saltburn," Deliciously wicked and messed up
",DanLawson146,18-Nov-23,"POSITIVES:1) The performances are all brilliant, in the sense that you pretty much hate everybody and that is seemingly what the film wants. I did, however, think Jacob Elordi was a particular standout due to completely hiding his natural Australian accent and through his ability to make Felix into what I felt was by far the most likeable character of the film
2) The film is hilarious in the first half. The audience I saw it with gave choruses of laughter constantly throughout the first half of the film and I really wasn't expecting it to be so funny so that was a pleasant surprise
3) The twist that Oliver has been lying the whole time and planned everything to turn out the way it did certainly surprised me. I thought he was going to turn evil but I thought it was going to be caused by the events of the film, rather than the events actually being orchestrated by him the whole time. That final scene of him will also be very memorable for a long time to come
4) The film looks and sounds spectacular. The cinematography, production design, choice of aspect ratio, score etc were all superbNEGATIVES:1) Barry Keoghan's scouse accent was pretty terrible and honestly distracting for a lot of the film. Why couldn't Oliver just be Irish?2) The film didn't quite stick the landing for me. I think it would've been better if the multiple deaths that occur were scattered throughout the film, rather than them all happening in the last half an hour or so as the film rushes towards a conclusion. Oliver goes from being cast out by Felix to owning all of Saltburn in what seems like far too short a space of time
3) I enjoyed the film very much on a surface level but I didn't really feel like the film said much of note or had much of a message. The themes around posh people who come from old money being rude and spoilt, or about how the quest for money and power can corrupt people, are all quite generic and things we've seen a lot in other films before.","

Saltburn," difficult to rate but just AMAZING
",galmariajardon,07-Jan-24,"Very VERY difficult to rate. It was complety amazing in lots of aspects. Visually it's the best movie in years. I was shock by some incredible scenes: the colors, the light, the tones, the photography and everything mixed was ALL an experienced and just for that is worth watching.The performance of every single actor is insanly amazing, specially Barry Keoghan, that men is crazy and deservers the Oscar to best performance for sure. The chemistry in screen beetwen Barry and Jacob makes everything even better, and you can feel the real conexion beetwen the characters as well.Last but not least, the script, the dialogues, the story it self: I think this is the reason of the bad score, and maybe this is the reason of why this movie maybe won't win to best movie of the year in the Oscar. Most of the dialogues are really good, they have a pinch of dark humor, criticism of society (and elites), and feelings, I don't think they're the problem. I think the biggest problem (of the few that has) is the fact that the movie has too much information all the time: things that alredy happened, things that are going on, bonds, weird behavior, objects, etc. And the writer meant to all of that to being meaningful, but at the same time when the movie ended I felt like a lot of things that happened in the movie didn't have meaninful or intension at all, which was really disappointing. Also the final was good and I must to say that I was REALLY surprised, I wasn't expecting that at all, but I felt like it could be so much more.It wasn't bad, but the whole movie WAS SO GOOD that it dederver a better final.","

Saltburn," Best Film!
",peterkettle-904-444717,31-Dec-23,"SALTBURN - BEST film for a very long time. Thrilling, funny and fierce. So refreshing to see new actors too. Emerald Lilly Fennell is an English actress, filmmaker, and writer; and she wrote and directed this masterpiece. It is partly parodic, and the reflection of Evelyn Waugh's Bridehead is consciously used. The script is stunning, and subtle. It illuminates human behaviour in the social classes and the erosion of that divide which is typical of the last seventy years. She has received many awards and nominations, including an Academy Award, two British Academy Film Awards, one Screen Actors Guild Award, and nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. The movie is gorgeously shot, the actors are brilliant and intelligent enough to know they have a wonderful script to work with0. This is the best movie I've seen for a long time.","

Saltburn," Not for the faint hearted!
",Molly_flower,10-Feb-24,"It's important to know that this movie is not for the faint hearted. It's crude, shocking, artsy, and it seems to take pleasure in shocking us to the core...multiple times! I was watching one scene through the fingers that were covering my eyes. Then when I thought I knew what was going to happen next, the wildest thing happened. Definitely not a predictable film. It's enjoyable with a lot of x-rated shock factor but if you can enjoy a movie that pushes you outside of your comfort zone then it's worth a try as Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elodi do a terrific job with their performances. And well, they bought back an early 2000's hit with Sophie Ellis Bextars chart topping hit! What's not to love!?","

Saltburn," Interesting
",LisTomk19,21-Jan-24,"Saltburn is definitely interesting, some of it good, some of it bad. Stylishly shot with a grainy old-school look to it that I liked. Better than the bright, over-coloured Netflix style of current times.Some weird moments that have been talked about a lot, but there was nothing surprising about where the story went. It was the most obvious 'Keyser Soze' of all time.Rosamind Pike did steal the show. I went in skeptical of the hype but she really did deliver.Barry Keoghan gave a great performance, although that Scouse accent slipped.Jacob Elordi was a big surprise. As a Brit myself, I was impressed at how he managed to pull off that young aristocrat, Eton educated rich boy.Richard R Grant and Alison Oliver also gave great performances.I'm surprised more people aren't mentioning Archie Madekwe though. He was the disappointment for me. Very bad American accent and unnatural performance.I have question marks over Oliver's family home. I'm not sure if it was meant to be working class to contrast the rich Saltburn house?....But if that's the case it did not work as Oliver's family home was not working class in the slightest.... Or whether the whole point of it is actually that Oliver didn't actually grow up that badly.","

",aboalhyjaa,23-Dec-23,"Saltburn is a captivating movie to watch and its a fun ride, the mixture of you thinking you have figured it out and then knowing that you didn't make the experience a whole lot better!Watching this movie i thought Its a social commentary on the British royal life, or thats what I thought. After the first half of the movie went by I started to notice where this movie was gonna go. And to be honest i wasn't thrilled about my prediction because if it were true then its just a basic story with an amazing cast to do it. Well, as it turns out it was a mix of both.The writing was great, the acting was even greater, the filming provided a whole other thing to the plate as it was also amazing, and the saltburn castle alone is just an amazing place.The ending did not in fact pleased me, it felt a bit rushed.

Saltburn," Felt like three movies in one but in a good way
",julianvr-15436,07-Feb-24,"This movie has a run time of 2hrs and 7 minutes and every minute has you engaged. I appreciated the many genres in this movie and its fresh direction to what and how they convey the narrative. The director wisely uses ""shocking"" scenes to develop characters and drive the story along and with purpose. I would put it on my top ten movies list that I have watched. This would be the only movie with nudity in my top ten(I don't enjoy shock for shocks sake unless it's a horror movie). This movie felt to me like it was going to be a coming of age story. The setting, the music, the characters, and story leads one to believe it is about friendship and finding oneself. The thing is it is more than just that and it should be watched to experience all it has to offer.","

Saltburn," Lacks a Round Table
",GabrielSymes,31-Dec-23,"It is a well trodden path. An outsider without means threatens courtly traditions; with a weak king, overseeing rebellious, dangerous courtiers jostling for position. It initially seemed like Barry Keoghan's character, Oliver Quick, a seemingly grounded Liverpudlian, would make an interesting foil for aristocratic eccentricity. Instead, as the film progresses, we end up with a mirage of sociopaths. The cast, as a whole, does very well to portray each character's flaws. But the interactions between them have undercurrents of spitefulness, in scenes designed to shock more than inform. The result is a narrative that distances the viewer and moves the collective film into the realm of absurdity. It lacks heart and soul, and by the end I simply did not care for any of them, Quick included. It's a shame. Pike, Grant and Keoghan, in particular, perform well in an appealing setting.","

",mackjay2,23-Dec-23,"What a trip, visually. The color, camera work, settings...really something to see. First time around, this will grab you and won't let go. Until the end. Maybe. I'm still thinking about it, though not sure if it's as deep as it seems. Emerald Fennell sure can direct actors and her tech crew is beyond top-level. Much of the time, this looks like an instant cult film--there is that much in it to keep you re-watching and talking about it. Barry Keoghan is perfect---really, who could have been better? He's got the right look for the character--attractive, but not Elordi-level....that keeps the initial tension firmly in place all the time. *No Spoilers*, just saying that there is more in this than meets the eye. So stick with it, if you think this is just another ""let's be weird for two hours"" type of thing. It's not. If nothing else, it's so brilliant to look at, and listen to, with great dialog. Funny as hell---has Carey Mulligan ever been more amusing? With Richard E. Grant, Rosamund Pike, Paul Rhys (as Duncan the butler) and Mr. Elordi, all in top form. A must-see.","

Saltburn," Tries to look like a film that it desperately isn't
",idanahid,09-Feb-24,"The performances in ""Saltburn"" are on point, but the film feels like a rip-off of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" novel (not the movie), borrowing heavily from its plot elements and character design. Unfortunately, unlike the novel, ""Saltburn"" falls short in delivering the psychological depth and occasional sensibility. It attempts to compensate for these shortcomings with elaborate set design.Just one example (Spoiler):
Oliver, the protagonist, who fails to have even one successful date on campus, suddenly exhibits a sexually charismatic and dominant persona, capable of bringing Farleigh Start, an alpha carefree cool kid, into submission. The scene is well-performed thanks to its superb actors, but it contradicts the core personality of the characters. The director suddenly bestows superpowers upon their underdog character, resulting in an unearned character twist. This instance is just one example of such inconsistencies throughout the film.","

",TaylorYee94,02-Jan-24,"What an ensemble. All six characters take part in and claim their roles with such distinct personalities. Two-hour just flew by because each one brings his or her story into making the whole big picture. 'Saltburn' reminds me of a few works, never meaning that it copied them but meaning that it is on the similar level with them: The White Lotus, Parasite, Mr. Talented Ripley and A Midsummer Night's Dream.Theme: The White Lotus. Great satire on class differences. Both never criticize bluntly about social class and entitlement, but capture intricate, twisted, and covert but obvious superiority shown by the upper class exquisitely.Story development: Parasite and Mr. Talented Ripley.Style: A Midsummer Night's Dream. Lighting and color perfectly portray what lazy midsummer would look like in an old English mansion. Gold and orange sunset with colorful blankets on green green grass. Saltburn mansion is beautifully and gracefully set as well. Love the art of the movie.","

And yet some of the scenes are chilling, especially a certain lunch scene after the demise of a central character.Fennel should receive recognition for writing this film, whose story is do much more original than the typical Hollywood films we are seeing.Kudos all around!","

Saltburn," Exceeded My Expectations
",kqrpsmvt,18-Feb-24,"Achievement unlocked-I've experienced Saltburn. The moment is a culmination of anticipation and finality. Saltburn was a captivating journey that exceeded my expectations.Captivatingly beautiful and hauntingly dark, this film weaves a complex tapestry of hedonism, troubling obsessions, and the stark divide between the haves and have nots. It explores themes of obsession, possession, and repression, deftly navigating the intricate dance between comedy, drama, tragedy, and cautionary tale. Every frame is a testament to brilliant cinematography, blending vibrant colors with a pervasive darkness that mirrors the film's thematic depth.While some may focus on its erotic elements, they seamlessly intertwine with the narrative and the nuanced characterization of the central figure. Far from gratuitous, the film uses eroticism as a lens to explore the lengths, depravity, and boundless ambition that drive individuals to extremes in pursuit of their desires.At its core, the main character stands as an enigmatic outlier, and a dangerous one at that, challenging societal norms and defying explanation. The film forces viewers to confront the unsettling reality of a person who exists beyond the comprehension of both themselves and society-a disturbing and thought-provoking aspect that lingers long after the credits roll.Undoubtedly, the final dance number at the film's conclusion deserves a place in the annals of cinema history as one of the most iconic dance sequences ever crafted. Its sheer brilliance and choreographic mastery left an indelible imprint, making it a dazzling crescendo that resonates long after the credits roll. Damn, it was a cinematic dance spectacle that transcended the screen, etching itself into the collective memory of all who witnessed its artistry.In the realm of art house cinema, this film stands out as a masterfully executed piece, a quadfecta of genres seamlessly blended into a profound cinematic experience. It pushes boundaries, challenges perceptions, and leaves an indelible mark as one of the finest offerings in contemporary art house filmmaking.","

Saltburn," Intriguing Rich vs Poor
",stevendbeard,24-Nov-23,"I saw Saltburn, starring Barry Keoghan-The Green Knight, Dunkirk; Jacob Elordi-Priscilla, Deep Water; Rosamund Pike-Gone Girl, Die Another Day and Carey Mulligan-Promising Young Woman, Inside Llewyn Davis.This is an intriguing story about the differences between the rich and poor. Barry plays a smart young man-but just scraping by in the financial area-entering his first year at Oxford University. He meets and befriends Jacob, a fellow student who is also an aristocrat. Barry studies hard and gets good grades while Jacob likes to party and depend on his father's money to get by. When summer break comes along, Jacob invites Barry to come stay with him and his family at their estate in the countryside. Saltburn is the name of the estate. Rosamund plays Jacob's mother, who being a little eccentric-as is the whole family-welcomes Barry with open arms. Carey is another person that is staying at Saltburn, and yes, she is eccentric too. The film is a little slow in parts but gets more interesting when the aristocrats start partying. They even dress in tuxedos for dinner, which Barry has to borrow one, to fit in. There are some twists and turns you may not see coming. I can imagine that you will not soon forget the bath tub scene-or the graveyard one, either.It's rated R for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes.It would be a good one to stream.","

Saltburn," Mirror, Mirror on the Wall....
",ThurstonHunger,26-Dec-23,"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who will rise and who will fall? Or perhaps one could call this Pan's Other Labyrinth? Moth Man, the metaphor the film itself adopts? The Quick and the Dead? Or why not another serving of the ever-popular Eat the Rich.I might have gone into this with expectations too high...I mean the combination of Barry Keough and Emerald Fennell under the Lucky Chap umbrella.The film's beckoning veers towards beguiling, and I mostly did not mind that based upon the acting. Especially the Lord and Lady of Saltburn. Hear, hear to them. Keough remains endlessly watchable for me, even if this feels like a separated-at-birth portrayal next to his work in Lanthimos' ""Killing of a Sacred Deer."" So he may be up for a change of roles, perhaps something more light in a Edgar Wright.Don't want to spoil this, I do believe you should see it. Just perhaps gauge your anticipation. It is unique enough despite some resonances to other films. I am a little curious if there is some deeper than fairy tales and sideways shades of Dorian Greys , maybe back to myths where Pan goes hunting on in the halls of Olympus.In his first scene, Barry as Oliver mentions style over substance, and that's where the movie wound up for me. But perhaps a later viewing, or reading others reviews will deepen my experience. There's a pretty painting of power as aphrodisiac, sure. Is Keough as Oliver Cromwell in a reworked modern day ""Wolf Hall"" next?As for comedy, whether of manners or manors, I didn't catch that. The outrageous is not automatically the humorous.Definitely curious what others, here and in person, have to say about this.","

Saltburn," Extremely Engaging But Not Without Its Flaws
",JICNZ,09-Jan-24,"Overall, this is a really enjoyable film. The settings are incredible. The cast is amazing. The plot really draws you in and has a wonderful menace about it the whole time. However, I do think the ending was just a little over the top to remain credible.The Kira Knightly movie of Pride & Prejudice had to be given an 'American' alternative ending. Cabin At The End of the World, which has the most wonderfully enigmatic ending in the book, is totally rewritten for the movie, and presumably for American audiences. The ambiguity of Saltburn throughout is its great charm, and yet in the last minute we have stuff we suspected and feared laid out for us. The mystique was lost. How much more subtle it would have been to have Oliver enigmatically mention to someone that he was rather good with bicycles, or that, indeed, being able to make yourself sick was a very useful trick...
That aside, I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes complex psychological twisters.","

Saltburn," Not as ""shocking"" or ""disturbing"" as many would lead you to believe, but still a great movie.
",manuelasaez,22-Dec-23,"I went into this movie after reading a few of the reviews here calling this movie ""shocking"" and ""disturbing"" and ""will leave you gasping in disbelief"". Did I watch a completely different movie, because all I got were some mildly gross scenes with bodily functions, and a cliched ""rich people are awful"" script that tried really hard to be clever and unique but ended up being derivative of much better movies of its ilk. Honestly, I was expecting so much more debauchery and a much more jaw-dropping experience, but if people really thought that this movie was anything of the sort, you really need to watch more movies. Perhaps the cinema of South Korea can teach you how ""shocking"" movies can really get. *rolls eyes*I will say this, while directorial style and the script were....amusing, to say the least, the cinematography and the acting were all top notch. There is some serious talent in this film, and every single actor played their character with such undeniable skill, that you really started to hate each and every one of them by the end of the movie. All except Oliver. Good ol' Ollie....Seriously, if there was one person that could have carried this film on his own, it was Barry Keoghan. Man, what an actor. Not only is he the best eye candy in the entire movie (wait until the end, he is literally a dream boat from every angle imaginable), his acting was above and beyond anything that I expected from this movie and made me an instant fan. The fact that he can play such a seemingly innocent character and change up so easily is a true testament to his ability, and I truly believe that he deserves to be a gotdamn STAR. This movie would not have been the same without him, and whoever cast him in the role knew exactly what they were doing. Kudos to the casting director and kudos to the actual director for knowing just what we all wanted to see.In the end, the movie went exactly where I knew it was going to go. It didn't shock or surprise me, it barely made me gag, but it did get quite a few chuckles out of me. Overall, it's an extremely solid and well made film that relied to heavily on its messaging and not enough on its story. I'm just glad that no ""woke"" nonsense was injected anywhere. I avoid Western movies like the plague due to the ideology, so it was refreshing seeing something not be made insufferable by having that toxic nonsense vomited all over it.","

",henry8-3,26-Dec-23,"Barry Keoghan is Oliver, a shy but smart Oxford student who makes friend with much loved and filthy rich Felix (Jacob Elordi). When Oliver tells Felix that his parents are drug addicts and later that his father has died, Felix takes him under his wing and invites him to stay at the servant heavy family pile chocked full of eccentric characters including parents Richard E Grant and Rosamund Pike, where Oliver slowly starts to fit in.The British class system with all its often vulgar habits and eccentricities has always provided rich pickings for dark comedy and indeed many are to be found here. The house members are pretty much all off their rockers offering, particularly from Grant and Pike some joyously insane banter often around their indifference to people and their need to follow tradition. The tone of the film does not entirely unexpectedly shift somewhat in the last 45 minutes leading to a particularly dark but enjoyable third act, lead throughout by a fine central turn by Keoghan. I guess the whole thing could have been a little shorter and a little more caustic humour at the expense of some of the drama wouldn't have gone a miss, but it's still a fun dark piece.","

",alextheweirdo-55048,13-Jan-24,"I've heard about this movie on Tiktok, never a good start but I decided to give it a watch anyways. The first half an hour was a rush and filled with cliches; sad looser meets rich popular boy. What could've been a great start for the rest of the movie and could have established the relationships of the characters came to short and relies on the watcher already being familiar with these clichés. For me it got really interesting after that; the actors managed to beautifully and realistically portray these people in the second part, but sadly then again the third act lay low. In act two, interest was build up but the movie just never came to any sort of climax. After the characters find out The-Dramatic-Secrets, it feels like nothing happens. Still, the movie had it's great scenes. I enjoyed how they dared to try things, the nude scenes really managed to make the viewer uncomfortable. Furthermore, the actors were incredible. Before this movie, I've only known Jacob Elordi from movies like 'the kissing booth' and made the mistake to not differentiate between actor and character, because although he's still a popular guy in this role, he managed to portray a beautiful new and naive character, but also Berry Keoghan had his stunning scenes, as disgusting as they were, they were absolutely stunning. Another thing I greatly appreciated was the way the movie was filmed; soundtrack, camera work and cuts were used gracefully and made the movie feel kind of timeless. Overall I think it's a great movie, but I would not recommend it to most people. You've got to have an interest in seeing people naked and not have a problem with secondhand embarrassment.","

",spartanbuff,30-Dec-23,"We watched this movie, new today on Amazon Prime.It's a dark, truly offbeat black comedy-psychological thriller.It tells of Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi, students at Oxford. The latter invites the former to Saltburn, a huge estate. Elordi's wealthy parents are referred to as Sir and Lady.A series of strange turns and twists begin happening. Keoghan's lies begin to be revealed. The whole family, with the exception of Elordi, are bizarre and weird. Some kinky stuff transpires, but it is so nonchalantly addled that you're giggling through your astonishment, while conversely having a sense of revulsion.It's all pretty diabolical, and it sustains your morbid curiosity up to the shocking finale.The entire cast has a high old time reveling in their pixilated, screwy debauchery, and they make the Addams family look like the Osmonds.Top honors, though, goes to Barry Keoghan, the Irish actor playing Oliver.I looked up his bio on Wikipedia, and he apparently is hailed as one of the finest actors of his or any generation.Keoghan turns in a mind-boggling performance of such audacity and daring, the last actor I can recall who had this kinetic ability is none other than Marlon Brando.He exposes himself literally and figuratively, without flinching, because it abets the character and characterization; it's in no way blatantly showing off or going strictly for shock value - it's all flawlessly integrated in his arresting portrayal. The last scene is just a dazzling wallop.I expect Keoghan's stature will rise accordingly. He's that good.","

Saltburn," Somewhat of an artsy fartsy film but still worth seeing at least once
",Ed-Shullivan,08-Jan-24,"Did I like it? .... YesWas it something I would recommend? .... Yes, but don't rush to go see it. Save watching this film for when you are really bored and are looking for something a bit different to watch.Remember the 1981-1989 TV series Dynasty which was about the lifestyles of the rich and famous? Well, Saltburn kind of reminded me of that old TV series where the cast members may have been very wealthy in their TV roles that they were playing and at each others' throats all of the time. In the case of Saltburn this is a story of how one filthy rich family named the Cottons who come from old generational inherited money and have never had to worry about anything but how to entertain each other at their Saltburn estate.Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) who attends a very private and prestigious University takes a fancy to a somewhat awkward and under privileged classmate named Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan). When there is a school break Felix feels empathy for his new friend Oliver and invites him to stay at his Saltburn estate with his own family since Oliver's own family is severely broken both mentally and financially.This film as I have said earlier is a somewhat artsy fartsy type of film with a decent music score and an opulent backdrop of the Saltburn estate. Something of a film that the majority of movie goers will never in their lifetime (including myself) ever have a chance of spending weeks at a time being served hand and foot by a string of butlers and chefs.The storyline continues to compare the far reaching and diverse backgrounds of the two University students Felix Cotton and Oliver Quick. There are a few twists and turns which any decent film needs to include if the director wishes to hold his/her audience's attention.I give the film a decent enough 6 out of 10 IMDb review rating, but any higher of a rating would just be me trying to embellish a standard film into something more than it is just like the wealthy Cotton family does.","

Saltburn," Are you English ? Have you rubbed shoulders with these people ?
",fashinrashin,26-Dec-23,"I have , and I do wish to say there was dialog and aspects of this film that gave me the willies. You see, this is not a narrative, it is more a documentary. Emerald Fennel is showing us something.....The English upper classes ""are not like us"" and some of the screenplay had me bug eyed as to its authenticity. Much has been covered in other books and films, Brideshead, Gosford Park, ""IF"" , Another Country etc
But what Saltburn does is show you the mechanics of interpersonal upper class dynamics. And that is not pretty, but VERY on point.These people are ""removed"" from their children, and everyone else is there for their entertainment. ""The Love' is not there, there are no REAL ""externalities of endearment"" displayed by the upper classes.Emerald Fennel has cut open the upper crust cadaver and its not pretty
Another big clue about this culture is what the party-goer parent says about her kids at school at Olivers birthday party.Shudder"" !"" I get the shivers thinking about what these people really are and that I used to be among them.Fabulous acting, fab location, fab camera work.","

The grounds of the estate are well captured so that gets my 3 out of ten. The party scene is just plain silly and the last 30 minutes just didnt need to happen. The two main leads did a good job . Grant as the father was wooden when he could have been so much more. The randoms at the house just didnt need to be in the story and the staff were caricatures of themselves.Needless to say I was extremely disappointed with this film and i just did not see the need for it.,"

But again those scenes were needed to show how deep the obsession was.The film was beautifully shot and the acting was also on a par.

",donyelbyronjr,22-Jan-24,"The individuals who express their dislike for this writing and production may not have had sufficient exposure to psychological thrillers. This highlights the importance of developing scripts that are grounded in the lives, stories, and experiences of the Alpha-Zoomer/Millennial cusp generation. To truly comprehend this movie, one must have an understanding of the complexities and challenges faced by these generations. By examining how creativity is shaped by campus experiences, we gain insight into the essence of this film.It can be described as a fusion of ""Theory of Everything"" and ""Knives Out,"" delving into the concept of identity. This is how come colleges and universities need better student affairs personnel on college campuses. The film underscores the significant impact of writing, communication, journalism, and media, as portrayed through platforms like Instagram and TikTok. It is worth closely observing Barry Keegan's performance, as it is particularly noteworthy.

Having attended an English boarding school myself, it's difficult and almost inconceivable for people of differing classes to mix up so easily over a puny favour, there has to be a stronger bond but unfortunately the movie fails in this department.It appears that the detective in mid 2000s weere so poor they mistook alcohol poison and strangulation for natural death, especially when there was a whole scene about the coroner.Cinematography was excellent, that's the only positive thing about the movie.

Saltburn," Psychological. Don't let the two talked about scenes cloud your view of the film.
",tonypeacock-1,06-Jan-24,"Psychological, thriller with hints of dark comedy and gothic horror as we see the story of a supposed 'lower class' Oxford University student from a broken home in Merseyside, in the North of England being overrawed by the upper class echelons of students, one who takes pity on him and invites him to join him who take him in for summer vacation at a stately home called Saltburn.Good performances by the cast both principal and supporting members. In particular the performance of young Irish actor Barry Keoghan as Quick has to be praised.I have to discuss the aspect ratio. The film is shot in the old Academy ratio 1.33:1. The film also displays excellent photography showing the traditional buildings of the Oxford colleges, and Saltburn itself in all its splendour.It has a bit of a shock aspect with two notable scenes in particular that have really started the gossip columns going and I'm sure you will pick up on these on watching.Not quite as enjoyable (if that is the right word with these films!) as director Emerald Fennell's earlier film, Promising Young Woman (2020) which I highly recommend checking out.","

The movie is almost a hybrid of The Talented Mr Ripley with a smattering of Brideshead Revisited. The bawdiness, on full display, is almost Shakespearean, it's absolutely hilarious at times. When Oliver asks for ""eggs over easy"" , because it's a kind of American cool thing to say and impress the hosts, the butler gives him two raw eggs ! I was laughing like a drain at that point. I don't know what it is about Keoghan, but he reminds me of a young Jack Nicholson and I have a feeling he may just turn out to earn that plaudit.","

Yes, I could see the similarities w/ The Talented Mr. Ripley, but that realization didn't kick in until about 1/2 way through this dreadfully dark monster movie.At first I feared for ""Oliver."" Many scenes wherein he played the victim so well, he certainly had me fooled. Then came the infamous bathtub drain scene. I feel nauseous just thinking about it.Honestly not sure I'd recommend this movie to anyone I know. Although I loved each and everyone one of the actors and even fell in love with ""Felix"" myself, I just can't shake this feeling of wishing I'd never seen this film in the first place. That's how mean and ugly and awful it felt/still feels to me. I guess that's what it was meant to do? To mess with our heads?That one person could wreak so much havoc and get away with it is distressing. Reminds me of the old time movie ""The Bad Seed.""As one other reviewer put it, too: There's a suspension of disbelief. When the credits were running, I couldn't help wondering where ""Duncan,"" the butler got to . . . He didn't protect his employers after all his many years in their service? He didn't suspect or care to save poor ""Elspeth"" from her horrific demise? Did he, in fact, hate them all all along and hence stood back, relishing their comeuppance?I wish I could shake the awful feeling of doom that overtook me, while watching ""Saltburn.""

Saltburn," Underrated- people will love this more 20 to 30 years from now.
",Jeremy_Urquhart,01-Dec-23,"I know Emerald Fennell's last film, Promising Young Woman, was somewhat divisive, but it was one of my favourites of 2020. To me, Saltburn shows that film was no fluke, and I think it's going to end up one of my favourites of 2023. That being said, I'm sure it's also going to be divisive, if it hasn't already been divisive (I stayed away from discourse before seeing it for myself).The first half is often hilarious and sometimes quietly unsettling, and then the second half drops most of the comedy and becomes one of the most uncomfortable films I've seen in a while. I think this also might have the greatest ending of 2023 - part of me used to think Killers of the Flower Moon held that title, but Saltburn's now a competitor.Maybe I should've seen some of the plot turns coming, but Saltburn played me like a fiddle. I thought it was one thing, and then it was that thing for a bit, and then it finally kind of became something else entirely. Fennell's shown herself to be a good director so far (and Saltburn has more memorable visuals than Promising Young Woman), but with both her films, I think she's shown herself to simply be an amazing storyteller/writer. Both films are phenomenally paced, uncomfortably real at times, and unpredictable. She's also good with needle drops, most of them at least kind of ironic.And while Barry Keoghan has given several memorable performances so far (at least), Saltburn is the one where he genuinely cements himself as one of the best young actors working today. This is an amazing performance, and playing such a complex/unique character, too. I know Cillian Murphy will probably win all the Best Lead Actor awards for Oppenheimer this year, but I think Keoghan's more deserving. This is a ""star is born"" type performance - he's incredible.","

Saltburn," Overly hyped
",rachelehunteray,14-Jan-24,"There is a lot to unpack with this film. Beginning with the main character, Oliver Quick, whose personality is drab and generally unlikeable. I understand that this is the point, and that the only reason he is at all interesting as a character is due to the lies he tells and his somewhat inconsistent motivations. I had assumed, in the beginning, that Oliver's obsession with Felix is due to him falling in love with him or having a crush. This belief was somewhat corroborated by his actions (such as the infamous bathtub and graveyeard scenes). It is entirely possible that this was the case, and Oliver only killed Felix and his family due to his lies crumbling apart and Felix learning the truth. Oliver clearly fell in love with the lifestyle that Felix and his family had at Saltburn and when it became clear that Felix was cutting him out of his life for lying to him, Oliver clawed desperately at any chance to keep this lifestyle, leading him to kill his only friend.I enjoyed the aspect of having to put together the pieces to understand the whole story, and my interpretation may not be correct, as of course there are some inconsistencies with Oliver's motivations, especially towards the end. I also have to make a point that the actors in this film are incredible and portray their characters in a way that is believable and realistic.I did however find this film to be a bit slow, and dialogue heavy. Most of what this film relies on is the shock value of many of its more R rated scenes. These scenes of course received a lot of attention online, and were what hyped this film up so much. I probably would not have watched it if it were not for the hype, and these scenes that were so overly hyped where rather tame. (I may be a poor judge on this due to having been chronically online as a child and having read many disturbing fan-fictions online).Beyond these points, the ending is a bit unbelievable as you have to believe that he could get away with killing all of these people and somehow gain their inheritance without anyone catching on. Not a single person questions Felix's or Venetia's deaths or makes the connection that Oliver is in the middle of this tragedy (Someone would make the connection that suddenly the family members are dropping like flies and Oliver is the only new thing in their lives). And Elspeth's motivations for keeping Oliver around after her entire family is dead is so strange, besides why she would make him the sole beneficiary of her inheritance. She only knew him for a couple months before her family died, it's not like she had a close connection with him.Overall, it's a bit confusing how everything plays out in the end. There are a few loose ends and questions that remain unanswered, which prevents this film from rating higher than a 6/10.","

Oliver Quick who is played brilliantly by Barry Keoghan takes centre stage as an Oxford university scholar struggling to make friends, and takes a shining to a more popular lad who happens to be from the Saltburn estate. Many strange interactions happen throughout the film between Oliver and the other characters making the opinion sway on who you think is the odd one out in the film, the family or the new guy. Full of unforgettable scenes such as the bathtub, the grave and the outside romance. It is a very unique film that is 100% worth watching.","

Saltburn," Wealth does not equal class.
",okpilak,23-Dec-23,"This is a complex movie, with perhaps too many moving parts, although one gets to know the main characters well. And a lot of it is about the British class system. Felix and Oliver are at Oxford, but from quite different backgrounds. Oliver is quite smart and well read. After Oliver does Felix a very important favor, he is invited to spend the summer at the family estate with Felix. And this is no small house. And there are quite a few people staying there, family and hanger-ons. And some are written much better than others. There are some clever lines: ""Have to go to London. Funeral. Pamela. She would do anything for attention."" Oliver has a birthday during the summer, and says he can't go have it with family. So they throw a massive birthday party for him. This gets one to about the 3rd Act, and this is perhaps the most disturbing part of the movie, and one will not look at Oliver the same again. And the role of Oliver is done very well. The movie could have used a trim, as some of the scenes do not contribute that much to the movie.","

Her character only had a few lines of dialogue sprinkled throughout the film and it's easy to forget she is in the film.I knew where this film was headed the moment Oliver told Felix about his parents. This film fails to create any suspense and wasn't thrilling at all. This some how is also being considered a comedy but I can't even recall a moment that was humorous.The characters are just so shallow and one is supposed to believe the relationships that have been fostered in such little time. The nudity didn't aid this story at all, people are just nude and being weird for the sake of it. Barry Keoghan's character needed to be more mysterious. He did have a few disturbing scenes but the vibe of his character still didn't feel menacing enough.","

",jboothmillard,03-Dec-23,"I'd seen the trailer in the cinema numerous times, it looked interesting, Mark Kermode made it even more intriguing, and being produced, written, and directed by Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman) and having some good names in the cast I was definitely up for it. Basically, set in 2006, scholarship student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) begins attending Oxford University. He struggles to fit in and lacks upper-class sensibilities and the same privileges that many students have from their wealthy parents. He does have conversations with Michael Gavey (Ewan Mitchell) who wants to be his friend, but then Oliver notices affluent and popular student Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). He eventually strikes up a friendship with Felix after helping him when his bicycle wheel has a puncture. Felix invites Oliver to join him and his group of friends for a drink in the pub, leaving Michael who dislikes Felix. Felix is empathetic to Oliver's stories, including his parents having substance abuse problems and mental health issues. Felix makes a consistent effort to include him despite disapproval from his other Oxford friends, including his American cousin Farleigh Start (Gran Turismo's Archie Madekwe). Their friendship grows over the course of the year, but Felix becomes annoyed with Oliver's constant presence, and they have a small spat. One night, Oliver learns that his father has died and shows up distraught at Felix's door. Felix comforts him, and knowing that he has nowhere to go, invites him to spend the summer at his family's large estate, Saltburn. At Saltburn, Oliver is introduced to Felix's parents, Sir James (Richard E. Grant) and Lady Elspeth (Rosamund Pike), and his sister Venetia (Alison Oliver). Also staying at Saltburn are Farleigh and family friend Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan). Oliver quickly wins over Felix's family, who are sympathetic to his situation and amused by his lack of social graces. Elspeth is fascinated by him as they bond together, and he grows increasingly comfortable at Saltburn. For a few nights, Oliver sees Venetia in a drunken state wandering the grounds. One night, he meets with her in the house garden, and after some conversation performs oral sex on her. Farleigh witnessed this and goads Oliver about telling Felix about it. When confronted by Felix, Oliver lies that it was Venetia who initiated the act, and he immediately cuts her out from the family. Meanwhile, Oliver's obsession with Felix grows stronger. One night, he watches Felix masturbate in the bath, and he drinks the bath water and licks the plug after Felix leaves. Tensions between Oliver and Farleigh reach breaking point when during a karaoke party they have a flirtatious moment, and Farleigh tricks Oliver into performing ""Rent"" by Pet Shop Boys in front of the family. Later that night, Oliver goes into Farleigh's room, gives him a handjob while also threatening him. The next morning, Farleigh is forced to leave Saltburn after it is said that he was trying to steal valuables from the house. Later, while Oliver is with Felix and Elspeth, she casually mentions that Pamela has died, apparently committing suicide. As the summer draws to a close, Elspeth and James plan an elaborate party to celebrate Oliver's birthday. The morning of the party, Felix surprises Oliver after organising to visit his estranged mother Paula (Dorothy Atkinson), answering a call from her on his phone. Oliver resists, but Felix insists that he try to repair their relationship. However, arriving at his mother's house, Oliver's background stories have been fabricated: his father Jeff (Shaun Dooley) is alive, and his parents live in a respectable upper-middle-class suburb. Felix is angered by Oliver's deception and wants him to leave Saltburn after the party. During the extravagant celebrations, Oliver encounters Farleigh, who reminds him that he will always be an outsider to their lifestyle. Hundreds of guests are there to sing ""Happy Birthday to You"" but it is apparent many can't remember Oliver's name. Desperate to reconcile with Felix, Oliver follows him into Saltburn's large hedge maze. He interrupts Felix having sex with a female guest who runs away, he feels hurt and confusion over Oliver's actions. Oliver tries to reason and perhaps flirt with him, but ultimately Felix rejects him and says he needs professional help. The next morning, Felix is found dead in the middle of the maze. During a tense family lunch, Oliver mentions that the night before Farleigh was taking and handing out drugs, implying a possible connection to Felix's death. James banishes Farleigh from Saltburn and cuts off all his financial support. After Felix's funeral, the Cattons question Oliver's presence, despite this, Elspeth insists that he may stay at Saltburn. Oliver mourns Felix desperately, returning to his grave, taking off his trousers and underwear, and penetrating the soil. One night, Venetia is in the bath distraught and inebriated. She accuses Oliver of disintegrating her family. He tries to seduce her again, but she is disturbed by his behaviour and rebuffs him. The following morning, Venetia is found dead in the bath, apparently suicide after slitting her wrists. James, despondent and suspicious of Oliver's continuing presence at Saltburn, asks him to leave. Oliver repeatedly insists that he cannot leave Elspeth in her hysterical state. But James realises Oliver is manipulative and furiously bribes him to disappear and never contact them again. Years later, Oliver is in a café reading a newspaper with an article that James has died. There, he has a chance encounter with Elspeth who is delighted to see him. She insists that he return with her to Saltburn, having not been there in some time herself. They spend several months together, but Elspeth suddenly falls fatally ill. Elspeth is in hospital on life support, and Oliver is there recounting all his actions. He reveals he had been responsible for all the tragedies that took place at Saltburn. Oliver deliberately punctured Felix's bike tyre in order to meet him, he poisoned Felix in the hedge maze after final rejection, he subtly manipulated Venetia into cutting and killing herself, and he fabricated the email that led to Farleigh leaving the estate. Finally, it is revealed that he planned his reacquaintance with Elspeth and that she subsequently left all the financial assets to him, including ownership of Saltburn. After all his confessions, Oliver forcefully removes the tube supplying oxygen for Elspeth, killing her. Now officially the owner of Saltburn and the Catton fortune, Oliver dances naked around the mansion to ""Murder on the Dancefloor"" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and the death stones with all family names are displayed on a sideboard. Also starring Paul Rhys as Duncan the butler, Reece Shearsmith as Professor Ware, Lolly Adefope as Lady Daphne, Sadie Soverall as Annabel, and Millie Kent as India. Keoghan is compelling as the awkward young man who lingers in the mansion, Elordi plays the charming obnoxious rich boy well, Pike steals all her scenes with her great one-liners, Grant is reliable as always, Madekwe is good at being hateful, and Mulligan's cameo is welcome. What starts as a crush and wanting to fit in with the rich people goes in a dark direction you don't expect, it follows a familiar format where the wealthy eccentric characters are all unlikeable, it is funny when it needs to be, amusingly cringey and uncomfortable in moments, and the twists work relatively well, and the final scene and song choice is genius, it is certainly a memorable and worthwhile black comedy psychological thriller.

",pinballwizard-83712,24-Dec-23,"Emerald Fennell's immensely twisted psychological Gothic drama with a dark wit is a truly compelling motion picture that is one of this year's finest.

Saltburn," Worth the watch once
",mbzpqvhyb,04-Feb-24,"I don't enjoy watching common tropes of the loser kid switching up to impress the popular ones, ESPECIALLY if it feels more real than your cheesy hollywood depictions (Generous on the ""real""). Saltburns plot is simply that but not to underplay the amazing cinematography and direction put into it. Well casted and performed it's definitely worth a watch, aspects can get dark, weird and symbolic. Personally the parts of impending dread isn't the type of ""suspense"" I enjoy as it comes off more as secondhand embarrassment. Like watching a stalker invading others privacy doesn't make for good suspense if I don't care if he gets caught and if he does, I'd just cringe out. I'm starting to understand the hype around actor Jacob Elordi who plays pretty boy Felix Catton, and Actor Barry Keoghan who treads the line of innocent puppy and crazy schemer. Always good to see the gorgeous gone girl actress Rosamund Pike who plays rich weird Mother Elspeth Catton as well as the rest of the cast did a great job performing such an unorthodox script. Director Emerald Fennel also shot ""Promising young women"" a film I have yet to see but hear good things, if this film is a taste of her style, humour and care then I definitely moving PYM up my watch list. Movie dragged on a bit longer than I expected but it was intriguing to see the aftermath. In conclusion - an interesting watch for the actors, characters and cinematography but I didn't enjoy the ""suspense"" and conclusion. Recommend to watch once, won't be back to saltburn anytime soon.""I was a lesbian for a while you know, but it was all just too wet for me in the end.

Oppenheimer," Severely overhyped
",maison-van-cleers,27-Jul-23,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",NA

Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring.

Oppenheimer," The cinematic event of 2023.
",Sleepin_Dragon,06-Aug-23,"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.","

Oppenheimer," It kept me engaged throughout...
",AlsExGal,26-Nov-23,"... and it's not like I didn't know how it ended.This was a great accomplishment by Nolan, a tremendous visual spectacle that was also very dialogue intensive. That would lead to my only criticism, which was that the IMAX cameras, which lack soundproofing but of which Nolan is quite the fan, cause the dialogue to be obscured. I had to start over about ten minutes in and turn on the subtitles on the blu ray. I don't know what I would have done if I had tried to watch it in a theater, but I digress.Cillian Murphy does an outstanding job as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. I watched a ""making of"" documentary that came with the film, and Murphy said that the vast majority of the footage of Oppenheimer that exists consists of Oppenheimer giving lectures or speeches rather than just casually talking, so that it made it hard to get a feel for the man. He uses that in his performance as you see the portrait of someone who feels and thinks deeply but keeps his cards close to his vest in most cases. He really is an enigma.The film does go back and forth in time like so many Nolan films, but I did not find it confusing like I have found to be the case in some of his other works. Maybe that is because I already knew quite a bit about Oppenheimer's life, so I'd have to say YMMV.I'd say that the real tragedy of Oppenheimer's life was becoming somewhat of a political figure while not really having political instincts himself. Because in politics, they need you until they don't, and Oppenheimer wasn't really needed after he delivered the bomb, and so he was buffeted about by the changing times and one of the most paranoid episodes in American history, the age of HUAC and the red scares of the 1950s.I'd highly recommend this film as one of Christopher Nolan's best works. There are so many fine supporting performances including Matt Damon as the gruff Major (and later General) Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. As the paranoid Lewis Strauss. The film may be three hours long but the time just flew by.","

Oppenheimer," I Wish I Could Say I Had A Blast
",JustStone,22-Jul-23,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.","

Oppenheimer," superior filmmaking and historical storytelling
",ferguson-6,22-Jul-23,"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in.""
Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023.","

Oppenheimer," No doubt a well made story, but overall, was just boring
",ryan-beauchesne,13-Aug-23,"Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting.","

Oppenheimer," An unpopular opinion from a die-hard Nolan fan
",FeastMode,21-Jul-23,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)","

Oppenheimer," Overall a disappointing experience.
",WhiteRabbitDave,28-Jul-23,"Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock.",NA
Oppenheimer," Nolan at his best!
",shivamkanodia-94992,19-Jul-23,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.","

Oppenheimer," Fission. Fusion. Oscars.
",Pjtaylor-96-138044,31-Jul-23,"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directorial decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?","

Half a point deduction.Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.8.5/10Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!","

Oppenheimer," Do the means justify the end?
",EdwardtheBlackPrince,21-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home.","

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimer (2023) The most overrated film of the year
",claszdsburrogato,13-Nov-23,"Christopher Nolan is not a director I'm as big a fan of as other people. However, Oppenheimer is a film that I was eagerly awaiting because it is something very different from the rest of the director's filmography. Fortunately, the film is good. It is impossible to say that Oppenheimer is a poorly made product. But, it's definitely nothing more than a good movie. Technically speaking, it is very well produced. The sound work is magnificent, it manages to generate striking scenes, especially the explosion scene. Nolan managed to create a well-made biography, but it is clear the effort he makes to be an artist and in the end he fails. The third act is unbearable, it's stressful and it never seems to end. Oppenheimer's problems scream in your face that they are there, not allowing only the technical qualities to shine. Some scenes are rough precisely because of Nolan's enormous effort to be an artist and not just a good director. The film is good, nothing more than that. Certainly the most overrated film of the year and not as brilliant as many are saying.","

Oppenheimer," His eyes look full of fear, regrets and guilt!
",kennedykevinr,20-Jul-23,"Imagine a fire that you brought from the heaven and you give that fire to human , and that fire is used by humans to burn this world.Oppenheimer is not an easy historical character to play, he is a historical character full of regret and guilt. However, Murphy plays this character perfectly, his eyes filled with those emotios, the way he responds to every other supporting character's utterances is simply outstanding. Even if his only response was eye movement, or a blank stare in an uncertain direction, Everything can be understood. Also, His body gestures also complement his extraordinary acting.""They won't fear it, until they understand it, the won't understand it, until they use it."" A sentence that explains the dangers of a nuclear bomb. And the way he conveyed it really looked real and as if he already understood what was going to happen.He also played Oppenheimer's flaws perfectly, He's a pretty selfish and sometimes rebellious guy. Committing adultery with a woman who is not his wife, and has feelings that are very binding with his that girl, When the woman's death, we can see that Oppenheimer was devastated.Then for the scoring, It's really amazing. First it sound so grand, The atomic bomb is a very grandiose thing, But over time the music got louder and louder, shows a very deep fear.The sound effects also produce a feeling for the audience to feel the horror of atomic bomb. The stomping of those feet against the wooden floor couldn't escape my head until now.Lastly is the cinematography, every angle is taken perfectly, the practical effects are really pleasing to the eye. The approach to Murphy's face in the final scene literally describes Oppenheimer's entire life. The explosion was also really grandiose.Christopher Nolan literally describes it all perfectly, and I have absolutely no words to compliment this man. If you want to feel Christopher Nolan's way of seeing the world, watch this film. 3 hours passed without getting bored, like only an hour.That is all from me. Thank you.","

I can't help feel the same. I have a strong background in nuclear physics. It was intriguing, but it was cut so jarringly that it was hard to keep up what was going on.Then finally, we have the big event that everyone was selling this movie on, and it was quite underwhelming. The characters don't do enough to catch my feelings. The only standouts for me were Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt, but RDJ's whole character arc was that he was insecure and just wanted petty revenge??The whole last hour I was checking the time hoping it would end, because I was just bored.","

Oppenheimer," Pearls before swine
",shanayneigh,04-Aug-23,"First of all, I love Christoper Nolan's work. He's the only director whose films I always see in a cinema. But it's clear that he's is now so powerful that no one has the guts to tell him no. He's almost the Stephen King of film making these days, with the end results too often overly long and meandering. Perhaps my Nolan cinema-first policy will end after Oppenheimer.I remember how the filmmakers in the special features to The Godfather Part II (1974) discussed that it took a long time for them in editing to figure out how often they should switch between the different time periods. Clearly no one bothered to ponder this question in the editing of Oppenheimer. We jump backwards and forwards in time so frequently that no scene has time to breathe. This movie manages the almost impossible. It's simultaneously rushed and plodding.Nolan falls into his regular trap of telling instead of showing.We're told by other characters that Oppenheimer's a genius. The evidence we've been shown to support this claim is him dropping a beaker in class and not much else. Compare this to A Beautiful Mind (2001) where they try to illustrate how the mind of that main character works. In Oppenheimer that's substituted with blurry macro photography.Two hours into the movie we are also told by one character that Oppenheimer is a womanizer. At this point he has been shown to have had two women. Again, show us, don't tell us.Filming the entire movie in IMAX was truly casting pearls before swine. The huge format added nothing (except production costs I imagine). It reminded me of The Hateful Eight (2015). I was so excited that Tarantino was going to shoot a Western on 65mm, a perfect format for glorious vistas. And then they were outside for like the first five minutes of the movie and spent the rest inside a little log cabin. The same holds true for Oppenheimer, which is 95% dialogue scenes in tight quarters making the IMAX format completely and utterly useless.As for the explosion of the bomb, which occurs around the two-hour mark, I have to say that it was quite underwhelming. Mad respect for Nolan's ambition to not use CG, but perhaps sometimes it's justified. The explosion in the opening of Apocalypse Now (1979) and at the end of Blown Away (1994) looked more impressive than the one in Oppenheimer, which is covered mostly in closeups anyway.The supposed reveals in the end about Strauss' being the secret puppet master behind Oppenheimer's faux trial and the contents of the conversation between the latter and Einstein were, in the case of the former telegraphed so far in advance one can only wonder why Nolan treated it as a reveal, and as for the latter the only appropriate response in a shrugging of the shoulders. For anyone with the slightest bit of knowledge of the atomic bomb program, Einstein's views are well known, and we had already seen plenty of examples of Strauss' vanity in the preceding three hours. But no Nolan movie without an attempt at a plot twist, amirite??As for the results of the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we are shown nothing. Some abstract numbers are discussed, and the only visual reference we get is of Oppenheimer's face watching a newsreel. For anyone interested in an account written only a year after the bombing I would recommend Hiroshima by John Hersey (available for free online in The New Yorker). Or better yet, visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum which is outstanding.Funnily enough, this movie is carefully toeing the line of decades long American propaganda where the bomb is presented as an alternative to invasion, which is claimed to have saved tens of thousands of American lives (by now the figure mentioned if often in the millions). I would urge anyone interested in this to read Hiroshima Nagasaki by Paul Ham which is an extensive study of the development of the nuclear bomb program. The bomb was never an alternative to invasion, it was a complement. And the Japanese leadership didn't even consider the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The reason they surrendered to the Americans was because the Soviet Union opened up a front against Japan which threatened not only their colonies in Manchuria and Korea, but also Hokkaido in Japan proper.","

Oppenheimer," due to timeline jumping it is exhausting to watch
",LauraAnnG,17-Feb-24,"I sometimes struggle with movies that jump around in the space/time continuum. And that happened here. It takes effort to figure out what is going on. It becomes exhausting dealing with the timeline jumps.I do like Nolan's films and was ready to like this a lot.I'm sure most of you have seen this movie already...
The actor who plays Oppenheimer is very strange looking and that also took some of my attention. I am the last to judge but he's just very weird with eyes and a face that always looks surprised.Anyway, I wasn't enjoying it all that much until it got near the ending when Rami Malek shows up and the point of it suddenly clicked into place.It's not so much a science history movie as a political drama. Duh.Because it is theoretically about history and a very interesting time and event, I should have just loved this movie, and I don't know what it was that made it such a chore to watch other than it told much of its story via what happens in two hearings (one public, one private). Perhaps I am getting old and grumpy.As it got to the end and the ""clicking into place"" happened, I thought I should watch it again.. but at 3 hours? I doubt that I will. It is a long movie, to be sure, but weirdly the development of the bomb seems pretty fast. There's a disconnect there.It is worth mentioning Robert Downy Jr at this point. He's wonderful as the ""heavy"". I miss him in the MCU movies. In fact, I miss those glory days of MCU movies... Thor and Ironman and all the rest.You don't know what you have until it's gone.",NA
Oppenheimer," They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far.
",TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,22-Jul-23,"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values).The three hours really flew by, honestly it felt like it was half the length. It really underlines how Robert felt about the nuke, and how those feelings changed significantly over time. The massive guilt he felt after Hiroshima and Nagasaki seems like the kind of thing that you couldn't possibly properly communicate. This makes it inescapable. Not everyone will respond well to how it renders visual what people are thinking, personally I thought it worked incredibly well. This does require some knowledge of World War 2 and the Red Scare. You don't need to already know how fission and the like work. That is explained well herein.I really appreciate how relevant this is. It is in part exploring escalation in war(today we're seeing it with drones - the line ""the weapons we have, we tend to end up using"" is chilling) and manipulation in politics(a huge problem right now, one of the main reasons that we are struggling to solve potentially world ending problems like climate change, despite how much we can do technologically). Some have taken issue with how it deals with Communism. It doesn't make the Soviet Union seem even remotely appealing, on the contrary, it just acknowledges the appeal of socialism, as well as the intense government pressure against it at the time. I've seen some call the sex scene awkward, when in reality it's meant to be. The reason that it's handled the way that it is is to underline how scrutinized the titular character became, and criticize that.I recommend this to everyone that believes they can handle the subject matter. 10/10.","

Oppenheimer," Musings on death and stuff
",roxlerookie,21-Nov-23,"I wont comment on Nolan this, Nolan that. I would call this movie a masterpiece because of its humanity & complexity.Oppenheimer is shown as complex, flawed, egocentric patriot. For eg, he is attracted to pretty terrible women, which begs questions about himself. He is arrogant, a brilliant scientist, and a great salesman. He is flawed, but patriotic no matter what. That makes for a very interesting character study.There's also a lot to be said about the violence, and the willingness of groups & individuals to commit monstrous acts. I am very interested in the evil within us. American crowds cheering at the death of 100k+ civilians, women going into trance because of a powerful man wielding an unimaginable weapon of death. All righteous people, mind you. The office discussion about which Japanese cities to wipe out, distilled down to a simple list of names, with Kyoto struck off because of its historical value and honeymooning there was sweet. And ofc, the responsibility of arms control.Then there's betrayal, and the system using people as cogs, with the military squeezing the scientists then ignoring them, if not actively shutting them down. And how to live a life of service despite that, testing loyalty, values, amid the power plays of groups or individuals.Anyhow. A great study of the complexity of humanity, social systems, war, right and wrong, and our propensity for evil.

Oppenheimer," What Walt's Watching
",waltermwilliams,21-Jul-23,"""Oppenheimer"" or ""How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb""In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!)
After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't.""
This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!","

Finally we get an intelligent, mature film for grown-ups, with scientific wonder, espionage intrigue & political drama all In one. Superb ensemble acting & production. Nolan's pinnacle.One reviewer said they found it a bit too conversation heavy, but for me that's no problem. All The President's Men, The Conversation and JFK are all 'talk-heavy' and I loved those too.I appreciate why many folks found Inception, Tenet & Interstellar a bit hard to follow, but I don't think this is as much of a head scratcher. Yes we jump back & forth across a few time periods in Oppenheimer's life, but once we've seen them all (only 4 or 5), it's fine.I sat in the front row of the IMAX cinema so I could feel like I was absorbed into the film. The sound design is bloody amazing and during a few moments it thumped through my body, it felt wonderful! Superb music score by Ludwig Göransson too.If there's any justice in the acting awards season, whenever they start, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr deserve a stack of nominations, two particularly outstanding performances in a film crammed full of impressive acting displays. I was also absolutely delighted to see Tom Conti back on the big screen, this time as Albert Einstein. A superb actor who I've admired for decades. I'd avoid any reviews if you want surprises on which actors turn up, that weren't featured in the trailer. A couple of unexpected cameos were lovely to see!Overall a 10/10 production, bloody loved it, going back for a 2nd viewing on IMAX after my next payday!","

",auskooper,05-Dec-23,"Oppenheimer is a good historical film. It delves into the guy who led the Manhattan project. With it being 3 hours long and having a R rating, it seems to get pretty in depth. It does go back and forth between the creation of the bomb and him having a meeting about his possible communist links in the 50s as well as Strauss meeting with Congress later in the decade. It is a movie that you really have to pay attention to to really understand. It's also good to have a good understanding of history to understand some parts. There's a couple scenes with nudity and it will seem awkward if you're a parent watching with a 15/16/17 year old kid, or a teacher that provides an in depth history class in high school (I heard the story with a parent and a kid watching with their kid in a theater and I actually actually experienced the In Depth history class in high school). Besides those parts, I find it as a pretty good historical film. Actings good and I feel like you could learn some history from it.","

Oppenheimer," ""Property is Theft""... Are you kidding me?
",schlomo-jones,21-Jul-23,"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.","

Oppenheimer," Great, epic and unique biopic but not for everyone
",851222,21-Jul-23,"Greetings from Lithuania.If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other.","

Oppenheimer," Strong middle, first and third acts are a bore
",matt-27634,22-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest.","

Oppenheimer," Another missed opportunity
",loco_73,16-Feb-24,"""Oppenheimer"" is a movie whose ambition exceeds its grasp. An epic undertaking that fails to deliver. A cinematic journey which is meant to be profound and profoundly engaging on an intellectual and emotional level, that falters and feels flat for the duration. Which brings up the next point. The movie's length.There is no reason that this film should have clocked-in at over three hours. It definitely needed to be more streamlined and concise, something that Christopher Nolan isn't particularly good at, which means that on many ocassions he tends to meander and lose focus and direction. ""Oppenheimer"" could have easily told the story in a 2 hours 20 minutes to 2 hours 40 minutes timeframe. Movies like ""The Imitation Game"" and ""Bridge Of Spies"" did so quite successfully.While Nolan doesn't seem to prescribe to the television format, I would say that, at least for me, that ""Oppenheimer"" would have worked better as a three or four part miniseries (""John Adams"" comes to mind) than a movie.I have never been a Christopher Nolan sycophant or fanboy, but I do appreciate him and his dedication to moviemaking, which for him is clearly an art form and he treats it as such. Which is admirable and praiseworthy especially since he is not wrong in doing so. His effort to always push the cinematic boundaries in clever, imaginative and intelligent ways are to be admired as is his dedication to cinema. No doubt.It's just that oftentimes he is too clever for his own good and all too often he gets lost in the weeds...where audiences can't or won't always follow, as is for me the case with ""Oppenheimer"". A movie still has to be entertaining and engaging. Therefore, sometimes ""simpler is better"" could work more efficiently and satisfactorily even for a director of Nolan's pedigree.","

Oppenheimer," Best movie of the year and one of the great war movies of all time.
",JohnDeSando,21-Jul-23,"""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far."" J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)The ""it"" is the atomic bomb, for which Oppenheimer was called ""The Father."" Writer/director Christopher Nolan has adapted the authoritative 2005 bio ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan, surveying Oppenheimer's life and especially his leadership of The Manhattan Project, has crafted a harrowing story deeply embedded in our history as Oppenheimer developed the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that helped end WWII.Yet, this film is not really about the making of the bombs-it is rather about the turmoil surrounding Oppenheimer with such weighty questions about killing tens of thousands of civilians with the bombs, whether that would force Japan to surrender, and whether or not he was a Communist.Nolan keeps it favorable to history only now and then emphasizing interactions that cannot be verified such as conversations with his wife, the alcoholic Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Murphy underplays masterfully Oppenheimer's struggles while he carefully considers each challenge, like the scientist he plays. Just as upending are the anti -Communist attacks that dogged him through his professional life.Along with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan captures the vast loneliness of the new Mexico desert using 65 mm film projected in 70mm. As in Dunkirk (2017), Nolan uses the process to mirror the magnitude of the subject and the intellectual excitement following Einstein's 1915 publishing of his theory of general relativity-it's the chalkboards that announce mankind's precipitate changes and provide the intellectual excitement eclipsing even that of the bomb itself.Nolan's mixing black and white and then color helps to relieve the monotony for some of the film's three hours but mostly shows the upheaval of his life, especially the last third in black and white, where the antisemitic Red Scare threatened his legacy as scientist and humanitarian.His turn as critic of nuclear war toward the end of his life was not without attendant compromise of his achievements. Perhaps his thoughts as he saw the first test mushroom cloud said it all about how his research for the bomb changed him and the world:""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" ""Oppenheimer"" is the best movie of the year so far and one of the great war movies of all time.",NA
Oppenheimer," People Who Change The World Like Oppenheimer Can't Not Be Complicated
",christopher-cole83,29-Jul-23,"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions.","

Oppenheimer," No CGI here, just good writing and very good acting
",TheOny13,16-Aug-23,"Oppenheimer was the most anticipated movie of the year for me. I wanted to see a thought provoking and visually stunning biography about a very controversial man, whose history I didn't actually knew before watching the movie but knew about as ""the father of the atomic bomb"". And well, I mostly got what I wanted, except the only problem is that I would have wanted that the journey getting there would have been more smooth and sharply written. I will start with the negative parts and finish with the positive since that mirrors somewhat how the movie flows.The movie is about Oppenheimer's life and that is one of the problems here. There is too much crammed into the 3 hours of runtime and not all of them seem to be useful for the movie's plot to be emphasized towards the end where it all comes full circle. The movie begins with Oppenheimer at a hearing which we later find out it was rigged from the start, but then it quickly jumps to Lewis Strauss' interview for his entrance into the congress or senate of America.. whatever... After that the movie depicts - and that done very choppy - Oppenheimer's life starting from student life and towards his work at the Manhattan project. Now, the problem is that the scenes with him as a student aren't more relevant than the idea that he hates practical work in physics which it's only payoff might be the fact that he recruits a team of scientists who do most of the practical work. But that didn't impact me whatsoever since the fact that he is still considered the father of the atomic bomb and the man who gave the world the power to self-destruct was developed more in the scenes showing his later years and involvment in the Manhattan project. The fact that these scenes are also very choppy is also not helping too much, since you have to be 100% focused on screen and even then it's kinda hard to catch everything that's happening and why is that important. I think Oppie's flashbacks from his youth as student really don't add up too much to the film aside from the fact mentioned above and aside from the fact that he met some scientists he mentions them later in the movie. Next, the other gripe I had were relationships in this movie. Although his relationship with Jane was somewhat build up by 2 scenes, they quickly have sex and then Oppenheimer reads the legendary quote ""And now I am become death the destroyer of worlds"" from a book in the middle of the sex scene. And what pisses me off even more is that he doesn't give that quote never ever in the movie during an interview. And I don't mean it to be an interview that replicates the real Oppenheimer's legendary interview when he delivers that quote. There are many interviews in this movie where Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki delivers monologues that are both grateful and warning at the same time. More on the second later... Next, is his marriage with Kitty, which is again rushed. They literally have one scene together, then they kiss and next they have kids. The problem is that you don't feel the relationship and what that did in a way to him. It's like an event that is addressed and that's that. And that's also the case for his relationship with Jane which could have even been not included in the movie and the movie would still have tons of scenes and interactions of him with communists to frame him as a possible communist mole at the end. The last thing that bothered me is that Kitty drinks and becomes tired of taking care of their child. They give their baby to his brother who was a former communist and that's the end of that sub-plot. Like the only reason for that being in the movie is to support the idea of Oppenheimer having tight connections to communists. But again there are tons of other things that frame him better than this. Like, there is no reason other than interaction with communists for Robert and Kitty to give their child to his brother for care.But aside from the bad things I didn't like I would like to point out the things that I liked. And funny enough they become more obvious the further you go into the movie. Especially if you get pass the first 30-40 minutes of choppy flashbacks the movie turns up to 10 maybe even 11 towards the Trinity test. First, what I liked was that the movie has a balanced way of dealing with the physics of an atomic bomb. You get enough to realize that these guys are physicists but at the same time not too much to get to the point where it's too hard to understand what they are talking about. And once you get to Oppenheimer finding out that in Germany the nucleus was broken first, is where the movie comes alive. From there everything seems pretty clear towards the building of the atomic bomb and towards the end of the movie. The performances are also top notch. The highlight must be Cillian Murphy who not even for a second did I see as the actor. I always saw Oppenheimer, which speaks volumes as to how marvelous he played the controversial scientist. Next is Robert Downey Jr who in my opinion is at his best out of everything I've seen him in. Emily Blunt is also great especially in the interrogation scene. Also, her dynamic with Oppenheimer is great and there are points in which he seems the weaker character compared to her, but that is only intended from Oppenheimer's part who wanted to play the martyr card, unlike 80% of today's movies in which every male character is weak, dumb or incompetent. However I digress... every performance was great in this movie, even the small parts played by some crazy well-known actors like Casey Affleck or Gary Oldman. The trinity scene was probably one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a cinema - right up there with the docking scene from Interstellar. The build-up to it, the dialogue, the rehearsals beforehand and the detonation itself are sublime. And then the best thing is that after you see the bomb going off there is dead silence which makes you realize what just happened and by the time you do, the shock wave hits you and you come back down to earth. What I loved was the fact that we see inside Oppenheimer's head from the beginning and we see him transforming from a guy who dreams atoms interactions to a guy who sees everyone possibly blowing up or melting from a bomb going off. And honestly by the end I really felt for Oppenheimer and I really understood how this man thought the world would destroy itself using his invention. And that is also helped by the numerous interviews he is shown to give during the movie in which he also speaks about the achievement they did at Los Alamos as well as the dangers of nuclear war. This really hammers down the idea of a man terrified of his own invention and of a man that will live the rest of his life with the horror of thinking that the world will end itself using his invention. And if that wasn't enough the scene between him and Einstein at the end hit that much harder. You realized why all the interrogation stuff mattered in the whole movie. We see how the politicians will use him at first, discredit him when he will not play how they want and then towards the end of his life will come back to him in honor but doing that not really for him but for themselves. I was left completely stunned and devastated and the final shot of Oppenheimer having almost tears in his eyes and imagining a world blowing up. That was the final poignant moment in this character's journey in this film. Also, contrary to popular opinion I really liked the last hour of the movie. All the court room drama really tied up everything that was set in motion at the beginning. It resolved everything in a very suited, clever and deserved fashion, offering justice but also mercy towards its characters. Last but not least are the technical aspects. All of them are pitch perfect but oh my God is the score incredible. There is already ""Can You hear the music"" floating around the internet as one of the best songs ever but that is only at the beginning of the movie. The entire film is scored perfectly by Ludwig Göransson who made possibly his best score yet, and I hope he gets an Oscar because this is a powerful haunting and musicaly rich score that will leave you humming it long after the movie ends.Still, having said all of that, I do think this is not Nolan's best film and it's probably his worst film yet, but that doesn't really mean much since this is still a great film. I am and will be a Nolan fan but even I have to admit that I have seen lately some Zack Snyder level of self indulgence at Nolan and he does struggle to write human relationships and shape characters that make you feel towards them something. Like for example there is no overarching message with Oppenheimer as a character. The only thing that you are left to ponder is the tragedy of him having to live with the image of a world burning from nuclear bombs in his head. It is impactful but it isn't something you see it being shaped throughout the movie in his character. So in that regard I understand people that felt nothing or thought the movie was empty. For me the movie worked and it worked best as a courtroom drama about how Oppenheimer is treated after he delivered possibly the greatest weapon in human history. It also worked as a powerful depiction of the destruction that the atomic bomb was capable and the effect it has on the humans that invented it or built it. Overall it was a breath of fresh air from all the bright colors, light hearted Marvel style movies we got nowadays which are also over-exaggerating with non-stop humor. Because that is all that is left for humans to enjoy in these days right? Well I whole heartedly support more grounded movies that tackle difficult historical periods or tough themes. And Oppenheimer is one of those movies. 9/10.","

Oppenheimer," I'll Bet That's Jack Quaid As Richard Feynman Playing The Bongo Drum
",boblipton,23-Jul-23,"I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. Covering almost forty years, from Oppenheimer as a student in England and Germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, Nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than I can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. And like watching Penn & Teller do the cup-and-ball trick, I see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than I recognized Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece.It's early to start predicting Oscar nominations, and Nolan's pictures have been slighted in the past. However, one nomination I feel confident about is that Luisa Abel will be nominated for make-up, as she ages her characters through their lifetimes.Nolan's movies encompass big themes and often distorted views of time. This would seem to render them too highbrow for popularity yet they are popular. They challenge the audience without insulting him. They don't indulge in bafflegab to offer a fig leaf to their nonsense, but explain things in terms he can understand (I omit TENET from this discussion), just as the scientists use language they can understand. Nolan as a film maker is the type of craftsman I try to be as a writer: engaging, entertaining, making his points without talking down, and leaving the audience a little happier and more knowledgeable than when he started. My only dissatisfaction with this movie is that he is so much better at his craft than I at mine.","

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimers Victims are barely acknowledged
",stevenmcglinchey,01-Sep-23,"For every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie Oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki died. If you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that Oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. Nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima (2005.)
That film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a Nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond.The Oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past that part of the horror story.Oppenheimer is a well made biopic of a man, or to be more accurate - a ghoul. A man who wilfully, along with his Los Alamos buddies, messed round with plutonium, mined from thousands of uranium mines to build a weapon that would annihilate the civilian populations of two cities and possibly one day humanity.What's good: A fast paced immersive movie into the allegedly tortured mind of the director of the Manhattan Project J. Robert Oppenheimer. His team delivered a fission bomb to the US airforce at the cost of $2 billion dollars. The lead up to and the culmination of the Trinity Test contains the movie's strongest moments.What's bad: The story of the creation of the worst imaginable weapon and the consequences of its use is virtually skimmed over in favour of the McCarthy era security hearing of Oppenheimer in 1954, which resulted in his losing his 'security clearance.'
The hearing, the movie shows, was secretly instigated by Levi Strauss, the director of the post war Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss who had taken over the Manhattan project in 1946, never got on with Oppenheimer, who apposed the development of the hydrogen bomb.While it's an interesting story, it decidedly distracts from the real horror of what happened to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and descends - somewhat - into yet another attempt to justify the actions and subsequent hegemony of the United States. They even manage to name check JFK near the end for a little old fashioned jingoism.It's a good movie. But it would be timely for Netflix to stream When the Wind Blows (1986) and The Day After (1983) as well as the aforementioned BBC Hiroshima (2005)","

Oppenheimer," A Long Slog Through History, But Blows Up The Quality Of the Genre
",rgkarim,21-Jul-23,"LIKES:The Presentation:
-Oppenheimer had a lot happen in his life, and this movie does its best to capture it without being too historical
-Nolan takes the underlying a story, a case, and uses it as a guiding line that helps tie together to the big parts and summarize his life. It works, and presents the evidence in this visual style and storytelling that works.-There is some Hollywood mixing that might stretch the truth, but it's balanced enough that I can't say it was annoying in conveying the struggles of this time period.-The result is a historical biography that moves, very important for a three hour period, and found myself engaged to listen to the tales of the father of quantum physics in America.The Acting:
-No surprise, this is going to be a contender for best acting, and rightfully so given the performances presented in this movie.-Every single person, big or small, has this atmosphere that works. It blends Hollywood dramatic theater with biography and conveys relationships, tensions, and dynamics that are closer to the pulse of reality than some other dynamics.-The tension of the case is conveyed in everyone, and I loved this buildup of so many sides on this issue and it worked well.-Damon is great, his range of acting continues to impress me and the way he has such control over character nuances. This pushed him to several different levels and found his engagement and evolution, quite awesome.-Blunt started out okay for me, one of my top actresses feeling a little sidelined and conveying an okay character. The later acts show her style though and I loved watching this woman deliver these lines and emotions with such a top notch level of acting that spices up acts 3 and 4.-Murphy is the one to keep eyes on though. The man's complexity has evolved way past Red Eye, his conveyance of mannerisms, quirks, obsessions, and genius creepy and yet entrapping. He plays well with everyone, hits these roles of a changing career on high cylinders, and makes a historical character intriguing to look more into.-All in all, this is probably one of the stronger qualities of the film, but there is more to dive into.The Visuals/Cinematography:
-Nolan is all about telling stories on a lot of levels, and visual sensations are a key component.-Oppenheimer has fantastic camera work, using angles, lighting, technology, and planning to find the optimum angle to give you the best of the situation.-The changing of filters for various parts adds this nuance that gives subtle changes, adding emotion and messages the likes I did not expect, while keeping me awake.-And the fact that it actively adapts to the character with hyper focus and realism, while still adding touches of grainy visuals of the times, is homage paid well.The Sound:
-Thank the Lord, this movie got the sound right and proved editing can still be done.-Nolan's team gives crisp dialog, easy to understand and listen, without getting drowned out by other sounds.-It's the Imax worthy piece of it, the musical scores adding that emotion going to do well on top notch speakers, while the resounding booms and other effects get an added life.-Another level of immersion, the movie really used the budget well to make sure you get all the information you need to follow, and perhaps cast your own vote before the end.The Story Pieces Chosen:
-For the most part, Oppenheimer's legacy is tied to the infamous device he crafted, but does that make the most interesting character for all?-Nolan seems to agree it doesn't, and like a good autobiography, finds snippets of his life to ingrain and add a bit more of the ""good stuff"" to enhance the character.-Facets of his life come into play at times, adding extra tests and impasses for him to work around while coordinating so much.-Friendships, relationships, and philosophies conveyed to some extent (though accurately I have no idea) that gives you more than just the science laden man you might think.-It works well for me and should help broaden the audience who will see that movie.-And to have details in all these components, both invention and non-invention, are finding a balance that is surprisingly well, though not as perfect as some might say.The Message:
-Outside of Batman, Nolan's work is often very much ingrained in symbolism, morals, and some assessments of characters that works.-And Oppenheimer is loaded with that. A fantastic movie that tests the fortitude of the human emotion and make us question how much we should push the boundaries.-While a tad heavy at times with some lines, the movie is beautifully done to really show the horrors of progress and the good and bads that we must sometimes weigh.-It adds extra edge to the movie, and again gives you that amazing investment for your time, which again works super well with everything.DISLIKES:More Character Balance:
-The movie has A LOT of names tied to it, and I won't lie that they aren't all in the movie to the same degree, so don't be surprised if your favorite is on and off in less than 30 minutes.-I mentioned Blunt before, but that evens out, but others, you have to be ready to hold tight to the moments they are in, and dive into books more with their engagement.-I would have liked more balance, integration, conveyance, and a few more moments that I wanted to see were absent. Inclusion would have bloated this film more, but a part of me would have loved more time with several characters.The Presentation Is Odd At First:
-Walking into the movie I asked if I had missed something.-The opening is very interesting and you have to be ready for that growth pain of the unique presentation, as you quickly go through his early life during this opening case.-About 20 minutes in, the movie evens out and I was able to understand the presentation style and where we were at. So if you can wade through the confusion at the start, you'll be fine.The Run Time:
-It's 3 hours and at times it feels like it when you hit the transition moments that are odd, which slow down the pace.-While most of the stuff is then fine, the last twenty to thirty minutes are the slow parts of the movie and felt the longest. It's important, but... it just feels bloated, long, and very drawn out, that I was ready to go.-True it was hour 5 of a movie, but there were other facets more detail would be welcomed for me, like projects and bombs, instead of seeing this complex endgame. But... it's symbolic and fitting to the story so that helps blunt the time dilation the final effects have.The Audience Entertainment?-Perhaps the last thing to bring to the audience is that this movie requires you to pay attention.-For those looking for entertainment and getting away, without the realism and politics of the world, this movie can be tough to engage with.-The flashbacks and paying attention, keeping track of the names, it's a lot and this might just get in the way of the enjoyment aspect for some, especially when paired with the run time.-Thus, the movie is good and truly an artistic wonder that sticks out from others, but a general audience may be bored and dock scores if they don't know what they are getting.The VERDICT:
Oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies of the year if not in a long time. Nolan proves once again that there is a medium of art and entertainment, and I was very engaged for much of this historical drama thanks to his directorial guidance. Fantastic acting with a stunning visual and audio collection bring history to life, and getting us engaged in a turning point of human culture. It's a summary of a tremendous man's life, and though it has some areas I want more of, did a nice job covering bases, with a little Hollywood spectacle added. True, it's a marathon and it isn't easy to hit if you are coming off a long day, one of the worst parts about it, but the pace and content are engaging to keep track of if you are looking for a deeper biographical film. Some character balance and pacing could be a tad smoothed out and cut down sure (maybe a director's cut), and it might not be the entertaining escape, but the movie really is worth the merit and praise for me given what it achieves in this genre. Teaching those lessons, with an engaging cast of characters, at a pace and timing that feels mostly complete without too much bloated feeling. Thus, my scores are:Biography/Drama/History: 9.5
Movie Overall: 9.0, maybe an 8.5 at the least.","

Oppenheimer," Not for most of Gen Z
",danielcereto,26-Jul-23,"This movie is not for people who watch the phone every 5 minutes, can't concentrate more time than a TiK Tok video or not trained into watching magnificent details.I grew up watching real movies, and I am able to disconnect from the world for 2-3 hours, and consequently enjoy a great movie like Openheimer. Are you?First, all the cast makes an acting masterclass. Cillian and Robert are incredible. Real, gritty and scary portrait of human being.Second, cinematography, music, storytelling and scenarios are simply amazing. Details counts, and here you need to watch carefully everything to understand the movie as a whole great masterpiece.Last, camera work, direction and script are superb. I was inmerse in a great trip from beginning till the end. Nolan's best movie since Batman ones.To add, I can't remember last time a movie fulfilled me as Openheimer. So, overall a masterpiece to enjoy if you love real cinema.","

Oppenheimer," Mixed feelings
",lone_samurai678,21-Jul-23,"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.","

Oppenheimer," It's okay but I'll be the bad guy that will reject this as a masterpiece most people claim it to be
",IamROCKAS,23-Jul-23,"Like many this weekend, I spend it in a pact theatre watching one of the most hyped-up movies this summer. Unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. If it weren't for this, I could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - I counted six instances before they left around the time Jean Tatlock died. I didn't check the time so I can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.The movie itself didn't meet up my expectations but I still managed to enjoy it. Does that mean my expectations are too high or did the movie simply not appeal to me? Well, let's try to answer that by discussing for whom this movie is - in other words, what's the prototype of the viewer this movie is build for. I think it would be best to start by quickly describing what the movie is about but here we meet our first challenge - I'm not confident enough to say that this movie is primarily about Oppenheimer and his quest to build the atomic bomb. No, this movie is more of a court drama with a backstory presented in stretched flashback and an epilogue under a veil of overwhelming drama but the movie also has nods to multiple conspiracy theories that were popular at the present time. The movie also mentions various other impactful events, like the McCartney anti-communist program that requires some context to grasp the the impact it has on Oppenheimer and the connections the links to communism (Elizabeth Cox case, for example) and I feel like context around Lewis Strauss is also important in order to decode some of the messages to fully understand the gravity of the situation. So it seems that the movie is all over the place with some links that require a specific cultural capital to connect all the dots. Having that in mind, I can only determine that this movie is build for those who have a wide understanding of the US history, especially regarding the context of the Manhattan project and the discourse that followed it.One thing that did bother me quite a lot was the portrait of a scientist and the science community that this movie attempts to push. It's in no ways a negative connotation but it isn't a honest one either as it's the most evident signifier of commercialization - to say it mildly, every one that represented science in some way was presented as a witty fellow that spends most of his time talking, discussing theoretical phenomena and coming to the conclusions on the dot. At a certain point doing the movie, there was a critical remark suggesting that Oppenheimer stopped being a physicist a while ago and he's more of a politician now. To some extent, I'd have to agree because most of the scientist were portrayed more like politicians. Apart from the basic quantum mechanics principles and paradoxes that we're mentioned early in the movie, most of the scientific discourse didn't have a clear message to connotate it's magnitude.On the flipside, I loved the idea how the creation of the atomic bomb in way did start off the chain event that will lead to the destruction of the world. The whole discourse regarding the moral and the philosophical consequences of the atomic bomb after the successful test was just magnificent and in a way that's when the real movie has started for me. The scenes with exquisite sound design and hallucination-like visuals of how the people in the room from Oppenheimer's perspective might look under the atomic blast were breathtaking. The ideas of having blood on your hand just for taking part in creating a weapon of mass-destruction are mind-boggling. And the visuals, the visuals at certain scenes do deserve all the praise. Although the story took too many ""off-road"" turns, at least in my opinion, I still want to commend the story to be rather comprehensible, even though it wasn't linear at all and had multiple jumps in time. After just one watch I can't tell whether the switch from color to black & white scenes helped to grasp the time jumps or not, perhaps it's just the room or surrounding or the context itself that helped connect the timeline in order, but the presentation in such of the story in such a way did help me to understand the story just a little bit better, leaving only the questions in context behind.Overall, I can't say this is a bad movie in any way possible but I can't say that I particularly liked it either. The hype for the movie was real - whether it was reddit post showcasing the massive film reel of this movie or early film reviewers portraying this movie as an important landmark in cinema - but I feel the hype also ruined the movie for me a bit as I definitely didn't meet the expectations it set off for me. At the end of the day, I'm just happy most movie snobs and just casual movie viewers can enjoy and appreciate this as a cinema marvel. Even though I don't fall into that category, I must admit that the general discourse surrounding this movie does make me happy and the fact that it made a lot of people look into such an influential figure in modern history is great too.","

Oppenheimer," Bloated, talky, unnecessarily complicated.
",heykateforever,17-Feb-24,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!! Period!!","

",SPZMaxinema,24-Jul-23,"Will some think this is boring? For sure. Will some think it's too long? Undoubtedly. But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been. This is good and informative 20th century history!","

Oppenheimer," Here he is, who has become Death, the destroyer of worlds...
",alekspredator87,18-Dec-23,"Perhaps ""Oppenheimer"" really became the main film of 2023. Several factors came together, among which the undoubtedly interesting personality of the father of the nuclear bomb, the Manhattan project, a scattering of famous actors both in the main roles and in the roles of the second and sometimes even the third plan. And of course, the big name of the director of the picture. Christopher Nolan has won the hearts of many viewers and film fans over his more than thirty-year career as a director. His track record includes gorgeous and controversial tapes. But one thing cannot be taken away: the biopic about Robert Oppenheimer is a clear challenge to himself.Nolan's project aroused interest only when it was announced that the next work would be a painting about the biography of one of the most famous people of the 20th century. I remember thinking at the time that somehow this project did not fit in with the work of Nolan, a wonderful visionary, blockbuster strategist. Now that Oppenheimer has been viewed, I understand that the director has decided to take a new step in his career. Chris decided to try himself in a different genre. And, in my opinion, he did it well.The picture covers several decades of the scientist's life, shows the busy life of a man, his relationship with his wife, mistress, and many other people, among whom the line of interaction with the head of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss, is especially important.The picture differs sharply from the usual Nolan narrative. There is no need to wait for the huge scale and splendor of Aimax filming, which the author loves so much. The film excites in a completely different way. There are a lot of characters, a non-linear narrative and two story arcs, which, as I see it, are specially created in color and in a black-and-white picture. One of them, in color, shows the subjective point of view of the main character, Robert Oppenheimer. This arch allows you to trace the story of Robert's life as the father of the atomic bomb sees it. The second one is made in black and white (or rather the absence of such) and is designed to show an objective picture and at the same time focuses on the story of Lewis Strauss. Nolan adds a bright tempo, a very large number of dialogues, fast editing and excellent music by Ludwig Goransson.Nolan's characters are lively and multifaceted. You will not be able to see outright villains and enemies here. There are just people here who have become part of history. They accomplish it by changing the fate of mankind once and for all, creating the Sword of Damocles, which to this day hangs over the whole world with an invisible tip. What was created many decades ago, that terrible weapon that is now taken for granted, may well have been created as a deterrent. But it may just as well be fatal, once it hits entire nations.All these problems run like a red thread through the narrative of the picture. Nolan shows his Oppenheimer as a man who sees in nightmares what he himself created. And the main merit of the script, the direction and, of course, the actor Cillian Murphy, who plays Robert, is that nerve, that taut string that Oppenheimer has turned into over the years. The film shows how this man suffers from what he has given to people. And if from episode to episode we see that he reacts vaguely to his offspring, which will bring death, then closer to the finale the protagonist changes, as if not giving a sign to others, but having wild pain and nightmares inside himself, imagining how he became the destroyer of worlds.The cast is great. There are a lot of famous names in diverse roles. Robert Downey Jr. Stands apart from Murphy, of course. The script disposes in such a way that the latter acts as a kind of antagonist, a person, which is very important for this story. Maybe so. I didn't see any amazing performance by Downey Jr., he might be even better, but the actor coped with this role perfectly.The painting is undoubtedly an important milestone in the career of Killian Murphy. He starred with Christopher many times, but he took the main role for the first time and, in my opinion, coped with it just great.""Oppenheimer"" can hardly be written into the best works of Christopher Nolan. The author has much stronger films, among which there is no doubt ""Interstellar"", ""Inception"", the trilogy about the Dark Knight, ""The Prestige"" and others. But this film is a message to the world that we all live in a dangerous time when it is worth rethinking the world order, where there are global challenges. The film is ready to give a strong slap in the face so that people wake up and think where they are taking us, what we will come to in the end. In addition, the picture shows how the author's name can work for him. And Nolan's original movie turned out to be so interesting that it attracted a mass consumer. The film will not give ratings to everything that was shown. This is a great move by Nolan. The viewer himself must speculate after the credits, who is who in this story, and, most importantly, what those events led us to.The painting demonstrates and declares that the creation of atomic weapons was conceived as something that would put an end to wars once and for all. Maybe so, maybe not. We will never know the true motives of the people who turned atomic energy into a dangerous weapon. However, even if we assume that this was the case, our modernity clearly shows that achieving world peace does not work. And it may never work.8 out of 10.","

Oppenheimer," Film of the decade
",hcoe-95812,19-Jul-23,"Christopher Nolan, once again, uses astonishing film techniques to embark the audience on an other worldly adventure. He brings to light the historical significance of the Manhattan project and Los Alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. By using Los Alamos and New Mexico as a film location for the film, Nolan is able to portray what life would have been for Oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the Trinity test.As someone who grew up in Los Alamos, I could arguably say that Oppenheimer correctly highlights the history of the town and the creation of the atomic bomb alongside Nolan's own creative input to emphasise Oppenheimer's story.Cillian Murphy delivers such a vast and emotionally compelling role by highlighting the moral dilemma Oppenheimer himself faced and on that we deal with in todays age.For being a 3 hr plus film the pacing is incredible and an average movie goer can endure such horror, mystery, and drama all in one storyline that fills holes at the end created in the beginning.","

Oppenheimer," A brilliant masterpiece that cuts to the core of human fear
",show24studio,19-Jul-23,"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity.","

",alexglimbergwindh,26-Jul-23,"Nolan fails at a very basic but important technique in film. ""SHOW, don't tell"".They do a lot of talking in this film about the decisions, actions and the results of what goes on in the film - but what makes the audience relate to what's going on unless you actually show the danger and the horror? Is this film made to make you think? Then they need to deliver properly. People get a HINT of the danger of the bomb but merely do clever politics around it. I'm quite disappointed in such a slow burn of a movie. What's more interesting? SEEING the results of the characters or just hearing about them in fast cuts? You decide. I love long discussions too and mindplay.Actors are great.. Cinematography is great. Score is great and the story is fantastic. The execution is just lazy and low budget.","

Oppenheimer," Complexity
",davidmvining,23-Dec-23,"There's something about how Christopher Nolan approaches making films that makes them seem incredibly ambitious. A biopic (honestly, my least favorite genre) that jumps back and forth in time between as many as four different timelines that includes the Trinity test and is mostly just people talking in a couple of rooms ends up feeling thoroughly cinematic. His approach to making films is heavily reliant on editing to feed his time-jumping sensibilities, all while he provides a very tactile physical reality for everything that plays out. It's also interesting because these things tend to try and distill complex characters into essentially soundbites, but Nolan completely embraces the contradictions of the man at the center of it, providing few easy answers (those tend to be my niggling issues with the film).The film moves back and forth mainly using two events as the springboards, the first is the hearing for the renewal of J. Robert Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) Q clearance in 1954 and the second being the committee hearing in the Senate for the approval of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) to Eisenhower's cabinet in 1959. The conflict between the two men is multifaceted and, despite some characters insisting that it's purely from personal pique on the part of Strauss, involves a lot of moving pieces that Nolan is completely unafraid of digging into the details. They range from Strauss's insistence that Oppenheimer turned Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) against him to Oppenheimer openly humiliating Strauss at a committee hearing regarding radioisotopes to Oppenheimer's automatic insistence at all times to try and influence policy leading to the sharing of nuclear secrets with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.That last one is the nucleus of most of the interpersonal interactions we watch in the flashbacks over Oppenheimer's life from his college days through his early university postings to his recruitment to lead the Manhattan Project by General Groves (Matt Damon). At all times, Oppenheimer is flirting with communism, like trying to help the lab workers unionize at Berkeley, much to the chagrin of his coworker Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) or attending communist gatherings with his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) where he meets Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) with whom he has an affair. He's constantly surrounded himself with communists, toyed with the ideology, never officially joined the party, and is happy to trust any physicist as a scientist first and foremost, even Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham) who ended up being an actual Soviet spy on the Project.It's kind of funny that the dramatic core of the film is the secret that Strass, embittered personally and frustrated with Oppenheimer for other reasons as well, secretly handpicked Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) to lead the inquiry into Oppenheimer's Q clearance, essentially turning it into a trial without evidentiary procedures. He also leaked the American Energy Commission's file to William Borden (David Dastmalchian) who wrote up new conclusions based on existing confidential evidence, sent it to J. Edgar Hoover, and ignited the whole need for a hearing on his Q clearance in the first place. It's all so inside baseball and behind closed doors, and the manic pace that Nolan sets the entire film along with his penchant for time jumping through editing makes it all really compelling.I've seen a bunch of criticism that says that the film flags after the Trinity test, and I have to disagree. I found the presentation of the culminations of the two hearings to be riveting. I also really appreciated that the film really does embrace this portrait of Oppenheimer as a complex man, that maybe some of the criticism against him was perhaps valid, especially his blindness to the politics of his fellow travelers on the left and their loyalties to an alternate mode of governance than American republicanism.Also, the middle hour or so dedicated to the Trinity test, the building of the bomb, the testing of different aspects, all while the focus never really flags from the potential conflicts at the heart of Oppenheimer's vision of the world, is great. It's this steady build, helped in no small part by the nearly operatic score from Ludwig Goransson, towards a specific goal, given great flavor by building up the near zero possibility that the detonation of an atomic bomb could ignite the atmosphere and destroy the whole world. Nolan is a showman, and he plays that up great. It's tense, intricately assembled, and really well executed.This is a huge film with the canvas being a single man. I think it approaches the portrait of him without resorting to easy answers (though Strauss ends up too easy a villain, I think, my only major complaint of the film) while dramatizing events that presented more traditionally might not have been nearly as compelling. Acting is very good all around with the two leads (Murphy and Downey Jr.) dedicating everything to portraying their characters. The supporting cast all the way down is equally good as well.I love Nolan's ambition. He's got this expansive view of how much he can tell in the cinematic form, propulsively moving the story forward at all times, making 3 hours feel like 2, all while embracing complexity in multiple forms. I don't think this is his best film or the top tier of them all, but it's probably the most ambitious and ambiguous. That's something to admire.","

This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming.","

It's just monotonous talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk=talk some more.Gone is the magic of The Prestige, the depth Inception, and the wonder of Interstellar.

Oppenheimer," It's rare that a movie of this length would keep me engaged
",Neptune165,09-Dec-23,"It wasn't just a good film, it was masterful. The photography, the script, the acting, the special effects, often practical, everything came together perfectly. The incredibly accurate historical references and their very special ability to entertain, even if in a documentary. The experience of watching every moment is almost indescribable, and it will certainly be a film that, in the future, I will watch once, twice, three, and many more times. I'm suspicious when I say this, because I'm a big fan of both Cillian Murphy, who plays Oppenheimer, and the eccentric but surgical director, Christopher Nolan, however, this one who appeared on this year's posters is certainly a heavyweight in films, which I enjoyed as much as, if not more than, the revered director's ""best work"" (Interstellar). If it were me, a simple evaluator, to describe such a work in a title, I would call it ""Christopher Nolan's Silent Orchestra"".","

Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time.

Oppenheimer," A masterpiece of cinema
",Neptune165,09-Dec-23,"I really enjoyed this movie, although it kept switching back and forth from the present to flashbacks. Usually when movies do this I notice it right away so it doesn't faze me, but in this movie it was kinda trippy. Very well put together, keeps you running in multiple timeframes. TBH, they could have ended in after 2 hrs with the successful test and it would have still been a very good movie. Went on longer than needed. The film was very loud in some parts which made it impactful but people with sensitivity to sound might want to wear earplugs. This film was very good and so important to show to a wide audience. As someone who has family that lived through the bombings in Japan, I think I was important to see the history behind the attacks. It stirred me emotionally in a way I didn't expect and I'm glad I had that experience. It was definitely heavy though.","

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimer might seem like a departure for a director best known for epic science fiction and a trilogy of comic book movies, but it's possibly his masterpiece
",dr_clarke_2,05-Dec-23,"After the time-bending visual spectacle of Tenet, director Christopher Nolan clearly fancied something different for his next movie, Oppenheimer. Starring Cillian Murphy as the eponymous J. Robert Oppenheimer, it is a biographical thriller charting Oppenheimer's life and career up to and after the invention of the atomic bomb, and it succeeds in being as engrossing as anything Nolan has made in the past.Oppenheimer focuses on the man rather than the bomb that he became famous (or infamous) for, although the two are inextricably linked. The film opens with Oppenheimer attending the hearing that revoked his security clearance and then unfolds in flashback; the hearing frames the film, with the narrative frequently flicking backwards and forwards in time as testimony is offered. Nolan wrote the screenplay, based on American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, and the narrative conceit of the hearing is subtly used to intrigue, as it assembles a picture of Oppenheimer's life and personality; the audience knows that Oppenheimer ends up in the hearing, but how and why unfolds more gradually.The actual bomb test forms a very small part of a very long film. The rest is character and dialogue based and yet remains utterly gripping, partly due to the characterisation, partly due to Murphy completely immersing himself in the title role, and partly because the political manoeuvring, military logistics and - impressively - physics are thoroughly absorbing. Nevertheless, the film starts to feel like a thriller once the race to build a bomb before either the Nazis or the Russians gathers pace, and the eventual build up to the first bomb test is edge-of-seat tense. When it finally comes, the incidental music builds to a crescendo, only for the explosion takes place in silence, slowed down and with the camera lingering on the rising column of flames; it's a brief moment of visual spectacle as impressive as one might expect from the director of Inception and Interstellar.The real-life characters are convincingly written and brought to life by an A-list cast that includes - amongst many other noteworthy names - Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss, Emily Blunt as Kitty, Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, and Matt Damon as General Groves. Downey Jr gives an impeccable, quiet performance as Strauss, the man who ultimately ruins Oppenheimer's subsequent career out of spite and who only loses his cool when his own political aspirations are thwarted. Damon is excellent as he surprisingly likeable Groves, whilst Josh Hartnett - cast against type - convinces as physicist Ernest Lawrence. Jason Clarke gives a significant and compelling performance as the formidable Roger Robb, whilst Casey Affleck is quietly intimidating performance as the ruthless Boris Pash. In a film dominated by men, Blunt and Pugh both give electrifying performances, with Kitty's withering confrontation with Robb at the hearing proving a fleeting highlight. Nolan casts many of his regular collaborators in various roles, with a barely recognisable Gary Oldman as Harry S. Truman and Kenneth Branagh playing Nils Bohr.If Oppenheimer is more character-based and less visually spectacular than many of Nolan's previous films, it is no less cinematically impressive for it. The film mixes elaborate sets, location filming, and recreations of explosions to great effect, whilst special effects are used powerfully to show how haunted Oppenheimer is after the bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. The makeup used to age the characters is impeccable. Hoyte van Hoytema provides the cinematography, having collaborated with Nolan on three previous films, and uses the camera to carefully frame the actors, frequently in static or lingering close-ups. Parts of the film are shot in black and white (on film developed specially for the movie), a stylistic decision that serves no purpose other than to grab the audience's attention, which it does. Ludwig Göransson provides the highly effective, omnipresent score, having previously done so for Tenet.Oppenheimer might seem like a departure for a director best known for epic science fiction and a trilogy of comic book movies, but it explores many of the themes familiar from his increasingly extensive body of work. It is cinema at its best and, just possibly, Nolan's masterpiece.","

Oppenheimer," Fabulous but not for everyone
",lorraineesimpson,27-Aug-23,"I am definitely a Christopher Nolan fan and loved it but if you like action this isn't the film for you. This is quite a cerebral film, you need to pay attention to what's being said. There's a lot of talking, a lot of jumping back and forth, you need your brain switched on. It reminds me a lot of JFK actually.Cillian Murphy is simply sensational in this role. Completely believable and there is surely an Oscar heading his way for this. Robert Downey Jr is also very good as is Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Watson.As ever Nolan makes great use of the soundtrack to build that sense of tension and urgency, and silence is also used very effectively.This feels more like a documentary in parts, it's challenging more than entertaining and at 3 hours it's long although I felt the time passed quickly. It's yet another Nolan film which you can't help but admire but I appreciate it's not for everyone.","

",amwilburn-60131,30-Nov-23,"Oppenheimer (2023)
Yes, to paraphrase another review, this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking, albeit with a who's who of Hollywood A list actors.The pacing is incredible, and the 3 hour runtime flies by; achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political/ courtroom drama.I didn't expect much going in, to be honest, as based on the runtime, I'd expected a slow, plodding affair with excessive backstory. I should've known better.The only complaint I have is there wasn't much emotional weight to this film; but then again, given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions, maybe that was the point.9.2/10, A-","

Oppenheimer," Good but ultimately disappointing
",amirnz,24-Jul-23,"A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.The good:
Fantastic scoreGood acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey JrExcellent cinematographyThe bad:
-Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostracting
Movie tries to pack too much into theee hour runtime and doesn't get it's priorities right. It feels like a series of ""This happened and then that happened"" scenes and a collage of everything in his life. Several prominent characters get introduced in rapid succession and they are gone before you get to know them or to care in the slightest. On the other hand the movie dedicates too much time to things like the courtroom drama and sex scenesUnnecessary sex and nudity, with all the feminist movement these days and considering we're in 2023, we surely should not put sex acenes and nudity only for the sake of it but only if they add to the plot. Unfortunately in Openheimer's case they don't. We see absolute unnecessary sex and nudity in this film that serve no purpose.One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall.","

Oppenheimer," Misconceptions blown away. A film deserving of the long running time.
",tonypeacock-1,10-Aug-23,"I admit to having some misconceptions about viewing this film at the cinema, in IMAX because of its subject matter and running time.I wasn't particularly endeared to either facet to be honest!The cast is exceptional and what a cast it is. I was just watching the film and throughout familiar faces who I didn't know were in the film appeared on screen. The likes of Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek. I could go on and on...The first two thirds of the film concentrate on the development of an atomic bomb and it's first use in conflict in Japan that effectively ended World War Two in that part of the world. (Germany had already fallen in Europe). To be honest I thought that was going to be end of the film but it still had some story to tell regarding the potential development of a far more deadly Hydrogen Bomb after that conflict and Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) unease at that potential to create a Cold War arms race.Oppenheimer's past links to the Communist Party are explored by a security hearing in 1954 that are like a courtroom (well not a courtroom) drama with some shadowy tactics by political forces as well as scientific. In essence it is that divide between the forces of the political, scientific and military/defence communities that form the backbone of the film in the final act.The timeline's switch between pre-WWII and the 1954 hearing and a Senate Confirmation Hearing which means you have to be fully engaged to keep up with what is going on. I don't particularly like multiple timelines in films but in this case they are handled well by director Christopher Nolan.The IMAX cinematography (including black and white footage pretty unique to the format thus far) shows the New Mexico bomb test scenes for the atomic bomb in all its pomp.","

Oppenheimer," Non-stop background music ruins it
",JayShermanLovitz,22-Jul-23,I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.,"

Oppenheimer," A cold, long history lesson
",apereztenessa-1,23-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. First, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. And second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. Having watched the film, I can confidently say none of those promises are true.For a Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer is very unspectacular, with only a handful of atomic explosion images, which -unfortunately- are not new and will not impact anyone in the audience. And it's also quite unemotional. You leave the theatre feeling like you just went through a (rather long) history lesson, but not particularly devastated. Because the film chooses -as is often the case with Nolan- a clinical approach to its subject, and the contradictions and dilemmas of Oppenheimer are observed the way one observes an insect, instead of a human character. It looks as if Nolan were trying to compete in intelligence with the scientists in his film. This is Nolan's consistent flaw. He is so insecure that he is only happy when he has proven to everyone how intelligent he is. To do this, in addition to the ice cold way in which he treats his characters, he throws into Oppenheimer his signature mixing of time periods, always afraid people will see him as mediocre if he ever just followed the chronological order of events. And in this case, he adds black and white to one of the time periods of the movie, which makes the whole thing a little cheesy.But as always too, Nolan shows control of the medium, and delivers some strong moments with virtuoso camera movements, broad shots and a great score. Most enjoyable in the film is the performance of its extraordinary cast. Every last one of them is outstanding, starting with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer.The balance is a bit of an average film, undeniably very long and a bit boring, despite the talent of the filmmaker and the cast.","

Oppenheimer," Good entertainment ?
",keith-hewle,11-Feb-24,"This film may be good entertainment. Good luck to all those that enjoyed it. But for me it does rather missed the mark. I appreciate it is a dramatization about historical figures.And not necessarily meant to be educational. Given that it would be better if the mind set of the scriptwriters had been set at the time of the actual events.Rather than in the prevailing environment of today.At the time of the scientific enterprise. The world was in the midst of the worst catastrophe that history had so far witnessed. The whole of Europe was under German and Italian fascist dominance.In Southeast Asia, it was the Imperial Japanese junta who were performing a similar function.Only the USSR and the United States of America had so far not fallen under the fascist yoke.Although both countries had experienced invasion.So essentially the object of the United States military. Was to roll back the catastrophe that was engulfing the world. Moral niceties and whether something was right or wrong did not enter the equation. The USA was in the struggle for its very existence.I think I have therefore given view then world which was far different to our more certain
view of it today. During the Second World War there was absolutely no certainty.Returning to historical characters. It is now widely regarded that Edward Teller and not
Robert Oppenheimer. Was the ' Father of the A-bomb ' We come away from the movie
very much believing that teller had little if no contribution to the A-bomb.Furthermore. Teller was never subject to a House Un-American Activities Investigation.Unlike Oppenheimer, whose answers to quite straightforward questions. Left a great deal
of doubt as to his loyalty to the United States.I do hope that as a result of watching this film. And having had their attention drawn to the
events depicted. Enlightened persons. We'll have a thirst to dig deeper and learn the true facts of one of the momentous events. In the life of many of us.",NA

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimer wins more by obligation, less by outstanding filmmaking
",IrateTyrant,06-Dec-23,"Usually, I like movies that have it all; comedy, horror, thought-provoking, surprises in plots, acting, etc. & Oppenheimer managed to scratch the surface of everything I like. The bombastic soundtrack swelling during moments like the atomic bomb detonation lent a huge theatric aura to the film, while inclusion of characters like Einstein made a lasting and memorable impact as well. The scenes of nudity, I could have done without, and the third act was so overwrought with the responsibility of narrating the lead character's struggles and woes that it was more than a little tiresome. Also, being that this movie was shot for IMAX, seeing it on smaller screens tends to hold screenshot decisions which while unique, are a little distractingly simplified, especially with regards to portraits of the characters, close-ups, and claustrophobia during board-room meetings and legal environments during the third act. Overall, I could hold the third act against the movie a lot, but it served a good enough purpose. I thought the scenes of devastation caused by the nuclear war and its outcome were portrayed tastefully and effectively. Meanwhile, the cogs and gears of the construction of the weapon were done with enthusiasm and an enlightened sense of urgent storytelling. This was a great film, one of the best ones in a year plagued by box office letdowns. Although I probably wouldn't watch it again, except to study Einstein's performance, it was one of Christopher Nolan's finest.","

Oppenheimer," An astonishing accomplichment
",outrunkid,29-Jul-23,"This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.After the lacklustre, confusing and very hollow experience of TENET, I thought Nolan had lost his way a bit. I assumed that, despite knowing that Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, I was very wary of Oppenheimer and thought it would not be as good as I hoped it to be.How wrong I was. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. It is an astounding work of complexity, uniqueness and originality the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan has outdone himself - it feels like every piece of work Nolan has done in the past has been leading to this film. The non-linear narrative, the visual/special effects, the character building, the story structure, all of it comes together seamlessly to create a truly awe inspiring experience.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career and one of the finest of the last few years. Every time he is on screen he is captivating, alluring and haunting. The film is properly titled - it is not a story about the bomb, it is a story about how it's creation impacted Oppenheimer and Cillian completely embodies the role. His eyes - his eyes and the look on his face allow you to view this man as a tortured soul, a man who knows he did his duty and did it for the right reasons but who ultimately regrets his life due to the legacy he will leave behind.Oppenheimer is outstanding in every regard - amazing music, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous visuals, a brilliant cast, a sharp and smart script. Oppenheimer is definitely, so far in my opinion, the best film of 2023.","

Oppenheimer," Gonna win a ton of awards next spring
",bankofmarquis,27-Jul-23,"Clear your shelves, Christopher Nolan and many of those involved in the making of his new movie OPPENHEIMER, you're going to need the space for the many, many trophies you are going to receive next spring.Based on the life of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"", J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan's latest epic is a rarity in today's Motion Picture landscape - a prestige picture, bankrolled lavishly, filmed gorgeously and populated with a veritable who's who of ""A"" list actors that tells a complex story of a complicated man who ends up remorseful of what he has unleashed in this world.And it works very, very well.Nolan regular, Cillian Murphy, is equal parts quirky, driven, determined and haunted in his multi-layered performance as the titular character - who is in almost every scene of this 3 hour film. He is fascinating to watch and his ""more internal than external"" performance draws the audience in throughout the events depicted in this film. It is the Best Performance of the career of one of the most interesting actors of this generation and one should not be surprised if his name is called during awards season next year.Murphy is capably supported by a long list of strong performers giving strong performances in roles that are much smaller than ones they normally receive. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett(!), Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Kenneth Branagh (of course, it's a Nolan film), Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich bring their ""A"" game to roles that could have been thrown away.Also, good ol' Tom Conti (one of the most interesting actors from the late '70's and early '80's) shows up in this film as Albert Einstein and reminds us all why he is such a good performer...and...wait until you see who shows up for one scene in this film as President Harry S. Truman!Oh...and don't forget Emily Blunt (as Oppenheimer's wife) and (surprisingly) Robert Downey, Jr. (as a politician using Oppenheimer for his own purposes). Both of them put in Award-winning-level uspporting performances, elevating two ""A"" list actors to the ""A+ list"".But this film is more than just it's performers. Nolan demands - and receives - top notch work from the Cinematographer, the Sound Designer, the Editor, the Costume Designer and the Composer (Ludwig Goranssson, NOT Nolan regular Hans Zimmer). They (along with Nolan) craft a beautifully made and put together film that will dazzle the senses. If you get a chance, see this film in a movie theater and, if you can, see it in either iMAX or 70mm, you will be glad you did.What holds this film back - just a little bit - is the story that is being told. Nolan (as he is want to do) plays with time and pretty frenetically cuts back and forth between about 4 different timelines to tell this story. It's effective most of the time, but at other times, it becomes distracting and....with a 3 hour run time...does drag a bit at times.But these are quibbles to a film that is ""as good as it gets"" by the BEST DIRECTOR plying his trade today. It is another triumph for Nolan and he will be making many, many acceptance speeches in just a few short months.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","

Oppenheimer," Movie which was not required
",siddharth-61578,23-Jul-23,"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar.","

Some things I did not like about the movie is the science stuff got confusing and you really had to watch and listen. Another thing I did not like about the movie was that it was a long movie. But overall the movie was really good if you like explosions and special effects.","

Oppenheimer," They need you until they don't
",nogodnomasters,11-Aug-23,"I was not aware of the Senate hearings and the revoking of Oppenheimer's clearance. They jump into the middle of hearings to start the film. There are actually two hearings, one in front of the Senate and another private room AEC hearing. This is used as a subplot as they go back and forth between the hearings and actual story. For me , it started out confusing and then it simply became annoying.I will say Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Were great in their roles. Robert Downey Jr. Played Lewis Strauss in order to create an antagonist in the film. There is also a back and forth in time between making the atomic bomb and a discussion of the hydrogen bomb. Who is their right mind makes movies this way? The film seemed to be a conduit for foreboding adages, proverbs and truisms about the future after making the bomb. If somebody ever had one, they tried to fit it into the film rather than let the audience draw its own conclusions. Cillian Murphy played the lead role, a complex character that he played awkwardly.Guide: F-word. Sex. Nudity (Florence Pugh)","

I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again.

There are some big people in this movie so I guess the draw was that this was supposed to be a big movie, however I felt it fell flat and was actually coming across very pretentious and uneventful. The music suggests that this is very intense and suspenseful but was actually quite irritating.The skipping around made it more confusing to watch and it ended my interest to where I just didn't care and was doing a word search game while watching, it's entirely too long and scattered and you really don't care for a anyone, much less Oppenheimer himself, sorry.

Oppenheimer," OPPENHEIMER:-an important and tough watch

Infact, every character in this film does his/her job perfectly. But the film stops short of outstanding due to its stretched screenplay. The aftermath of the war and the committee findings is very convoluted and boring. The last act does pick up uts place but the damage was done.

Oppenheimer," Nolan has truly outdone himself
",ishraqrasif,19-Jul-23,"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species.","

Oppenheimer," I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces
",r96sk,30-Jan-24,"Yep, a quality film.'Oppenheimer' lived up to the billing to me. Not that that was ever really in any doubt, with Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that I have seen this receive since its 2023 release. The near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever, despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesn't hold any slow/uninteresting moments - 'tis all fascinating.Ever since I found out about his casting I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces here, which is not even a tiny bit surprising - anyone who has seen television's 'Peaky Blinders', for one, would know that. Loved every single second of him onscreen.As for the rest of the cast, where do you start?! Emily Blunt is impressive, again not a shock as I'm a fan of her from other things - shoutout 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Matt Damon stars alongside Blunt in that aforementioned great flick, he himself is very good in this. Robert Downey Jr. Shows quality too. All others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it, for example Jason Clarke and Florence Pugh.It was impossible not to be fully engrossed in this, at least for me. It is not my favourite Nolan movie, 'Inception' and 'Interstellar' surpass but to be honest it's the definition of splitting hairs as his films are of such a high standard. For example, 'Dunkirk' and 'Tenet' move me less but are still ones I rate highly.Final words on this: Watch it if you get the opportunity. One of the big 'uns!","

",GabrielSymes,16-Dec-23,"A wonderfully crafted film, with a strong cast that had an important story to tell.It will not be to everyone's liking, it focusses on the science a fair bit. And it probably helps to be a little curious on how the bomb was created. On the one hand, we have science looking to undertake a big experiment, putting to test theoretical physics. On the other, political machinations that salivated over having the biggest bomb. And in amongst all that, all the personal and professional rivalries and romance you might expect.I'm pleased I watched this. It was entertaining, and it revealed some historical details I was not familiar with.

",marcelbenoitdeux,27-Dec-23,"I was immediately taken by Cillian Murphy's entrance as Oppenheimer and then the seriousness of the proceedings. Christopher Nolan has already proven he is a director for the ages. Actors bend over backwards to work with him even in small, one scene parts. Here Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck and Remi Malek for instance. But is Cillian Murphy who envelopes the entire journey with the kind of truth that makes the whole thing utterly compelling. I've loved Cillian Murphy since his miraculous ""Breakfast On Pluto"" Here he is is extraordinary. Extraordinary! Visually, the film is a marvel without ever falling into an effects-fest.

Oppenheimer," Disappointing Nolan
",BirdzOfParadise,21-Jul-23,"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed.","

Oppenheimer," Truly a thriller
",OlgaGorelik,01-Feb-24,"It never ceases to amaze me when a movie tells a story, the outcome of which is common knowledge, and still manages to be nail biting. We know that the atomic bomb will get made and, tragically, used, yet I found myself on the proverbial edge of my seat waiting to see how the test goes. What's more, I caught myself hoping that it somehow fails.It never ceases to amaze me when someone manages to make a movie about hard science and complicated history and you don't notice that it's 3 hours long. I loved how the three timelines were alternating, with the second one telling the story of the first and the third one - of the second.It never ceases to amaze me when an actor morphs from a decent man into a villain over the course of a single scene. As great as Cillian Murphy's understated, yet intense performance as Oppenheimer is, it's Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss that impressed me the most. There's a lot of known figures in the movie and most came across, unfortunately, rather flat. Notable exceptions are Matt Damon's General Groves and Edward Teller played by Benny Safdie.","

Oppenheimer," An overrated movie
",tobysen,11-Sep-23,"A three-hour-long movie, with over 80% of its plot centered around discussions at a table, filled with dialogues, not about how to make an atomic bomb, but entirely focused on politics and arguments, devoid of action sequences, and might even say, lacking a coherent storyline.If I were watching this kind of dialogue-driven plot on a streaming platform, I would likely skip through it. However, because I was in a cinema, I found myself dozing off several times.The plot unfolds within these debates, and all the scenes are quite fragmented, with each segment lasting just one or two minutes. The scene transitions are incredibly rapid, and there is no overarching narrative. The only semblance of continuity is Oppenheimer's extramarital affair, but in reality, this love affair is somewhat irrelevant to the movie.As for Oppenheimer's inner journey and his torment and ambivalence regarding inventing the atomic bomb, I must say it was hard to empathize. Due to the lack of a complete storyline, it's challenging to connect with these characters, making it difficult to immerse oneself and truly understand Oppenheimer's emotional experiences. In comparison, similar biographical films like ""The Social Network,"" which also employ a debate-driven narrative, and ""The Imitation Game"" are clearly superior and not as chaotic as this movie.",NA
Oppenheimer," Magnificent biopic
",obeidallahmohmmed,08-Dec-23,"Honestly, I had my doubts when I first heard that director Christopher Nolan was planning to make a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the research effort to develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about the race for the bomb, of varying quality. But as soon you indulge in the movie, you realize that it worth the risk.Oppenheimer is one of those shoot-for-the-moon projects that feels thrilling and wonky, brilliant and overstuffed, too much and yet not enough. As usual, Nolan's dedication and vision gave us yet another masterpiece.","

As a Nolan enthusiast, I love his works entirely, and Oppenheimer is not an exception. I love the way of portraying someone's story in that Non-linear mode where each time the audience gets the curiosity of knowing what comes next. The main thing is the ambiguity that arose between Oppenheimer and Einstein at the beginning. We are so keen to know what they talked about. It refers to the coinage of Rosebud in Citizen Kane. This is my second watching (the first one was surely from theatres but not from IMAX) and I downloaded the highest quality available to experience once more the visual and sound technical prowess. I think of the day getting an Academy Award to both Nolan and Murphy for their respective contributions to this film.","

Oppenheimer," Good work, again.
",xnicofingerx,04-Dec-23,"A time-limited insight into a life, a biopic in which interrogations for a court case serve as a framework for flashbacks and thus carry the storyline. At the beginning, there are short surreal trick sequences in between, which feel somewhat inconsistent with the concept. In addition to these spectator-orientated show values, the audience is bombarded with countless familiar faces in order to make the often somewhat dry genre palatable to the mass audience. Sometimes with a very destructive force. The concept of implementing actors from all over the world has been the norm as a marketing move for years, but why is this being done to German viewers, this un-talent in our name? Again. I feel ashamed.Back to the actual content. The central question is the responsibility of the head for the action of the hand. Oppenheimer is one of many scientists in the history of mankind who have been guilty of putting their power at the service of beasts, in this case with complicity in the death and suffering of hundreds of thousands of uninvolved souls. On the timeline of such events, there was certainly always a point at which awareness of the impending disaster sounded the alarm, but the researchers are usually at war with morals and ethics, or they misuse the blindfold of Justice. The result is what counts, there is no left and right on this path, the famous Mad-Scientiest effect.Oppenheimer receives his (just?) punishment, co-operations with villains always jump out at you sooner or later, especially if they were and are the greatest in recent world history.Nolan has once again created a film of very good quality. The first part is an exciting and interesting race for the object of desire, the second an even more dynamic and stirring one about truth and justice. Probably the director of our time, one who almost always gets everything right, but probably also because of the goals set by his producers. Freedom and self-determination are unattainable goods, and he could certainly have an intensive dialogue with Oppenheimer about this. I would almost like to say thank you to the cast, which is faithful to the facts. Here, the historical reality is not distorted with regard to certain aspects, certainly not entirely free of pressure and contrary to any current anti-film political agenda.","

Oppenheimer," A Very Nolan Film
",sonshineboy,02-Aug-23,"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime.It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.But alas I give it an 8!","

",aprilsfriendorin,17-Feb-24,"Every so often, a movie comes along that everyone seems to praises on the surface; and yet deep down, everyone also knows it's boring and pretentious. That's what Oppenheimer is. It's one of those movies you go into knowing you're supposed to like- and then when you inevitably don't like it, you feel like your taste is too juvenile or you're not smart enough. But none of that is true- it really just is a boring, dull, and kind of pretentious movie.In short, it's really just a bunch of dialogue and stuff for three hours. Nothing particularly emotional, exciting, or eventful. Some interesting stuff, but not enough to justify a three hour runtime. I fully believe this movie only got the recognition and awards it did because of a high budget and famous director/cast. Keep the storylines and dialogue but use unknown (but equally talented) actors, and nobody would care about this.This is a movie you watch once to say you did it, then never watch again.

People didn't talk that way during that period. I worked with the scientist during that time and the only swear word I ever heard was ""damn it"" The film did not accurately depict Los Alamos. The engineers ensured the security of Los Alamos by building the facility on a high plateau with steep walls, approximately 1,000 feet high, allowing access only through one road. Pine forests covered the entire plateau. No one was allowed in unless they had a Secret Clearance, and if one worked in the Labs, they needed at least a Top-Secret Clearance or higher , depending on what they were working on.","

In addition there is so many outstanding actors (some of them are Oscar winners) and you can just imagine how good the director is. A really good movie and it is worthy to watch....,"

Oppenheimer," The complicated life of J Robert Oppenheimer.
",TxMike,01-Feb-24,"It was August 1945, my own fetus was in incubation, just four months before I was born. Atomic bombs were dropped on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, three days apart. That product of the three year Manhattan Project effectively ended the war. There will always be debate as to whether that saved lives or not.While this movie is about that, its title tells us it is primarily about the man, J Robert Oppenheimer, who was the scientific project leader at Los Alamos. He was a complicated man, he was married with children but had a torrid affair with an unmarried woman. He was a scientist, he desperately wanted to solve the nuclear fission issue but he also wanted to be a voice of warning, how proliferation of atomic and hydrogen bombs could endanger humanity as we know it. That got him into hot water with the politicians of the time and he was accused of being a Communist.Cillian Murphy is J. Robert Oppenheimer and he has been nominated for a best actor Oscar. Emily Blunt is his wife,
Kitty Oppenheimer, and she has been nominated for best supporting actress. Matt Damon is Leslie Groves, the military man who had overall charge of the project. Robert Downey Jr. Is
Lewis Strauss, a politician who was once slighted by Oppenheimer and did what he could to eventually sully his reputation.Each of them gives an award-worthy performance, my wife and I think Downey's is the best of the bunch, and he has been nominated for best supporting actor. The rest of the cast is also filled with fine actors.Overall the movie has 13 nominations, including for best cinematography and best sound. I have a home theater system with a powered subwoofer that responds down into the near subsonic range of 16 to 20 Hz and during certain scenes it has sound energy that you feel more than you actually hear. Overall a great soundtrack.Yes, this is a long movie at 3 hours but it is so well made, so well acted, and so interestingly edited that it never seemed long.At home on DVD from our public library. Quite and achievement.",NA
Oppenheimer," Peak Cinema!
",redkyng,29-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer isn't a biopic, it's a journey of questions through the eyes of one person, Nolan delivered an intellectual dilemma that leaves you thinking for a long time.The Acting is aces, everyone delivered a great performance, but yes Cillian is incredible and will get at least the Oscar nomination, Damon, Blunt are fantastic and RDJ is phenomenal, finally he gets to show his real talent in real movies!!!, a lot of cameos and boy I enjoyed everyone one, but Affleck and Malek will steal the show, Gary Oldman was superb too.The movie is long but you will not feel it, Nolan managed to tell the story in such a way you can enjoy it without losing focus or interest ( make sure to stay focused, everything you see at the beginning will be needed at the end ).Music is the key ""Actor"" in Nolan movies, same here, at some scenes that were just spectacular! Best of the year till now!The way Nolan shot the Trinity test was really smart, it wasn't about the blast itself but about humans, fantastic choice in my opinionThis is Cinema as I love, everything is about telling a story the best way possible, only a few directors can still do that nowadays. The end of the movie was just the beginning of another chapter and yes it leaves you asking a lot of questions!","

Oppenheimer," An awe-inspiring theatrical experience!
",Anurag-Shetty,21-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer is a biopic of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer(Cillian Murphy). Dr. Oppenheimer faces all kinds of hurdles, both internal & external, during his crucial role in developing the atomic bomb, during World War II.Oppenheimer is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Christopher Nolan has given us another masterpiece, after Memento(2000), The Dark Knight Trilogy(2005-2012), The Prestige(2006), Inception(2010), Interstellar(2014), Dunkirk(2017) & Tenet(2020). This movie is a must watch in IMAX. You feel like you are right there with the soldiers & scientists, when they're testing the atomic bomb, during the Manhattan Project. Your seats start vibrating, the sound effects are earth-shattering & the visuals are crystal clear & ultra-realistic. This is because Nolan didn't use any CGI to recreate the nuclear explosions seen in the film. This is absolutely phenomenal! The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking. The background score by Ludwig Goransson is epic. You will be on the edge of your seat, throughout. Cillian Murphy is the star of the show, as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy expertly portrays the rollercoaster of emotions both subtle & not so subtle, that his character goes through during the course of the movie. Cillian Murphy's spectacular performance as the titular character, is the highlight of the film. Robert Downey Jr is outstanding as Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt is phenomenal as Kitty Oppenheimer. Matt Damon is fantastic as Leslie Groves. Florence Pugh is amazing as Jean Tatlock. The supporting cast is brilliant. Oppenheimer is a must watch(especially in IMAX) for Christopher Nolan fans, Cillian Murphy fans & pretty much everyone else. It deserves all the Oscars at next year's Academy Awards. We will be discussing the impact of this movie, for years to come!","

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimer is simply the best film of 2023 and one of Nolan's best works
",eva3si0n,07-Jan-24,"Oppenheimer is simply the best film of 2023 and one of Nolan's best works. This is one of the best biographies. Oppenheimer keeps the whole movie in suspense, not being a thriller. Great cast, amazing work of the operators. Oppenheimer takes 3 hours, but you watch the movie without stopping. This is the best work of Cillian Murphy, this is the best film biography that American cinema shot, this is one of the most unusual ways to tell the biography of a person in the film leading 3 parallel storylines. Oppenheimer is clearly not a movie for everyone and many will just find it boring. There's no action here, and most of the movie is dialogue. Also, the culmination of the film here is not the very fact of the creation of nuclear weapons by Openheimer, which was clearly expected by most viewers. But thanks to Nolan that there are also directors who are able to shoot at this level not for a wide range of viewers. I can't imagine how Oppenheimer can be compared to Barbie.","

Oppenheimer," Just Being Honest Folks
",JamesAlvarez520,26-Jul-23,"The IMDb community will tar and feather me for giving it anything less 9 stars, but I have to be honest here. I thought it was good, not great. It was certainly not my favorite Nolan film.That said, there are undoubtedly some amazing elements to Oppenheimer. The acting, cinematography, and music are all exceptional. I had the privilege of watching it in the original 70 mm format, which was glorious. But even with all of its upsides, this wasn't a perfect movie.Nolan's fixation for nonlinear timelines can sometimes create confusion for the sake of art. The idea of it is fascinating in his science fiction films like Tenet and Interstellar, but was it really necessary in a period piece/biopic?Mind you, Nolan's non-linear storytelling isn't limited to just sci-fi. It was done flawlessly in his film Momento, which wasn't a sci-fi movie. But in Memento, it played a crucial element to the plot. In my opinion, Oppenheimer could have been better as a single linear timeline.Finally, I thought it was a bit too long.I found myself wondering when the film would end at around the 2h 15m mark. The last 45 minutes was like that work meeting that could have just been covered in an email. There was a lot of information that felt superfluous.I know a lot of people love it, and they're not wrong. I just had a different opinion.","

Oppenheimer," Nolan delivers another Monstrous spectacle.
",banzoozalreviews,29-Nov-23,"Christopher Nolan delivers another cinematic spectacle in the form of ""Oppenheimer."" It's a very talky, dialogue-driven movie with literally no action, but you feel mesmerized, captivated, and never bored throughout its 180-minute running time. The film is patient but extremely rewarding to watch. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sound design is breathtaking, and the score is beautifully haunting - all in all, showcasing Christopher Nolan's technical mastery once again.The non-linear storytelling may take some getting used to as it centers on different important, seminal moments in Oppenheimer's life, causing jumps in the story. The movie boasts a stacked cast - so many famous actors show up, even if just for a scene, and each of them brings their A-game. However, the movie undeniably belongs to Cillian Murphy. His performance is so outstanding that it's downright unbelievable. I won't be surprised if he dominates the awards season. Cillian Murphy alone is what makes the movie stand out, and his performance alone is worth the price of admission. Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon are also seriously good in their roles.In ""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan has once again delivered a confounding, mesmerizing cinematic spectacle.","

Oppenheimer," Almost Walked Out
",jmillerjr-00983,24-Jul-23,"The love for this movie is very perplexing. I keep reading words like ""masterpiece"" to describe it and I just don't see it. What I saw was a disjointed mess! No character development and very poor story telling. I suppose its erratic quality was intentional on the part or the director (perhaps to help us into the mind of Oppenheimer), but it most certainly didn't land for me. I checked the clock a lot. Had I been watching it on streaming, I'd probably have turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so.A lot of folks seemed to have problems with the sex scenes, saying they didn't add to the movie. I actually disagree. I felt the sex scenes stressed Oppenheimer's immature attitude toward women and really his general attitude towards others. I suppose this could have been accomplished without nudity, but I thought the sex scenes made sense in the context of an otherwise confusing narrative.I suppose the acting was decent, but the script was so boring it gave the actors little to work with. It felt so emotionless and lifeless to me. Most of Nolan's work feels that way to me. Even Murphey seemed bored by the role and not always sure of the character he was playing. Emily Blunt had that pointed scene towards the end, but for the most part, I was unsure of her character and her place in the film. I'd have been curious to see this same story told by Aaron Sorkin or Ron Howard or Wolfgang Peterson. Bottom line - snore. In fact I think I did doze off a few times.","

",imseeg,22-Jul-23,"I expected a thrilling story about building THE bomb. Almost NONE of that. What the what?This is firstmost a political witchhunt story, the likes of which we can see everyday now on CNN. And it honestly is incredibly boring having to watch these ENDLESS commisions and administrative interviews of people wanting to know if they are patriotic enough or not and if they have had ""contact"" with the Russians.BAD nr 1: NO REAL THRILL or DRAMA.I mean, I was really expecting some thrilling story about building and dropping this atomic bomb, but it was 90% nothing but nonstop commision TALK and political TALK and boring science TALK. NO thrill at all in that! Only a tiny bit of real drama at the very end.THE BAD nr 2: TOO LONG, WAY TOO LONG3 blipping hours long! If you would walk in 45 minutes late into the theatre, you would NOT have missed any thing. I am dead serious. Finally after 45 minutes they actually start building this bomb, the only actual excting part of this entire movie. Then they start TALKING in commisions about politics again! (Deep sigh).THE BAD nr 3: TOO MANY CHARACTERS, TOO MANY STORYLINESThere are WAY to many characters and these MANY actors dont even excell. Even Robert Downey, who does have a prominent leading role, is not impressing me. He OVERacts.Not any good? The ONE redeeming feature of this movie is the acting performance by Cillian Murphy. He is solid. Not Oscar worthy or anything, but solid. But only 1 out of SO many actors, being good, is not okay for me.My hopes were high at the start. Those high hopes were destroyed within the first 30 minutes. It never recovered...","

Oppenheimer," An exceptional film, the best in years
",mts43,31-Jan-24,"I'm writing this review before the Oscars are awarded. I was too young in the early 50's to truly understand the dangerous McCarthy years, but I was a teenager by the time of the Strauss Senate Hearings in 1959. I remember thinking then that there was certainly a great deal of hullabaloo for a comparatively minor Cabinet post. This film succinctly details why. Besides his role in denying Oppenheimer's security clearance, Strauss was arrogant and abrasive and had deservingly gained numerous enemies. I have no doubt that Robert Downey will will the Oscar for his performance as Strauss and Cillian Murphy should also win for his role as Oppenheimer. There are many other fine performances. Jason Clarke, Tom Conti, and Rami Malek stand out in lesser roles. If you look at real life historical photos, you will note an almost startling resemblance between Downey and Strauss, and almost as much so between Murphy and Oppenheimer.","

I did read a few reviews that said the sex scenes were overly explicit and unnecessary, and then found myself surprised that they weren't at all. Don't understand how anyone could be offended by the sex in this move! I knew very little about Oppenheimer other than he was the man behind the bomb, but I found his story and the way he was treated by the American Government both fascinating and shameful of America for the way he was treated.","

Oppenheimer," Movie Of The Year 2023
",ZeddaZogenau,10-Dec-23,"This film is an event. Through light and sound effects, the audience in the cinema is made physically aware that a whole new world has really opened up with the invention of the ""bomb"". At the same time, the film is a reflection on the fact that you can never have the whole picture. It's like the overloaded bouquet of flowers on the table: some voice, a face, a situation always remains hidden.The actors act masterfully. Especially Robert DOWNEY Jr. Will stay in the audience's memory for a long time. Matthias SCHWEIGHÖFER's small appearance as Werner Heisenberg and the mention of the university in Göttingen are a reminder of the role that Germany's science played almost 100 years ago, both positive and negative. A filmic treatment, especially from a German-speaking perspective, is still only beginning to be possible. ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and BABYLON BERLIN have proven in recent years that there is interest in this worldwide. How good for us as cinema audiences that a film narrator like Christopher NOLAN, who is able to ride the tiger of the oligopolistic studio system of our day, is one of our contemporaries!At the OSCAR awards in 2024 you probably won't be able to do without OPPENHEIMER.","

Oppenheimer," One of the great pieces of cinema of our time
",srgymrat33,27-Jul-23,"I went in with very high expectations and somehow left being more blown away than I thought possible .First of all - the writing. So well scripted- the dialogue , pacing and format all played hand in hand to create an engaging and thoughtful presentation of an incredible story in a way that let you discover Nolan's impressions of the story even if you already knew about the history . The moralistic dilema and presentation leaves room to make your own conclusions , draw your own opinions while reminding us both good and evil come in all forms .The black and white filming was very well integrated and it was such a cool way to move back and forth between timelines - ultimately colliding near the end . I loved that the black and white was the current whereas the past was color . The past in color was the story as history is written , as people remember , what memory tells us as individuals. The present in black and white is a search for truth - when they collide it's a reminder as color infiltrates the present that ultimate truth can never be known .The acting for characters was astounding - you did not truly like any of them - another salute to the presentation of the premise of this movie - no clear answers . Salute to Pugh and Blunt who were absolutely astounding in the roles they played .Another huge element to this movie which deserves praise and accolades is the incredible sound production and editing . The scene where the test takes place is especially well done in this respect . The glimpses into Oppenheimers mind were also audibly very powerful and showed a broken and conflicted soul ling before the creation of the bomb .I could go on and on - but this is what film should be . Help us reflect on humanity , on ourselves and remind us that film is one of the most powerful mediums on earth .","

Oppenheimer," Masterpiece
",sinscopefilms,07-Jan-24,"It is so rare for me but I would not believe that I would go watch this movie more than 1 time. I watched it 4 times (including once on IMAX) which is 12 hours in total. This film is 3 hours long, and I can honestly say that I have never regretted seeing it more than once.Oppenheimer (2023) is not only visually impressive, but also delves deep into the moral challenges of developing the atomic bomb. The movie shows a ""crazy chance"" for morally undetermined characters and explores the inner struggle of J. Robert Oppenheimer, played well by Cillian Murphy. He did a perfect job acting with Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.Christopher Nolan's choice to avoid using CGI and green screens was, in my opinion, successful, giving the cinematography a natural and genuine quality. The practical effects in ""Oppenheimer"" show how dedicated the film is to being realistic. Nolan's talent for making visually impressive films without relying on computer-generated effects shows his underrated genius in modern filmmaking.This approach, along with Ludwig Goransson's amazing score, especially the track ""Can You Hear the Music?"" with its 21 tempo changes, makes the film's enjoyment even better. In general, the Oppenheimer's soundtrack is of high quality/ I used to listen to it frequently when the film was released. The soundtracks are phenomenal and memorable.I enjoyed watching ""Oppenheimer"" 4 times, and it made me even more curious and mindful about the story per se and Nolan's film making style. The movie asks a lot of questions about alliances, betrayal, geopolitics, and the moral choices made during war. It's a movie that is both engaging and thought-provoking, leaving a strong impact of both fear, wonder, and hope for a better and peaceful future.Oppenheimer (2023) is an exceptional film that goes beyond traditional storytelling. The movie is worth watching more than once because, first, it gives you a different point of view and helps you understand it better; secondly, Nolan used the non-linear approach of this movie. For some viewers it would be hard to comprehend the events of the story because they are not chronological. Nolan made a movie that makes and will make you think about the future.","

Oppenheimer," Epic, mature spectacle
",masonsaul,22-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer tracks one of the most important and terrifying events in the history of the world in epic fashion, creating a mature spectacle on a scale that's unheard of and feels like the culmination of all of Christopher Nolan's preoccupations whilst still breaking new ground. It's a sobering look at our impending doom.Cillian Murphy has been a long time Nolan collaborator but here he's finally given the spotlight and he's obviously amazing. He brings an incredible level of confidence to Oppenheimer that morphs into a constantly horrified and guilty presence in the later moments, able to express that fear and horror without any words.Robert Downey Jr. Is phenomenal here, it's the best he's been in ages. Strauss is a calm presence with his own agendas and a grudge to bear, a perfect way to go against type for Downey and a bold career choice following being in the biggest thing of all time (and Dolittle) that pays off magnificently.The rest of the cast is full of big names, most are only present for a handful of scenes but they all bring 100% to their roles and highlights include Benny Safdie with a superb accent and Emily Blunt who gets a standout scene when she goes toe to toe with Jason Clarke.Christopher Nolan's direction is perfect along with Hoyte Van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography that reaffirms he's a master of the craft (especially IMAX). The film jumps back and forth between two stories, one in colour and the other in Black and White that makes the film feel like a smartly constructed puzzle that's easy to follow.Also, the much hyped Trinity test sequence is one of the most thrilling and awe inspiring moments of the year. Using a delayed reaction to get as much tension out of the build up as humanly possible and the fact that it was done practically just makes it even more mind blowing.Ludwig Göransson's score is another huge win. It manages to be so many things at once without breaking. Both modern and old fashioned, sweeping and triumphant yet also unnerving. It ratchets up the tension beautifully and confirms he's a perfect fit for Nolan's films.","

Oppenheimer," Theory only gets you so far...
",joberthefboom,04-Dec-23,"With the recent releases of 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie', a new cultural phenomenon seems to have taken place that will help define the mainstream cinema of this decade. It is interesting to note how both films enhanced the other to solidify themselves as modern classics, if not for their craftmanship alone, then because of the hype that surrounded them. Christopher Nolan's latest, especially, is a testament to his greatness as a filmmaker. His previous movies, while always entertaining, have a tendency of pretentiousness, of wanting to be something they aren't really. 'Oppenheimer' works so well because the story is grounded in history, and Nolan uses this snapshot of time to get to the bigger ideas he always intended to show, making this the best film yet, of his already illustrious career.As usual for Nolan, time plays an important role in 'Oppenheimer'. The film itself can be reduced to three parts, each lasting an hour, in which the character is introduced to the audience, in which we see him build the invention he became known for, and how he needs to come to terms with the consequences of his creation. All this is being told through Nolan's signature style of structural experimentation. The life of Oppenheimer, and his accomplishments, is being contrasted with the senate hearing of the film's secondary antagonist, Lewis Strauss, and the interrogation of Oppenheimer's loyalty to the United States of America. Despite being incredibly dense and full of information, the three-hour running time goes by surprisingly quickly. This can be attributed to the way in which Nolan manages the time, never telling us more than we should know at that particular moment in the film, and thus keeping the suspense throughout.Another key mention in achieving this accomplishment is reserved for editor Jennifer Lame. Because there is so much of the story to tell, and much of the film is men talking in rooms, it is quite the task to make all of it engaging for the audience. She manages to do just that, with very quick and hard cuts, giving the feel of an action movie, which is needed for the film to succeed. Especially in the first hour, where the speed of the shots and the rhythm behind them, help visualize Oppenheimer's immense gifts. How he saw visions of the underlying reality that physics tries to expose. How he learned to look at the world differently, communicated to us through the art of Pablo Picasso.Despite it being a biopic, the film doesn't think too highly of its protagonist, even though it states his world-altering importance. The character Oppenheimer is used as a portal for showing how ambition and arrogance can corrupt even the greatest of minds. Oppenheimer would have been a weak man, were it not for his incredible intellect. A man capable of moral thought, but not guided by it. Only through reflection on his decisions does he arrive at any form of morality, but always does so too late. Unable to commit to anything truthfully, driven only by his ego and his impulses. Lusting after women he cannot have and failing to take a firm stance on his politics, in spite of his clear sympathies for communist ideologies. Someone of obvious substance, but no conviction, making him both particle and wave. When our main character is introduced to Niels Bohr in the beginning of the film, Bohr asks what the J in J. Robert Oppenheimer stands for, ""nothing, apparently'' his tutor quips. A cheeky way of translating the spine-lessness of the man we would follow around for three full hours. This is the story of someone incapable to decide on his direction, and unable to face the consequences of his actions, despite his evident genius. Theory, really does, only get you so far.But then again, what would happen if you stole fire from the Gods and gifted them to mankind? If you became Prometheus, but also opened Pandora's box? If you were Adam and Eve and the snake that made them sin in the Garden of Eden? Would such a burden not be too heavy to bear for us mere mortals? Would your act, and the effects that follow it, not appear larger than anything you could ever be? His creation of divine power would end up breaking him, but his arrogance and curiosity would not allow him otherwise. A victim of his own potential, with the only chance of redemption being martyrdom. A mythmaking that is eventually granted to him by Lewis Strauss, someone who shares a lot of similarities with Oppenheimer himself, and someone who would commit the same mistakes he did. Two entitled men, desperate to write history for themselves, only to get humbled by the very thing they helped create, all because they could not keep their pride and ambitions under control.","

In a sideline to the story several hundreds of thousands of civilians get killed by the bomb Oppie developed, which costs him (Oppie) at least a few nights of good sleep, earning him the title of crybaby by Harry S.

",DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,22-Jul-23,"It Just Didn't Live up to the Hype, it's Not Good Enough.Quick Sidenote 1 - Who Else Noticed Cillain Murphys' Face in the Underground Place, when he Looked at that Guy and Cillain Murphys' Cheekbones and Crazed EYES Were Disturbing as Hell? Was Cillian Murphy Really the Grim Reaper? 💀Quick Sidenote 2 - Apart from People who Love Movies Shot on Film and the ""Nolan can't do a Thing Wrong and even when he does we won't acknowledge it Crowd"". General Audiences won't Get into this Film (From my Observation of Todays IMAX Viewing), it's not that the General Audiences are Dumb (Some are though). It's Christopher Nolan and his (Lately anyway) inability to Convey the Plotline with as Least Noise (Confusion not actual Sound) as Possible.Here's how to Immensely Improve the Film -1. It's Too Long and Convoluted, Roughly Around When Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's when they should Of Started the Film, 10-15 Minutes of Backstory and then Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's the Correct Decision For the Film.2. Stop Constantly Cutting Back and Forth to Different Timelines, you can do it but not Constantly. It Breaks Immersion.3. The Sub-Plotline between Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy was Pointless (For what I would have done within the Story). Get rid of it.4. The Family Drama Between Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt was more Snore and More Bore. Get rid of it.5. The Film is Over Scored (Although the Score is Magnificent), because of this, the Score is Less and Less Effective as Time Goes on. Dial it Back on Score.6. Focus more on the Team Building the Atom Bomb, with them going back and forth with eachother, internal struggles about the project, uncertainty about the project etc.7. This Particular Film is Too Long for the Material Presented. Cut 30 to 40 Minutes out of the Film.8. The Atomic Explosion, yh not Good Enough. When a Large part of your Marketing is seeing an Atom Bomb going Off in IMAX, you better Deliver. It half Delivered. It needed that Gigantic Mushroom Cloud and an Astonishing Shot. Sigh 😔, there's no Astonishing Shot. The Sound After was Good Though.9. Instead of that Political Court Drama, The Film should of ended like this. After the Trinity Test, the Film needed to Ratchet-Up things Further by Dropping Fatman and Little Boy on Japan and to see 2 More Gigantic Mushroom Clouds in IMAX Ratio with Different Shots, Both Aerial and Ground Shots.Build Up to that, not a damn court room Drama, get that Tension going and Oppenheimer Massively unsure about what is about to happen And Finally End it with a Portrait Shot of Cillian Murphy (Whilst the Spectacular Score Booms) in Dismay about what he had Created. I don't want to hear about it on a Radio 📻😔.This Actual Film -1. The IMAX aspect Ratio Cinematography was Ok, some Beautiful Shots.2. The Performances Across the Board Were Strong.3. The Score is Spectacular but there's too much Score which Detracts from its effectiveness as time goes on.4. The Scenes between the Team of Scientists Going back and Forth with eachother over theory and Predictions were Great to See.5. The Tension and Build up Towards and During the Trinity Test were Really Strong.If I could Phrase the Oppenheimer film in one Phrase, it would be -""It did well enough here and it did well enough there but that's not Good Enough""","

Oppenheimer," Captivating Drama with strong performances
",soham-21358,21-Jul-23,"The captivating drama was carried away by supremely talented actors, with Cilian Murphy skillfully portraying the complex character of J. Robert Oppenheimer. After a long hiatus, RDJ (Acting POV) finally gets the recognition he deserves. The background music (BGM) is extraordinary, and the cinematography is exhilarating. Although I haven't read Kai Bird's ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" yet, I have watched NBC's latest documentary titled ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb,"" which is more convenient to grasp as a whole. However, Nolan's portrayal of Oppenheimer was superior from an subjective point of view.","

Oppenheimer," Movie of the year 2023
",ChuckleCritic,03-Dec-23,"Overall I feel it's been a fantastic year for cinema with several blockbusters coming out from some of our old favourites Nolan, Scorsese and Scott.I had seen this film over the Summer through the madness that was Barbieheimer, on July 21st. This comes out superior and quite frankly won't be topped this year and will be remembered as the best picture of 2023.Fantastic screen writing, unbelievable acting and overall cinema as we patiently wait for the inevitable scene of the bomb. The music in this made the way for setting some incredible scenes and really added to the whole flavour of the film.This is one of Nolans greats and Cillian is on his way to glory with this iconic performance of Mr. Oppenheimer!","

Oppenheimer," The single greatest accomplishment of Hollywood in the last 5 years
",grandempire1738,21-Jul-23,"It is fitting that a film about a person as consequential as Oppenheimer ended up being crafted by one of the most visionary directors of our time. Oppenheimer is a victory for filmmaking, a tour de force of incredible visuals, breathtaking cinematography and a sweeping scope that makes this narrative so illuminating. Every single aspect of this film blends into a seamless, awe inspiring experience where despite its gargantuan runtime, we are transfixed to a portrait of a man who's legend will forever be written in history. Brought alive by a phenomenon Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is the single greatest argument that movies and the theatrical experience still can mean something. If you watch this, definitely watch in 70mm IMAX - it's so worth it.Nolan has done what Hollywood desperately needed - make a coherent argument that filmmaking deserves a place in the pantheon of twenty first century art.","

Oppenheimer," Marvellous and will win all the Oscars, but a challenging watch
",namob-43673,21-Jul-23,"As expected this is a fantastic movie. Oppenheimer contain some of the best acting ever seen and the directing is simply amazing. The music score is stunning, the story brilliantly told, and there are barely any flaws. This is intelligent filmmaking of the highest order and come Oscar season this will win all but a few of those statues.With that said I am still only giving this a 8/10 and I have two very good reasons for it.The first reason I think many will agree with me on and that is the length of the movie and the dragged out scenes, dragged out storytelling. This is one of the few rare cases were a studio executive should have put is fot down, but instead Nolan was likely given free range. The movie clocks in at 3 hours, and you do feel those hours because although this is one of most brilliant movies of our time, there is also almost nothing going on. There is talking, reading of paper, brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. Only occasionally interrupted by a sex scene or a political discussion whether communism or fascism is the worst ideology. With the exception of the first atomic bomb explosion scene, which is beyond amazing, beyond brilliant, but except that scene what I mention above is the movie. That is it.Yes, the character study of Oppenheimer is in the center and as such this is one of the best ever made, but his career and life is portrait by reading of paper, a brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. This is a movie you can watch one time for the novelty, twice for its brilliance, but after that never again because it will simply get boring.The second reason this movie is not perfect is the background- and side characters. Emily Blunt's acting is almost bad, or her character is badly written, perhaps both? And Florence Pugh? Seriously? The ""council"" gentlemen and the other students, and almost everyone not having a prominent role, are all so much worse than the main cast that it shows. Murphy, Matt and Robert are all fantastic and put in the performance of their lives and as long as the focus are on them, what they do, say etc. This might be the best movie ever made. But as soon as someone else come into the picture the quality immediately sink to almost mediocre level.With those negatives out of the way I need to mention the Atomic bomb explosion scene again. That scene is heart stopping, the entire movie theatre went so silent and the awe moment is absolute classic, stunning. Filmmaking at its best.A 8/10 and I highly recommend. If you can overlook the not so great actors, and you do not mind the dragged out runtime you are likely to think this is the best movie ever made. It is not, but it is the top contender of the year for sure. At least until The Marvels show up.","

Oppenheimer," ""But I can run the Manhattan Project.""
",classicsoncall,28-Jul-23,"Filmmaker Paul Schreder has called ""Oppenheimer"" the ""best, most important film of this century"". Hyperbole aside, we're only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that's very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind. That could have occurred on July 16, 1945 with the testing of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, even Oppenheimer wasn't fully convinced of Edward Teller's (Benny Safdie) 'near zero' proclamation that all would be well.I must confess, I don't know a whole lot about the development of the A-Bomb, but the movie has steered me in the direction of learning more. What I didn't expect in the latter third of the film was how the railroad job the Gray Board, influenced by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), tried to demonize Oppenheimer for his early Communist sympathies, while questioning his loyalty to the United States. With eighteen years gone by and Oppenheimer's loyalty capably demonstrated, his treatment at the board smacked of personal animus for which Strauss eventually paid a price with his failure to be approved for a Cabinet position. That little tidbit about a future President casting a negative vote was a great bit of trivia I'll be anxious to research.Questions of best or most important movie aside, I think this is a valuable film for anyone to view keeping a historical perspective and how it translates to the modern era. With the threat of nuclear annihilation ever present, it's important for cooler heads to prevail on the world stage to prevent the kind of catastrophe that would emerge from the quixotic impulse of some madman. See the film.","

Oppenheimer," Deafening Sound effects ruine the film
",vanbertslagt,04-Oct-23,"Oppenheimer.The concept in really capturing the viewers, the audience, was largely undone by the constant and overwhelming sound effects throughout all of the scenes. The deafening booming bass tones hindered the concentration on the many dialogues, often hardly to distinguish.Also preventing a subtile building up towards a climax at the first atomic bomb test, which should have been the ultimate sound effect.How could the sound effect department lead by Richard King, sound designer and supervisor sound editor allow this to happen? Nor has Director Christopher Nolan taken measures to balance and integrate the sound effects in a more subtle way.Apart from this I was really impressed by the acting skills of many of the cast, naturally by the main actors Cillian Murphy, my favorite from Peaky Blinders, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.The complexity of the script and the many dialogues made it vital to keep concentrated on the frequently alternating scenes of past and present.All over the intriguing subject of the development towards the use of the first atomic bomb, the interaction between scientists and politicians in one of the most turbulent times in human history make it a worthwhile film to go and see.Hopefully the effects of such destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki make present and future use of these weapons of mass destruction not a real matter choice in times of war.I am thankful I was able to visit Japan and Hiroshima in real life.This film by Christopher Nolan, the acting of a great cast and the role of Oppenheimer in history make us aware of the precious existence of Mother Earth and humanity.","

Oppenheimer," Some of Nolan's best work yet
",inovski,04-Dec-23,"I've watched almost all of Christopher Nolan's movies, yet only the Dark Knight tops Oppenheimer.I had put this movie into my watchlist backlog ever since it came out and always thought that it would be a boring cliche movie that I wouldn't be able to sit 3 hours through. Well I was wrong.The movie's strongest sides are the storytelling, acting, score and cinematography. I really cannot think of a negative aspect to associate with it, even though many people suggest the movie is too long, I personally fully disagree.3 hours sounded like a chore yet I didn't move a single muscle once I started the movie, it was phenomenal from beginning to end.Storytelling - Very well paced, every character felt well explained and each story had just the right amount of screen time to deliver the emotions that the director wanted to give to the audience.Acting - Top tier acting largely down to the amazing casting choice for the movie. Each actor made an outstanding performance, but I must especially mention Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy's phenomenal performance, they are some of the greatest actors of our generation.The Score - I cannot put into words how mouthwatering the music was in Oppenheimer.The music was always so loud yet it fit so well with every situation. I felt genuine concern and tension solely because of the music, the best I can explain it is that you could always hear it yet never fully notice it.Cinematography - No words needed, it's an aesthetic beauty. But this is well known for Nolan movies so is anyone truly surprised?All in all it is subjectively my favorite Nolan movie and I could watch it again tomorrow without thinking twice.Must watch!","

Oppenheimer," I had low expectations going in..
",kurt2439,20-Aug-23,"Sadly it couldn't even meet them. I thought this would at least be a good telling of historical drama but as in Tenet, Nolan seems to have lost the ability to actually tell a meaningful story and cares more about his latest ideas for cinematic style than his need to actually build emotion. The movie does conclude powerfully but cheaply, in literally the last 10 seconds, but I can't forgive it for wasting 30 minutes of my life before that. I thought the movie was 3 star entertainment, an IMDB 6.7 until somewhere around that 2 hour 30 mark when I actually checked my watch -- something I haven't done in any movie whatsoever -- in who knows how long. Why was this 3 hours long? Why was this offered in IMAX? Not only wasting 30-45 minutes more than necessary but more of my money as well. And why does one of the most powerful directors of my time need to rely on inserting 10 seconds of doom to create an impression at the end of his movie instead of actually building a story with a meaningful plot (to the movie, not to history). I'm hopeful the director of some of the greatest Hollywood movies of the last 20 years will strike gold again, but I won't trust him with my cinema dollars again.","

Oppenheimer," A highly overrated film with an obnoxiously loud soundtrack
",karimnn,13-Aug-23,"I had high hopes for this film.Starting with the cast, Matt Damon, whom I really admire, however this isn't a film for his type of acting, his trademark smirk cannot be hidden unfortunately. Robert Downey Jr is unsurprisingly amazing in this film, this actor is so flexible he can star in any film. Cillian Murphy is also a great actor and did an amazing job portraying Oppenheimer's conflict within himself.Sometimes silence is more powerful than loudness.The film is drowned by the soundtrack, at times I couldn't hear the dialogue, ok I get it that is the point in some scenes, but when this drags on for about 3 hours, it gets old and boring.The bomb explosion was weak, yes weak. Nolan's didn't want to use CGI, well sorry Chris but without CGI there is no way in hell you would be able to simulate or emulate a nuclear explosion. The sound of the explosion was not powerful due to the rest of the film being so loud, the explosion did not have a single element of surprise or awe. The screen filled with fire was OK but again, since the rest of the film was so loud, there was no awe.This film should have been a 2 hours and 15 minutes, not 3 hours of continuous political dialogues.There is a great series about Oppenheimer and the bomb on a streaming service, that is much more watchable.","

With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me.","

Oppenheimer," Absorbing, Extremely Well-Acted, and a Fascinating Subject
",don2507,30-Jul-23,"It's gratifying to know that in a supposedly ""dumbed down"" America, a three-hour docudrama about a theoretical physicist and his atomic ""project,"" along with a closed-door security clearance hearing and an open Senate confirmation hearing, both full of dialogue and minimal ""action,"" is generating a huge, but deservedly so, box office. I found this film mesmerizing as the three hours seem to fly by for me. It has a very intelligent script, some masterful acting, and a focus on a fascinating, if enigmatic, character, i.e., Oppenheimer. The ""father"" of the atomic bomb was, indeed, a genius and generous-minded (on occasion), but also exhibited character flaws, and for such an adept administrator was also politically naïve.The physicists behind the letter to FDR knew Germany had a head start in nuclear power (Germany under Otto Hahn was the first nation to split the atom), and it would have been a dangerous world indeed if Hitler had a monopoly on the atomic bomb, but those same physicists were reluctant to use it against Japan in the waning days of the Pacific War, and Oppenheimer shared some of their reservations. The subsequent guilt he felt was manifest in a great scene in the film where he meets with Truman and says he has blood on his hands. Truman barks to him: ""no you don't; you built it but I authorized its use."" Later in the film, where he's being humiliated at the security clearance hearing, his psychologically astute wife asks him why is he putting up with this in person....""you must need this humiliation as penance for your guilt.""Kudos to Nolan for not, at least explicitly, tying the use of the two bombs to Japan's surrender. In fact, except for one high level meeting where potential targets are discussed, there's almost zero real-time reference to Hiroshima, Nagasaki, or the battleship Missouri. It's almost folklore in U. S. history, but not elsewhere, that the two bombs were solely crucial in bringing about a surrender from a fanatical enemy, but although most of us Americans don't want to believe this, Soviet entry into the war against Japan (at our behest; see Yalta) was probably more crucial. The 5-year Soviet-Japan Neutrality Pact offered some hope to Japan's War Cabinet that a negotiated settlement could moderately soften the blow of unconditional surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria that hope was irretrievably gone and the Japanese leadership was shocked. There are more references to Soviet entry into the war in the minutes of the War Cabinet than the the atomic bombs which were indeed appalling to the leadership. The Soviets invaded the Kuril Islands and had plans, if the war continued, of invading Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido. The War Cabinet wanted no parts of a Soviet, even if shared, occupation of any of the home islands.Another historical issue is prompted by the film, and that is the veiled depiction that the physicists who were Jewish seemed more interested (if necessary) in using the bomb against Nazi Germany (who could blame them as emigres) but very reluctant to use it against Japan in the closing days. There's one pre-war scene where Oppenheimer meets Heisenberg in Germany, and as depicted, it's a fairly amiable meeting. Heisenberg's WW II impact is interesting. He apparently led the German nuclear effort which was subsequently found to be not very far along. Why, with the head start they had? Some explanations: (1) Speer did not allocate sufficient financial resources, (2) a negative opinion on Heisenberg is that he tried hard but made lots of mistakes, (3) a positive opinion on Heisenberg is that he purposely sabotaged the Nazi effort, and (4) theoretical physics in Nazi Germany was referred to as Jewish physics.","

Oppenheimer," While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best works in history.
",iamianiman,20-Jul-23,"Christopher Nolan, whose previous works use time and space as his playground, did it once again with this based on a true story film, something that we didn't expect. His way of storytelling proves that he's the greatest directors to ever live on the planet, mastering in building up the story all the while keeping the audience engaged by elevating its suspense, scope, atmosphere and music tempos, creating a masterpiece ouevre.Oppenheimer is a visceral experience. It is able to create and provoke tension and anxiety in their audience. Rarely do we ever get this type of films offering this kind of experience but Nolan did it, just like Interstellar or Inception. It is haunting. It is moving. It is evocative. It knows what it tries to deliver and it does so well in eliciting these emotions as you sit and witness through it all.Out of the 2 dozens of famous actors in this film, we have to give special shout outs to 4 of them namely Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. & Jason Clarke. Cillian Murphy is able to tell Oppenheimer's story largely from the looks and expressions of his face, a true work of art. His face just tells everything, like a grandeur painting that moves accordingly to the beat of the story and emotions. Emily Blunt as Mrs Oppenheimer is just impeccable. Her performance is so good, there was once scene that made us cried a bit. That 'it' scene that will appear on the screen as her name is called as one of the nominees for Best Supporting Actress and hell yes, we have high hope she will win next year's Academy Awards for this! Downey and Clarke are both impressive as well, 2 characters that are very good at spoken dialogues and they really did their homework to study the characters very well.We are truly in love with the dialogues. It is rich with contexts and it feels very densed. We just love the fact that the speed and pacing of the dialogues are almost similar to Aaron Sorkin's materials who directed The Social Network and Molly's Game. Dialogues are spoken incessantly, word after word, without putting a full stop for audience to breathe. And these dialogues really enrich and enhance the film's build-up, settings and mood that elevate the whole immersive experience.These dialogues, most of them, are necessary for the story and character developments. What are or have been said are the building blocks of both these elements, that by the end, they blossom themselves into something poetically but shatteringly beautiful; acknowledging of the broken humans living in a broken world, that these non-fiction characters are far from perfect, just like the rest of us.However, the dialogues may not be easily digestible for general audiences. If you're into science and history, you are at an advantage. If not, then these jargons and sometimes, poetic style dialogues would make your head spin. They are not friendly. Even when they did explain on quantum physics, it wasn't something that can be understood by everyone. We love the dialogues but to be safe, prepare a cup of coffee prior because this is one brain exercise film, the good kind, of course.If you're a Nolan fan, you'd know that plot twists are something he has in store for us. But did this biopic has one? Did Nolan take that risk? The risk that might jeopardize the authenticity of the story? Without revealing, we can say that the third act is very, very good. Something that most directors attempted but failed. However, Nolan did it naturally, the story unfolds excellently even with all the complexity that surrounds it. He did it smooth. Strong emotions were evoked, he left us something to ponder about. The experience was quite traumatic and he brought us along the journey to experience what it's like to be Oppenheimer. It is that good.This film is morally complex. It questions whether it's right or wrong. It questions whose side we are on. It delves deep and studies Mr. Oppenheimer and brings it along with us for the ride. Nolan was able to let us feel what he's feeling as if we're stepping in his shoes. Thought-provoking. Mind-wandering. Psychologists will have a great time in cinemas.A brilliant choice, Oppenheimer used both black-and-white and colour as it conveys different meanings with the former staying true to the real event that had happened in history with (mostly) exact dialogues, body language and circumstances powerfully acted mostly by Robert Downey and Alden Ehrenreich. The latter is used, to maximize its entertainment value while still maintains the actual events recorded in history. Not once we felt annoyed by the transition, it went well.Targeted for mass market, we felt this could have cut about 20-30 minutes short so that all audiences can enjoy. Although there was very little to none unnecessary scenes, we still strongly believe that Nolan could take out a few scenes. If this happened, the momentum and pacing would better for everyone. Also, the Trinity Test was purely excellent. The practical effects and sound designs were really executed well. The music score, composed by Ludwig Goransson, though not as masterpiece as Hans Zimmer, is breathtaking. It felt right with all the scenes, it elevates out immersive experience, it left us at the edge of our seats.Verdict: Hauntingly beautiful, Oppenheimer feels like a ticking time bomb as it evokes a strong visceral and immersive experience. Almost everything is done right, Christopher Nolan makes sure this film blows us away with a rich story, stark character studies, strong dialogues, powerful music score, impeccable acting amongst many others. While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best ouevre in history.","

Oppenheimer," Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.
",rayanenaffati,19-Jul-23,"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman.","

Still, when the cinemas a full of superheroes and boring safe IPs, I hate criticizing a film for being too intelligent and wanting to tackle important societal and philosophical topics. I did watch this film and BARBIE in the theater over the summer, so I did get the Barbenheimer experience. Both films contain important and timely messages for audiences, and although OPPENHEIMER is the better film, BARBIE is more accessible to a wider audience, but neither film feels preachy and neither forget to keep the audience entertained and engaged. Overall, it's a terrific film that demands to be seen on the big screen and will lose much watching it at home on a TV. Watch this one in a theater if you can!","

You can witness his growth as a director and the growing influence of production companies he's working for. His best movie is still Following (1998) which contained really long still shots with absolutely no soundtrack at all. Slowly, he or his bosses fell in love with Hans Zimmer and similar composers over the years - so much that there's never ever a 'quiet' scene in his movies anymore.Talking about the editing techniques, with the help of cuts, he was able to show three different timelines in Following (1998). He went a bit overboard with this style in Memento (2000) and now it's reached the stage that it literally can cause headaches.Oppenheimer (2023) was, sadly, an over-the-top blend of non-stop overly loud soundtrack and hundreds of cuts with a speculative approach towards the character and his emotions. There were so many unnecessary cuts that it felt impossible to care about any character. These ""parallel"" scenes were needed in Memento, Inception or maybe some of his other movies but why would you need to do something like this again in a biopic? Why was there a need of epic soundtrack when two characters were, for example, having a trivial conversation?A few impressive things about the movie included strong acting performances from some really big names (but I couldn't care about any character just because scenes kept cutting for no reason) and an incredibly well crafted nuclear explosion scene with delayed sound effects - this was probably the closest thing to reality.This movie could have been so much better if it weren't for the forced cheap tricks which, I'm beginning to think, he's very afraid to deviate from. No one talks about Following (1998) anymore and he probably understands that. He is stuck in his comfort zone and he won't ever get out of it. I recently found out that he's a fan of Terrence Malick which makes a lot of sense now. However, when Terrence Malick adopts this style, it works. That's the difference.I couldn't like the movie. I tried. I really tried.5.5/10.","

Oppenheimer," Disappointed
",kppk-04802,24-Jul-23,"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end.","

Oppenheimer," It's clever but it also has a heart
",julioramosest,21-Jul-23,"Nolan strangely moves from petentious films, bad ones right away after you take the glitter away, to straight ahead masterworks of movie making. He seams to go 1 good 1 bad each time. Now it was time for a good one after the pretentious, sloppy Tenet. And boy did he deliver. This is a wonderful, challenging, unapologetic, very brave in some political way piece of movie making. Well acted all along, well written, large in scope but fully accomplishing. But it's what lies underneath what I love the most. I'm totally in love with the political subplots: younger generations need to be reminded not only about the dangers of the bomb, but for the equally killing Macarthysms. Call it how you want it, the blind, stupid far righters are a danger to the world.","

Oppenheimer," Film of the year: A biopic like no other
",nolle1,03-Dec-23,"Christopher Nolan's latest film, a three-hour biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brains behind the atomic bomb, easily takes the crown for the best film of 2023. Every aspect of the film especially from the camera work to the storytelling, Cinematography, original score, and editing, is top-notch.It stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist credited with being the ""father of the atomic bomb"" for his role in the Manhattan Project-the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. The film also stars Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife ""Kitty"", Matt Damon as head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. As U. S. Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's communist lover Jean Tatlock. The ensemble supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman and Kenneth Branagh.Nolan's trademark non-linear storytelling shines through in Oppenheimer's narrative, giving the biopic a unique touch. Unlike typical biographies, we don't get to see Oppenheimer's childhood or growth years. Instead, the film zeroes in on the interesting parts of his life, especially when he was making waves in the world of physicists and the tension brought to the world by Oppenheimer and the Los Alamos team during the development of the atomic bomb which is portrayed with gripping intensity.My favourite scene from the film, which fits perfectly, is the well acted scene between President Harry S. Truman (played by the great Gary Oldman) and Oppenheimer in the White House, marking a turning point in the film. Here the film takes a deep breath and break from the intense scenes of the trinity tests and the shortly the aftermath of dropping the bomb. This scene includes dark humour with quotes such as ""Don't let that crybaby back in here"" and Trumans response to Oppenheimer telling him ""I feel that I have blood on my hands"", based on the real meeting between the two.As mentioned before, Oppenheimer is really well done. Everything, from the camera work, music, cinematography, editing and more, is top-notch. The film is a masterpiece, and there's not much to criticize. Maybe some of the first scenes with Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock felt a bit awkward without any real passion, but apart from that, it's all goodRating: 9.5/10.","

Oppenheimer," Astounding - and not for any special effects
",richard-1787,23-Jul-23,"This is one of the most intriguing and astounding movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in my over 60 years of movie going. Yes, there are some impressive special effects, but they are truly the least impressive things here.First is the script. A GREAT deal of history is condensed into three hours of often quickly delivered dialogue. It is succinct, and it is often brilliantly structured. Flashbacks, flashforwards, jump cuts, etc. Not to impress, as was too often the case in Dunkirk, but to create an ever richer tapestry of historical events and tie them together. Definitely deserves an Oscar.Second is the directing. Getting all of this to flow, and often rush forward in an intelligent and cohesive way was an act, or many acts, of directorial genius. Nolan was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for Dunkirk, but didn't win. This time he should definitely win. His work bringing all this together is phenominal.The acting is all fine to very fine. It should definitely make a star out of Cillian Murphy, whom I had never heard of before but who does a fine job as Oppenheimer. Damon is good as Groves, though I suspect some of his dialogue was ""enhanced"" to make the character more interesting. I read Groves' book on the Manhattan project. He didn't come off as that blunt and forceful.The editing is also remarkable. I was especially impressed with some of the sound choices at crucial moments, such as the explosion of the test bomb. It keeps you on your toes and makes you think because it delivers the unexpected.This movie is 3 hours long. I was not bored for a single minute.My hat is off to Nolan. This is truly a work of genius.","

Oppenheimer," If this isn't a masterpiece, I don't know what else is.
",Achyut_Prashast_Singh,01-Aug-23,"Oppenheimer is a rare biopic which, in spite of being driven entirely by dialogue and character drama, never bored me at any point. I was so amazed by the film that even after many a times not understanding the scientific stuff and all, I was glued to the screen, understanding it through the characters and their actions alone. I loved every bit of it and was totally focused. Once it was over, I walked out with a sense of satisfaction.Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece which he has painted with the help of talented actors such as Cillian Murphy who has sunken his teeth into the portrayal of the protagonist. He dominates every scene he is in, and I'm hoping he definitely gets an Oscar nod next year. If not him, then at least Robert Downey Jr. Deserves one for sure. His electrifying performance is so good you won't even think about seeing an old Tony Stark at all. Similarly terrific are Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh who leave the desired impact.The first half focuses on the character more than the main explosion which is later showcased in one of the most ingenious and cinematically remarkable ways. That means I should also warn you to not come merely for the explosion. This is a heavy dialogue-driven drama with little bit of action and almost no violence. A thriller feel is maintained throughout with the help of the background score, and that makes many scenes more intriguing to watch. I personally felt the human drama of Oppenheimer was more appealing than the explosion itself, because that is what this film is actually about: his life before and after the nuclear test. The film also excels in the technical departments; the sound editing is truly remarkable, and will make you hold your breath multiple times.I must say Oppenheimer turned out to be even better than what I had imagined. It was nowhere boring to be fair, and that's rare for a movie which is so long and driven entirely by conversations. Those who blindly follow the hype and go for fun are bound to be disappointed because this biographical & political courtroom drama has neither the set pieces nor the sci-fi of Nolan's previous movies. It is the kind of film which gets better with subsequent viewings. I'm just glad it made me return to the big screen after months and delivered what I paid for. The only sad part is, there's no IMAX near me, otherwise I'd have gone a second time too.","

Oppenheimer," It's the bomb
",alexburrow-43430,04-Dec-23,"I love the fact how this move deals with the internal struggles of Robert Oppenheimer. It really shows how knowledge can be used as a weapon of mass destruction. I also like the twist at the end when Robert Downey, Jr.'s character betrayed Oppenheimer. The visuals in this movie are stunning. I think this movie has a good tone and pace. The slow talking parts are balanced out with drama and I like that that it's not just boring but you also feel like somethings is getting done every single time someone's talking in it and it really moves the plot forward. The one negative about this movie would be that I feel like it drags on a bit towards it. I recommend this movie to people who love history.","

Oppenheimer," Mixed bag, and yes, I was bored
",FixedYourEnding,24-Jul-23,"Was looking forward to seeing this movie on the big screen. Big fan of Nolan's previous movies and I usually like political and historical drama. On one side giving this movie anything less than '7' is hard, due to spectacular technical creation and a wonderful story told, but also I would argue that this movie does not deliver enough for its 3 hours length, in terms of interest and emotional attachment for the audience.I think most people will agree on what makes this movie a great Hollywood production, intense story and great level of realism, however here is a list of things that I didn't like:1. Unlike popular opinion, I did not like the casting. The actor list is full with big names, but many of them could have been better casted, in particular I did not like the cast of Matt Damon (as Leslie Groves, the army general) and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Even more unpopular, I think R. Downey Jr. Is also a bad cast and I kept seeing Iron Man instead of the character he was playing.2. It's quite boring. By at large the movie is pretty uneventful, there are pretty much 3 events - 1 is a surreal sex scene, 2 is the blow-up experiment, and 3 is the aftermath ""trial"". By the 3rd hour I saw people starting to check their phones in the theater. I usually get very upset of people that check the phone during the movie, but in this case I could totally relate with them.3. Failure to create emotion. I'm not sure what it is, but something really kept me from identifying with any of the characters. It is almost like the actors were too good for the role they are given in the movie, so a little tie-in with my complaint on the casting, or it could be the strong left-wing vibes in the movie, but the bottom-line is that you are not really feeling the pain of any of the characters.So, it's a '7', probably will win an Oscar or two. It is an important historical story but it felt too much like a history lesson then an entertainment piece, so overall disappointing for me as a big-screen experience and a Nolan fan.","

So I can say the movie is one of the best biographic movies of all time. Second, every historical people that effected this process found a place themselves in this movie. This is also okay.Details are perfect, music is good, actors and actresses are magnificent. Everything is perfect about Oppenheimer. I'm goong to say 3 Oscars at least.","

Oppenheimer," Just not good.
",HypnoticPoison7,26-Jul-23,"I'm a huge Nolan fan since his first film. My favorite is still Memento, which is thorough and slow and very dialogue heavy as well as philosophical. I have a friend who works in Los Alamos as a chemical engineer and have visited the area as well as heard plenty about Oppenheimer and the way he changed the world. The importance of scientists and especially theoretical physicists is not lost on me. Between all that and my love for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, I'd been looking forward to this movie for a long time.That said, my entire group was disappointed with this movie, starting with the run time. I ask you, how is it possible that a three hour movie can feel rushed?! Somehow Nolan managed it. The first hour of the film feels so fast, disjointed and erratic that it gives you anxiety. He breezes over the most important parts of Oppenheimer's life and elaborates more on scenes that never happened (such as the ones with Einstein). The movie should be about a great man with conflicting emotions and instead we get political tripe with entirely fictional material. The real Oppenheimer had such an interesting life and personality that there was no need to embellish or insert so much random nudity, politics and Matt Damon. I'm still wondering what Nolan's point was in making this film. Why not just make a documentary if you're going to make such a boring lackluster story? There's just nothing here to pull you in and we really paid close attention. Eric Weinstein should have been consulted so we could have had a better movie discussing the plight of actual scientists in this country and how they are treated by our government. Tell the story of how secrets are kept from the scientific community to protect governments rather than citizens in order to slow progress and divert attention elsewhere. Whatever Nolan's point was, it was lost somewhere in the three hours of cameos and more anti Russian propaganda.","

Oppenheimer," Nolan's most personal and best screenplay.
",sydmiller12,08-Dec-23,"Like the headline says this film had a lot of heart and it treats each character with care and Nolan writes them very well. I haven't been able to connect this much to a Nolan character since Interstellar.Another thing I have to praise is the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema is amazing as per usual he always delivers and this is no different.Nolan's direction is very thought out in terms of blocking and where he decides to place the character. And I think his direction goes very hand in hand with the writing. Also, another thing that goes hand in hand with the writing is the editing from Jennifer Lame who is an amazing editor, and I think this is some of her best work.Every performance is amazing. And every actor delivers something interesting to each character. Some stand out performances are obviously Cillian Murphy & Florence Pugh. I never was really interested a Cillian fan but this definitely changed my mind, and I knew Florence was an amazing actress since I saw Midsommar, I would definitely check her out in A Good Person which was amazing as well.Overall great film!","

Oppenheimer," Overrated but solid
",smilingdiplomatist,16-Feb-24,"With Nolan directing and a cast of heavy weights like Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr et al - this film was always going to be great.As a novice in the history of Oppenheimer and his contributions to the nuclear bomb, I enjoyed how steeped in real-life (if dramatised) history throughout the film.While a lot of the events of Oppenehimer and supporting characters' lives have to be rushed in order to keep the story moving, I felt like the major story beats are covered throughout the first 2/3rds.Incredibly compelling themes and disguised and there's some great interplay between the characters with the dialogue.For me, Oppenheimer begins to fall flat in the final act, where a lot of the focus is on the trial and blink-and-you-miss-it moments from the previous 2 hours are suddenly pivotal to the plot. I felt like I started losing track of what was going on around this point. While I followed it enough to feel satisfied by the conclusion, it definitely came across feeling like the pacing lost its way during the mid-section of the film.Overall though, a great presentation of a significant historical period and played to perfection by the cast.","

Oppenheimer," You've never seen a film like Oppenheimer
",eddie_baggins,24-Jul-23,"It's taken me a few days to be able to sit down and write down my thoughts about Christoper Nolan's newest big screen epic, the other part of the now infamous ""Barbenheimer"" double bill that has been re-writing record books over there launch weekends, having had this time to ponder and contemplate I am confident in saying that I've never seen a film quite like this biopic and while it's a film with flaws and components that don't stick their respective landings, Nolan's film is nevertheless a powerful, poignant and technically marvellous piece of original film-making that further establishes the esteemed director as a generational talent whose skill set is unrivalled.It's incredible to think that a three hour dialogue heavy expose of a theoretical physicist and the creation of the worlds first atomic bomb could become a film that is being viewed on such a scale that Oppenheimer is currently playing too and while it's clearly been enhanced by the fact Nolan's heavy hitting drama has been partnered alongside the pink behemoth that's Barbie, there's also no denying that audiences are hungry for original content that gives them something more than just another run of the mill experience and that's exactly what Oppenheimer does.Told in a typical Nolan like fashion that refuses to play out in a manner that could said to be stereotypical, Oppenheimer operates in multiple timelines and requires audiences to pay close attention to who is who but despite covering immense ground and delving into far more than just Oppenheimer's past, present and future or the bomb he was responsible for bringing into existence, Nolan's film never becomes too complicated or overbearing as clever direction, editing and script work ensures that its three hour runtime will grip anyone willing to go along with it, creating an utterly engaging and even white knuckle experience that is the very definition of what cinema is all about.Lead by a long overdue and awards worthy turn from Cillian Murphy as the titular figure, who is ably supported by a string of A-listers that most notably includes key performances from the likes of Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's long-suffering wife Kitty, Matt Damon as military head honcho Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. In a scene stealing performance as Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer is all class on screen as Nolan juggles one of the most stacked ensemble casts of the modern era and while some of his big name performers might only get mere minutes of screentime, each and every one of them brings their A-game to what must surely be regarded as Nolan's most noteworthy feature yet based on performances.Outside of this aspect of Nolan's masterwork is the technical elements of this big budget affair that includes an unforgettable score by Ludwig Göransson, exemplary editing by Jennifer Lame, beautiful cinematography from the increasingly impressive Hoyte Van Hoytema and sound mixing/editing from Nolan's team that ensures despite the fact Oppenheimer is very much focused in on the people at the heart of the story, so much of the film still feels like a grand cinematic offering and there are moments within Nolan's opus that are likely to remain some of the most memorable cinematic moments of recent times, none more so than the breathtaking detonation test scene that left my particular screening as silent as a field mouse.I have no doubt that like many of Nolan's films in the past decade detractors and naysayers will turn their attention to singling out elements of Nolan's film that may be considered weak points and while there's going to be further debate about the sound mix of this film and Nolan's films as a whole, that at times have their dialogue drowned out by the score or other aspects of the mix or the debate that rages about Nolan's ability to connect on the human level, that is on show here with a strangely cold romantic element between Murphy and Blunt and also with Florence Pugh's Jean Tatlock (not due to performances, more so development) but allowing your gaze to be directed into these areas as a main point of focus is robbing one of the experience they could otherwise have.Building to a crescendo that is both surprising, haunting and unforgettable, it's unlikely that you will soon forget Oppenheimer, a beautifully staged biopic that is also so many other things all at once, where Oppenheimer ranks amongst all of Nolan's work will take some time to decide but what's undeniable is the fact Nolan has once more proved original film-making is alive and well, should one take the time and care to bring it too life.Final Say -A film that feels unlike any before it, Oppenheimer is a big screen epic that is both grand and intimate, thrilling and confronting and a further addition to the growing legacy of Christoper Nolan to be regarded as one of the most important voices in cinematic history.5 bowls of marbles out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

This was also the best performance by Emily Blunt I think ever. Matt Damon was fantastic, and Florence was too. Loved the small roles of 3 Academy Award winners with Affleck being terrifying with just a little screen time, Oldman being unrecognizable and Malek stealing the last 20 minutes of the film. Hoyte van Hoytema once again made fantastic cinematography one of his best and Ludwig Göransson ATE that score. I think it's one of the best scores in a film ever. Period!

Oppenheimer," Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie
",cinemapersonified,29-Jul-23,"Rating: 9.6
Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future).Brilliant Direction (The most mature storytelling Nolan has ever displayed as he weaves and controls all the scenes on both a macro and micro-scale to drive the story forward to show his message; this was the Nolan has ever done in getting the most out of his actors as the acting down the cast is amazing to where there are so many actors that have their best performance with this movie; has a more palatable interpretation of his signature Nolan style as he makes the audience think but in a way that they can understand (even if another viewing is needed to provide more clarity)), Incredible Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Cillian Murphy (A career-defining performance as he truly embodies the role of Oppenheimer and is the real lightning rod for other actors to work off of as his presence really drives the performance of others and moves the story forward), Great to Incredible from Emily Blunt (Plays her role very well as she portrays the trauma and troubled relationship she has with her husband very well, showing the weight of him being passed onto her as the movie goes on), Great from Matt Damon (Plays his role very well and works off of Cillian to help drive the development of the Manhattan Project forward, really acts as the moral bridge between the government and the scientists), Great to Incredible from Robert Downey Jr. (Plays a very multi-dimensional role very well as his polished performance shows the cunning nature politicians can have as they try to be two-faced), Great from Florence Pugh (Does a Great job with the short time she is given as her chemistry with Murphy shows the effort Jean's relationship had on Oppenheimer), Great from Josh Hartnett (My favorite performance out of the secondary cast as his charm really brings personality into the movie that is filled with monotonous scientists), Very Good from Casey Affleck (Given very little screentime but does a very good job in building tension between Murphy in his scenes), Very Good from Rami Malek (A key performance in the movie as he does so much with very little given as he really comes to play in the final moments of the movie), Very Good from Kenneth Branagh (Uses a lot of his experience to play this role as he does well in playing the Dane that has an impact on Oppenheimer's career), Good from Benny Safdie (Kinda the most inexperienced performance of the whole movie but he does a good job in holding his own and building a conflicting relationship with Oppenheimer), Very Good from Jason Clarke (Plays one of the true antagonists of the movie very well as he is a driving presence in the security hearings), Good to Very Good from David Krumholtz (The comedic presence of the movie as he does try to make jokes throughout the movie (the only issue is that the movie is moving so fast there is no time to let the jokes stay and marinate with the audience)), Very Good to Great from Tom Conti (Embodies Albert Einstein very well and it feels like he was perfectly cast as his chemistry with Murphy and his delivery helps show the relationship Oppenheimer had with Einstein), Very Good from Alden Ehrenreich (A surprisingly very good performance from a Nolan composite character as his performance is the real moral lense the audience has to look into the whole situation), Very Good from the rest of the cast (This is an understatement with how good the cast was there is no one bad performance in the entire cast, which is incredible given how deep it is)), Incredible Story (An incredibly dense story that crams many moments in Oppenheimer's life into the film, but uses pace and runtime to make it seem like it may be too short at points as all the story points connect and drive the narrative forward; it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the Manhattan Project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; The non-linear storytelling was an homage to Nolan's first break Memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the Manhattan Project), Brilliant Screenplay (One of the best screenplays I have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing I have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity), Incredible Score (Incredibly complements the movie well and is used very well to build emotion and create pace and tension throughout), Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography (The mix of IMAX cameras with large format 70 MM cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie), Great Sound (The sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous Nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear), Incredible Editing (The cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work I have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen), Incredible to Brilliant Visual Effects (Some of the best effects work I have ever seen as the use of practical effects over CGI show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology), Great Production Design (This is specifically for Los Alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town), Very Good Costumes (The costume work for Oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come), Plot Structure was very unique and non-linear as Nolan takes a page out of Memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and I am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the Manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and American community), Pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie), Climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture), Tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as Nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone, Saw in IMAX 70 MM and it really is an experience in itself.","

Oppenheimer," Overrated
",andrenollba,02-Sep-23,"The film failed to deliver on the hype. It is certainly Oscar-material, well produced and with great actors, but that doesn' t mean it was entertaining. The three hours were a bit too long, and, by the way,, what's so wrong with the traditional 2h-format, not many films deserve longer than that, and Oppenheimer is not one of them.. In my opinion too much footage was wasted on the congressional hearing and on the 'trial', which may be intresting for an American audience, but not so much for international viewers. The ethical dilemnas on building the bomb were justed hinted at, and that would have a more universal appeal.","

This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film.","

Oppenheimer," Not worth the extra money spent on IMAX
",alanvarghesester,27-Jul-23,"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers.","

Oppenheimer," Too long and too little to draw interest.
",ofjfhejs,25-Jul-23,"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher.","

Oppenheimer," Dude I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders
",marinamexias,12-Jan-24,"Oppenheimer was an amazing surprise! I wasn't super exited for the release of even for Oppenheimer at all, and honestly I get now why people were actually loving this movie.My only critic is that it's a very long movie, but I don't think there could be a shorten version of it so I guess I personally think it's a movie to be watched at home. For me of course, it's a movie of reflection and so you capture the message you need to watch at least for the first time in your time.I loved it , Cillian Murphy's acting is magnificent and no one else could capture the deep of the character besides him. He rocked!Everything about this movie is admirable and lovable. RDJ is amazing too and Emily blunt too. For some reason people were telling me that the movie was too much talking and no action and honestly when it comes to this I'm the first one to critic, but in this case it was honestly amazing the way they did it.They would be no other way to create tension and make us understand history in general without that conversations, so I highly disagree. And honestly, in the beginning, it feels a little uncomfortable because of all of the physics talking and I wasn't understanding anything so it was almost like I was watching Top Gun for the first time (lol my reference sucked) I need to get in this world and understand everything, so I would if you actually in there.Which brings me to the fact that they actually made me feel like the weight of the world was in my shoulders for a movie to make you feel this way it's got to be good. Christopher Nolan was on point, and the cinematography of the movie is magic. The whole metaphor with Prometeu and the fire was so on point, and I honestly had a lot of empathy for Robert.I loved Einstein in the movie. I felt like his connection with Oppenheimer was such a unique one and there were times that we could honestly feel what open Heimer was feeling and this was just an out of body experience for me.Sometimes I have a problem to connect to male characters, because I'm a female and experiences are different and in general sometimes I don't feel like watching a whole man movie. But this movie was something different in that story, probably because it's based on real life stuff, but it was honestly amazing.Cillian Murphy needs to be given an Oscar for this!!!! The make up to age him was pretty good too. Loved it! Too long though lol.","

In a time of madness for Nolan to have brought this to us now, we can be so thankful. Aimed squarely at our military industrial complex. The ""intelligence community"" which gives it the target this is a story that should be shown to every school kid.. young and old as aren't we all students and if we're not we're dead.I loved Oppenheimer. I watched it alone. Didn't want to have any interruptions. It was too short. I wanted more.All that has been said about this Film is correct and more. It stays with you. Rattles around your head. An epic achievement by all concerned. The main plaudits will go to Nolan and Murphy. Rightly so. As Robert Downey Jr said Cillian is in almost every scene. The technical mastery of the art shows Nolan at the very height of his profession. Both may look back and say ""it was worth the effort""

Oppenheimer," it's the world in which we now live
",lee_eisenberg,24-Jul-23,"Obviously a lot of the talk about Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" has involved its release the same day as Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Now that I've seen the former, all that I can say is that you must immediately drop everything and go see this movie, for it reminds you of the world in which we now live.Topping the cast is Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Born of humble beginnings, Oppenheimer became a renowned physicist and contributed to the development of nuclear weapons. However, his anti-nuclear activism - combined with his association with leftists in the '30s - drew the government's wrath in the post-war years. Murphy adopts a less-than-handsome look for the role, and looks increasingly disheveled as the movie progresses, showing Oppenheimer's feelings as the government went after him.Equally impressive is Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty. If you only know Blunt from her audience-pleasing roles (Into the Woods, Mary Poppins Returns, Jungle Cruise), then this will be a pleasant surprise. Kitty was not what we'd call an ""ideal"" wife. Indeed, she often came across as a lousy mother. Maybe part of this was because Robert spent so much time on her work, but she was not the world's most likable person. It was impressive to see Blunt play an abrasive character for a change.But most important is what the movie shows overall. A man who had no malice in his heart helped create the most destructive weapon in history. That, plus the mind-blowing scenes of the nuclear tests, make this almost a horror movie (personal horror, that is).All in all, you should see it if you get a chance. If nothing else, it should remind us of the danger of nuclear weapons. As I read somewhere, as long as they exist, there's the risk that they'll get used.The rest of the cast includes Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh.","

Oppenheimer," Nolan's best film to date.
",MOscarbradley,22-Jul-23,"Like Martin Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock before him Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. A film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. But what will his followers think of ""Oppenheimer""? Will today's movie-going generation even know who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening I attended I saw two people leave), and can Nolan do justice to his subject?To that last question the answer is undoubtedly yes. As I say Nolan is a film-maker of great skill and ""Oppenheimer"" is unquestionably his best film to date. It's an old-school epic, three hours long, superbly shot on the biggest of canvases and with an all-star cast even if some of those Oscar-winning actors are reduced to cameos, (Gary Oldman as a devious Harry Truman). At its centre there's a terrific performance from Irish actor Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, chosen perhaps for his slight resemblance to the man but also because Nolan clearly saw in Murphy talents other of his screen roles never fully explored.Of course, in typical Nolan fashion the narrative isn't linear. The film may begin with Oppenheimer the Cambridge student and end with Oppenheimer the decorated old man but in-between Nolan skips back and forth in time, shooting both in colour and in black and white and framing his film around two sets of 'hearings', one in which Oppenheimer, late in his career, appears before a committee of three to see if his security clearance will be renewed, knowing that this is nothing more than a kangaroo court; the other, filmed in black and white, the much larger senate committee hearings set up to determine the suitability of Lewis Strauss to be U. S. Secretary of Commerce in Eisenhower's government and in this role Robert Downey Jr. Not only give the best performance of his career but should be a shoo-in for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. These scenes form the backbone of the film and may prove too talkative for Nolan's customary audience. That said, this is a beautifully composed and highly intelligent picture, clearly aimed at an adult audience. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it sweeps the boards at next year's Oscars.","

",dfields-46972,17-Feb-24,"I almost turned this movie off after the first 30 minutes. I couldn't stay focused due to the choppy timelines going back and forth. It feels rushed but I think that's the point to give an air of intensity. Another reviewer mentioned the music being loud and overbearing and I agree! The music was also distracting and in some scenes totally unnecessary.I really felt lost during points of the movie, if you blink you'll miss something for sure. I don't plan on watching it again so I'll most likely watch a few documentaries about Oppenheimer to get more understanding of the man and his devastating work.","

",anibalcnso,06-Aug-23,"This film is a damn masterpiece. There are not enough words to propperly describe it and, at the same time, few sentences can truly explain how good this film is. And i can't say its flawless, but its ""flaws"" are so escarce and so minimum that the don't really matter.First thing I want to mention about this work of art is the acting performances. With a cast so stacked of stars, you would think some of them may not have the expected performances or even enough screen time (which I think is something that happened to Rami Malek, whose talent seemed a bit underappreciated): but it is the exact opposite. Everyone's performances are top tier, charismatic, powerful, memorable. It sounds too optimistic but they really are, but this is also due to the opportunities the film offers; it's almost three hours of intense, long, fast dialogues, in an exchange of politics, philosophy and physics terminology; and I have to be very honest here, this is not a story that can be missed even a bit. You may come after a brief bathroom break and find yourself lost in the plot. But it's all worth the attention. Its pace is perfect, and the three hours go by like nothing.Then we have, of course, the soundtrack and the photography, two aspects that are always perfectly taken care of in Nolan's films. So adecuate, so well prepared, you feel like every scene matters, you don't want to miss a single shot, a single sound.But what really surprised me and the thing I enjoyed the most is that the film talks about many other topics that are not shown in the trailer, so you come into it with an expectation and receive much more.With time, I'm sure it will be considered as a classic film, one of the best of 2020's decade, for shure.","

Oppenheimer," Chris Nolan continues his war against cinemagoers buttocks
",BlokeWithABrainUK,23-Jul-23,"This movie, about one of the most significant events in the history of humanity effectively boils the entire story down to a very drawn out HR meeting to decide whether J. Robert gets his security clearance revoked or not many years after the event.Er... who cares?I understand that Nolan chose to focus on the man rather than the event, but I think this was a mistake. Three hour biopics can work (rarely), but this is no Schindler's List. It is more a kitchen sink drama where the majority of the characters are one dimensional (Downey Junior gives it his best shot though as always), and the eponymous central character is not particularly compelling. He's interesting in a clinical kind of way but emotionally engaging, no. Despite a strong performance from Murphy, I simply didn't care much about the man.As a result of this focus there is little to be seen of the immense scientific endeavour of the Manhattan Project (the biggest ever at that point in history until the Apollo Programme), and there isn't much about the physics either. There could have been some real dramatic tension over the perceived race against the Nazis to develop an atomic weapon, but this is only referred to a couple of times in throwaway lines.Matt Damon is functional, and we get to learn that Robert himself was a bit of a serial shagger (that was a surprise), but again, so what? Oh, he did shag a lady who was a member of the communist party, so he might be tarred by the same brush. Or he might not. That is not a big enough tension to sustain a three hour movie.The Trinity test is very well done. I have no quibbles about how that is realised, but again so much of the true story of how a team of four thousand scientists laboured for three years to achieve it is simply ignored.The pacing is extremely uneven. A caption announces at the beginning '1. Fission'. Aha, I thought, it is in three acts. But there was no caption for 2 or 3. Perhaps the editor just forgot to put them in. May I suggest for a director's cut that these are '2. Boom!' and '3. The HR Panel Interview Concludes'.Flabby, unfocused and really a bit dull. It could have been so much more, in so much less time.","

Oppenheimer," A Celebration of Intellectual Movies
",heisenberg12,07-Aug-23,"Comic books, Marvel, Remakes, Franchises, and garbage is the norm.No, Oppenheimer is not perfect, but what people who criticize it fail to reach is that it's a rare type of movie these days. It's a historical true story, biopic, and character study. It will also be a frontrunner for Best Picture that will surpass in quality if it wins all Best Picture winners of the last ten years in terms of importance and meaningfulness.Now, with that being said, here is why it is crucial. Heisenberg was the key factor.My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.-Heisenberg.","

I liked what I saw a lot, I love a good borderline psychological horror deep dive into a tortured soul. A film like Spencer comes to mind after watching something like this.The moral conundrum between a scientific genius and the destruction he orchestrated is shown clearly in sequences before, during and after the bomb drops in Japan. The casting was perfect, the film is nothing short of a showcase in acting. It would've been nice to see more of Josh Peck and Devon Bostick, but everyone gives it their all here, especially Cillian Murphy & RDJ.The runtime might be intimidating for some, but it's worth it because in my opinion, not a second is wasted. And that test bomb drop might be one of the most insane things ever made for a film. My jaw legitimately dropped wide open and I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be experiencing this moment in the theater..

",giomcs,28-Nov-23,"This movie is brilliant. Nothing short of it. It has one of the greatest storytelling I've personally ever seen, but it excels in most of the categories of how you would classify a movie as good, for example the cinematography. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic. We all heard of the whole IMAX thing Christopher Nolan did but the scenes themselves are absolutely stunning. No spoilers, but certain scenes of the movie take place at different times in Oppenheimer's life and at every single one of those scenes they have a different sort of coloring to guide the audience as to what point in time are we watching, might be silly for most people but I personally enjoyed that since I'm easily distracted. One of the main critics I've seen to this movie was the fact that they ""humanized"" Oppenheimer too much, which I strongly disagree to because how can you humanize an actual person that existed too much? I think they just showed that he was never focused on killing people, just making the bomb but for some reason he did not realize that his bomb would be launched, would kill people and make one of the most horrible tragedies the world has seen, which at the end he does end up realizing, but it was too late. This is just my opinion though.","

Oppenheimer," artistic biopic
",SnoopyStyle,24-Nov-23,"It's a biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) from Christopher Nolan. Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) is his wife. Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is his communist mistress. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) is the military lead of the Manhattan Project. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) hires Robert after the war.This is an artistic biopic of highest production and daring from filmmaker Christopher Nolan. I do have some reservations about the accuracy with the importance of the material. I accept some of it as artistic license. First thing I noticed is the constant flow of music cues. Nolan is giving very few moments of silence with one major exception. Next, it's Jean picking the one specific page for Robert to read out loud. At that point, Nolan is clear that he is going to tie all the strings together in an artistic performance. The one false note is the evil Truman. I get that Nolan is trying to put Robert into a corner unless he really has a bug up his butt against Truman. What Truman says is actually true. He's the one who pushed the button, not Robert. It's just that Nolan has put such an evil spin on the character. Finally, there is Strauss. Nolan needs to foreshadow his turn a lot better. He needs to be a bombastic arrogant fool right from the start. Einstein passing him is too subtle of a move. All in all, I found this very compelling and the filmmaking is top notch.","

Oppenheimer," Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.
",andysaleen-05305,21-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched.","

Oppenheimer," 'Classic Nolan Art'
",Filmwalla-45998,21-Jul-23,"Nolan yet again proved that why he's one of the finest directors till date with 0 disappointing movies.. Oppenheimer is exceptional..! Brilliant at performance level..terrifying and horrifying tense music..highly convincing screenplay..terrific and beautiful visuals..dark and complex nature (not comparable toll to other Nolan classics)...
Literally Nolan itself - school of masterpiece arts ..
Oppenheimer is very great epic and non linear..It will sure shot very horrific movie not for every audience! If you are dying to watch pure drama portion oriented cinema, If you want to see some terrifying psychological brilliance and If you're fan of anyone who are involved in this film - Go For It!! Oppenheimer should remain forever until the drama school and making exist.","

Music all the way through the film which at times made me struggle to hear what was being said. Also felt that some scenes would have played better without music. Due to what felt like a rush to complete so many strands of his life, I never felt connected or to understand the man. A great cast but a film I would not watch again. I was never bored but it just did not have any emotional impact which surprised me. I am not a fan of nolan's previous film Tenet either.

",getsanjay,11-Nov-23,"I know my opinion may not be liked by Nolan fans, but I feel this movie was made unnecessarily complicated not because it helps the viewer or make it more entertaining but I feel just to portray a level of pseudo intelligence.Most of the time is spent trying to figure out which time period we are in with the multiple flash backs and flash forwards and even in the main two time periods also things are not kept chronological.In addition you need to either have a background of all the characters involved or then spend a lot of focus trying to remember which name belongs to which character as names are thrown left and right.And lastly I found the movie boring which is very rare for me as the subject was very interesting.","

Oppenheimer," Nolan...once again?
",manas19782002,30-Nov-23,"What's interesting about the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer other than he had conceived and created one of the world's deadliest weapon? NOTHING. Actually it's a tragedy. But how Christopher Nolan have executed that story for a 3 hour movie is spellbinding. It's like going into a trance and suddenly coming to your senses after 3 long hours. And believe me, you will be exhausted. I didn't watched this (or Barbie) in theatre as I don't want to support this in box office collection in oppose to 'MI:7', as I really wanted 'MI:7' to be a box office success, which it failed. Thanks to 'Barbenheimer'. But after the release of Blu-ray I watched this on my TV pausing and playing, rewinding, pausing and playing again to catch the essence and directing prowess of Mr. Christopher Nolan.When we watch a Biopic, we have the overall knowledge of a person from all the basic sources. The Director and the scriptwriter uses some extra resources. But it's the vision of the former and narrative expertise of the later which makes the Biopic an interesting one. After that, the selection of the actors and all the other departments hard work and dedication produce an epic movie like it happened in this case.It took me 4 &1/2 hours in a single sitting to finish this. And I came to the conclusion that this movie may be nominated in the Academy Awards in...Best:-Editing, Adapted Screenplay, Original Score, Cinematography, Production Design, Sound Effects and Mixing, Supporting Actor (Matt Damon/Robert Downey Jr.), Actor (Cillian Murphy), Director (Christopher Nolan) and Best Picture.My Rating 9/10.",NA

The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art.

Oppenheimer," Roundly superb, gripping, and thought-provoking (but also not without reasonable criticisms)
",I_Ailurophile,28-Jan-24,"From the filmmaker's lofty reputation, to the exceptional and large cast, including some reliably luminous names and faces and some others that have been less frequently seen over the years; from the dourness of the subject matter, to the ardor of the production and visual effects; from the noteworthy summer release alongside Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' a pairing which itself became a major phenomenon, to the incredibly high praise, awards, and nominations that have greeted the picture since: there is a world of information to digest concerning 'Oppenheimer' before we ever sit to watch. This is to say nothing of questions of how Christopher Nolan would approach what promised to be a more straightforward drama than anything else he has made; of the extraordinary runtime, far exceeding the bounds of what was once considered customary (90-130 minutes) to embrace what increasingly seems to be a highly questionable new normal (3 hours); of condensing even a fraction of a lifetime into anything resembling a conventional cinematic feature, let alone a life as full and busy as J. Robert Oppenheimer's; and among far more, of whether or not it remotely deserves the label I've seen, primarily but not exclusively from critic Richard Roeper, hailing it as ""one of the best films of the 21st century."" So what of it? Is this really everything that it's said to be?I have no qualms in saying that I disagree in some measure with the utmost stellar acclaim from which the title has benefited. It is my belief that certain lasting impressions are formed before even half an hour has passed, one-sixth the total length. One of these impressions is that the pacing is far too swift, disallowing scenes and ideas from manifesting, breathing, and resolving of their own accord; there is a vast wealth of terrific thoughts Nolan poured into his adapted screenplay, and it feels far too much like the movie speeds past or around them, one after another, rather than capitalize on them. This is partly owed to Jennifer Lame's editing, definitely, but even individual scenes and exchanges of dialogue fly by at a gait that's overwhelming, pointing to Nolan's responsibility as director. Other facets suffer in turn, no matter how outstanding in and of themselves: Ludwig Göransson's fantastic score, ably lending to the mood at any time and considerable tension and gravitas; the tremendous acting from that awesome cast, demonstrating superb emotional depth, range, and nuance; the hard-won, laboriously produced visual effects that have themselves been the recipient of substantial praise; and more - all reduced as they present to a fraction of what they could and maybe should have been. Three hours is a lot to take in, but strictly speaking, if every inclusion were as integral to the whole as we must suppose they were, and were unfailingly represented, then ideally the proceedings would have been maybe 5-10% less brisk, inherently increasing the length by ten minutes, twenty minutes, or more.It's not just about the velocity of the flick, however, but in my opinion also the surfeit of material. Throughout these 180 minutes the script speaks loquaciously, and in a non-linear, back-and-forth manner, to such a bounty of notions, that even without taking into account the rapidity of the proceedings it seems to me that no one thought is given all due consideration. There's Oppenheimer's magnificent intellect and highly learned mind, his education, his strident personality, and the arguable cult of personality; his associations and difficulties, be they personal, academic, professional, and/or political; the huge list of contemporary scientists, politicians, and otherwise figures whose names have gone down in history, and who all played roles of varying size, directly or indirectly, in Oppenheimer's life; the Manhattan Project, wrapping together issues of science, ethics, logistics, personnel, bureaucracy, and more; meetings behind closed doors of further development of atomic technology, of the conflicting personalities involved, and of questioned allegiances; touches of the staggering hypocrisies and backwards priorities of the United States, enduring even today, that ever minimize the dangers of authoritarianism and fascism and exaggerate the perils of anything remotely related to leftist sociopolitical leanings; the juxtaposition of the glory of scientific achievement, the sullen horror of how that achievement is to be employed, ugly jingoism, professional pride, and personal apprehension and dread; and still more. As all these elements ebb and flow throughout the length they are more or less given equal treatment, but still the sum total feels imbalanced, and still the question remains of whether or not any of it is really given the full treatment that it deserves.I think these are very legitimate criticisms of the feature, and I'd be lying if I said that they weren't foremost in my mind as the minutes ticked by. Further emphasizing the point, as a crucial moment in the course of events comes to pass, one looks at the clock to observe that there's still another full hour left. Much of that last hour focuses so heavily on the latter days of Oppenheimer's fame, and portraying him as having been railroaded for his views, that it almost feels as if we hadn't gotten any taste of it at all up to that point. Moreover, up until that last hour the supporting cast has been seen only briefly and intermittently, and it's only within that last hour that major players like Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr., seem to be given the stage on which to earn the award nominations that they have. True, it's also conceivable that all this - the brusque pacing, and the overflowing content - is intentional, a meta reflection of the fast progression of events and of the significant array of facets actually in play for these historical events and figures. Whatever the intent, however, the result is the same, and as far as I'm concerned the troubles I see with the movie threaten to drag down the excellence of the whole, and of every constituent part.That, I should say, would be deeply unfortunate, because while I take issue with aspects of 'Oppenheimer,' make no mistake that it is, far more than not, simply brilliant. Nolan gave himself a very difficult task in adapting Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's biography, and in trying to cohesively weave together all the minutiae that made the man who he was, and made him be remembered as he is. Bursting at the seams as the screenplay may be, and rushing almost heedlessly at some points, these figures are made out to be extremely complex, as is the story at large of which they are all part. The dialogue and scene writing are both terribly biting in the best of ways, and the sum total of the writing provides such fuel for the actors that even those in the smaller and less visible supporting parts shine luminously with the time they are given. Each in their own way, Blunt and Downey both illustrate why they are household names and respected powerhouses; less prominent, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Benny Safdie, Jason Clarke, David Dastmalchian, Dane DeHaan, Alden Ehrenreich, David Krumholtz, and still many more all make the most of their roles. Cillian Murphy, a fixture for Nolan and well established in his own right, gives a momentous performance to anchor the film that will surely stand as one of his greatest works as an actor. And all this, stitched together under the impeccably sharp vision of Nolan as a filmmaker, results in a biographical drama that not only hits hard at the most psychological moments, stirring strong emotions, but that also evokes earnest thriller airs. This is built in such a manner that the tension and suspense is achingly real and palpable. How many other biographical flicks can say the same?Yet the splendor of the title isn't just in the history it probes, the questions it asks, and the urgent thoughts it provokes. Inasmuch as the material zips past too quickly for its own good I do find fault with Lame's editing, yet her work is swell in and of itself, and some moments are wonderfully keen. The sound design is utterly marvelous, contributing in a big way at some key moments, and 'Oppenheimer' absolutely wouldn't be the same without the fabulous efforts of Willie D. Burton, Richard King, Gary A. Rizzo, Kevin O'Connell, and their crew. The effects really are stupendous, an immense credit to all involved, and from hair and makeup to costume design, sets, and filming locations every little detail herein that adds to the viewing experience is exemplary. There's so very much to absorb with this piece, and so very much to admire, and it's no wonder that it has been upheld as such a paragon of the cinema of 2023. At the same time, I find myself unable to unremittingly extend pure congratulations for the endeavor; great as this is by leaps and bounds, I remain put off by the flurry that it represents. I don't know what the answer might have been to ameliorate those difficulties, only that my favor is lessened for the fact of how overbearing the presentation often is, and sometimes arguably uneven. Be that as it may, there's no getting around what an accomplishment the feature is for Nolan, for his cast, and for everyone else who worked on it, and one would be awfully remiss not to watch given the chance. I think there are reasonable criticisms to level, yet overall 'Oppenheimer' is super, and I'm happy to give it my high recommendation.","

Oppenheimer," An important part of history
",Imme-van-Gorp,30-Dec-23,"There's no doubt that the idea of an atomic bomb feels vile and immoral, but there is also no denying that its existence (and thus, the stalemate of mutual destruction the world finds itself in now) has brought peace to our time like nothing else could have. One might call it a necessary evil or say ""the ends justify the means."" Of course, that will only apply as long as these bombs don't fall into the wrong hands; hands that could ensue a chain reaction resulting in the end of the world...All in all, this was a beautiful and compelling movie with stellar acting. This movie has certainly shown me that Oppenheimer was not only a true genius, but also a good person with the best intentions and perfectly human emotions and feelings.","

",djrmc24,22-Jul-23,"Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 10 out of 10 for me. Also I would rank it as one of Nolan's best films ever!","

Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless.","

Oppenheimer," A lot of hype...
",sunnyinjersey,22-Jul-23,"This thing has been talked about for what feels like the entire last year and it was simply... okay. The acting was good and the visuals are striking at time but the plot itself was kinda boring. They spent a bunch of time litigating his security clearance and like... honestly who cares ?? Lol. I was expecting more emphasis on the bomb itself. And sure the first two hours goes into that but the last hour dragsssss. I was expecting more dissection of the psyche of the people were affected by the bombs going off. You really only see it from one point of view - Oppenheimer's. And like okay we get it, he had major regrets about being involved. But who cares? I would've loved to see more from the victims point of view or the towns and cities affected. It was only okay and honestly expected more from a brilliant film maker like Nolan. Honestly I'm sure my opinion on the film is highly affected by the CRAZY STUPID HYPE surrounding this film. Mind you, when films have a lot of hype, I tend to temper my expectations. And I did with this one too, but even still it didn't live up to what I was expecting.If you're wondering if you should see this in theaters, I say no. You'll get just as much of the experience by watching it at home. Especially since the movie is soooo dialogue heavy and the bomb scene is super shot. Also, since this is a review with spoilers, it doesn't even show the actual bomb!!!! So stupid. Just the testing leading up to the bomb. I was here expecting some cataclysmic explosion and watching these towns get destroyed (in hindsight I know it's barbaric and I am not a sadist in the slightest, I don't even like true crime shows to the level most people do). But I just expected... more.","

Oppenheimer," Christopher Nolan gives us a brilliant drama with Cillian Murphy giving us his best performance yet, one of the best films of the decade - My Ultimate Review
",Holt344,26-Jul-23,"My expectations are always high for a film made by Christopher Nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. What we get is a three hour biopic of Oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. My girlfriend thought it was too long though so I think it's a preference. You could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. Stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like Strauss makes us see how others see Robert Oppenheimer and it only helps the story Christopher Nolan is telling. Any fan of Christopher Nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and It's done perfectly. Alternating between Oppenheimer's story from Cambridge to Los Alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and Strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959.Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer; Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project; and Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The ensemble supporting cast includes Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Benny Safdie. The cast is full of phenomenal actors, each portraying a real figure. Nolan even got Matt Damon out of taking a break from acting, Damon's role in the film is far from the best I've seen but I'm certain he did a terrific job portraying General Groves. The best performance goes to Cillian Murphy, hands down. He has been in multiple of Christopher Nolan's films and lots of others, but never in a leading role like this. Peaky Blinders were always the best performance which I have seen of his, but that changed with his role of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Portraying a person who has existed and one with the reputation of Oppenheimer, makes it you either fail or succeed. I'm sure Cillian Murphy nailed each mannerism, you see it through his performance how he pays respect to the real figure, for example the weight loss. He should be nominated for best actor and as it looks like right now, win multiple awards for the performance, the best performance of his career or so is my opinion. Other performances which I really liked and found memorable, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon to name a few. Though brief, Tom Conti was terrific as Albert Einstein and I could easily see a biopic be made with him in the role.Christopher Nolan did it again, a film which is looking to be a huge box office success and he does it in a way which seems oddly new to Hollywood, Nolan never changed as it was Hollywood who did. I'm of course talking about the over-reliance of CGI and visual effects. The big explosion in the film which is as real as you can get without actually blowing up a real atomic bomb, he uses practical effects and creates a stunning looking film because of it. You get immersed and the thought of things being fake never crosses your mind, because it aren't. Of course there's CGI in the film but used sparingly like the shots in space. It's a visually striking movie which Nolan has made and the IMAX only makes it so much grander. Ludwig Göransson is yet again working with Christopher Nolan and I can say they're a brilliant duo. Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from ""the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds"". This might be Ludwig's best musical score, it just might.Christopher Nolan began writing the script for Oppenheimer after he had finished Tenet, he had been envisioning the film for over 20 years before that. A primary theme of Oppenheimer is dealing with the consequences of Oppenheimer's actions, with Nolan opting to explore how consequences can affect people in a delayed manner as he felt people are not ""necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of your action in the moment"". I just think it's a fantastic screenplay, it also worked very well with it being written in first person which was a first for the director. The writing is perfect, like so much else. If I should find something to criticize, I would say the writing for its female characters. But honestly, it's alright, I don't mind and my girlfriend didn't mind either. This is a film about Oppenheimer, we get to see the story through his eyes and his eyes only, except for Robert Downey Jr's character.Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as ""magnificent"" and ""one of the best films of the 21st century"". Many critics share his opinion and honestly, I do too. Oppenheimer is on my top three films of Nolan's, The Dark Knight remains my favorite, but this is close to that. This might be one of the best films I've seen in the last year or two and I agree fully with ""one of the best films of the 21st century"".","

Oppenheimer," Excellent acting ruined by excessive pace
",jdlar-66-562021,14-Aug-23,"Christopher Nolan movies have always been fairly demanding of the viewer, but I think Oppenheimer finally takes it a step too far. The acting is superb and the subject interesting, but the pacing of the movie demands that the viewer is either 100 years old and has a clear recollection of the time, or has been researching the topic for the past several years in order to fully understand what is happening. The movie feels like a 3 hour long trailer, a speeding train that never slows down to allow the audience to catch their breath. There was a lot of great dialogue delivered by fantastic actors, but it is so mired in jump cuts and overly loud continuous music that it feels like a massive missed opportunity. The best way I can describe it is someone trying to perform a poetry reading in the middle of a techno concert. The movie certainly peaked my interest in Oppenheimer, and I will probably research this time in history more, but I am glad the movie is over.","

There is simply nothing interesting (for me that is) about this movie.There aren't any beautiful shots or suspenseful parts. If there was anything happening then the long runtime would have been fine but now it feels like a chore to sit through.You already know the outcome of making the atomic bomb and you already know America was the first to use one. The only new information about the man for me was the part about his personal life but it wasn't anything to write about apart from making the A bomb, and that is not enough to make a movie about.Once again, my opinion, maybe I am not seeing something about this that others did see.

It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry.","

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimer Is This Generation's Titanic In Cinema
",Destiny-1-12-15,08-Jan-24,"Oppenheimer is on par with being the biggest, historic event film since Titanic! Christopher Nolan directs a Masterpiece with this booming piece of art! Murphy whom plays Oppenheimer is absolutely exceptional! Well deserved to win the best actor/performance award at the Oscars! And also Robert Downey Jr whom plays Lewis Strauss also deserves an award for best supporting actor! The award ceremony could be awarded to many on the Oppenheimer set! Including Nolan for best director and for best score as well! Even best drama! Because creating, dropping an atom bomb is mighty dramatic! The film deserves to sweep in all awards category!

Oppenheimer," Three hours of pure happiness
",halcyonedit,26-Dec-23,"I left the theatre feeling a mix of conflicting emotions - a blend of happiness and dismay. The latter, as the weight of the movie's events sank in, and the former, knowing that cinema is still very much alive.Something I thought was particularly amazing in Oppenheimer is its perfect balance. The pacing of the film is spot-on. Every scene serves a purpose in driving the story forward. There's never an unnecessary moment, and I never felt like anything was excessive or lacking. It's a rare feat for a movie of this length to keep you engaged in this way, but Oppenheimer does just that. Despite the three-hour runtime, Oppenheimer's dynamic storytelling and editing choices kept me invested the entire time.After leaving the cinema, I found myself reflecting on the film, and there wasn't a single thing I would want to be different. It's is a complete and masterful work of art, and it's a testament to the dedication and artistry of everyone involved in its creation. From the sweeping landscapes to the intimate character moments, every aspect of the film is meticulously crafted. The cast is... what is there even to say? Every actor, no matter how big or small their role was, put in their 200%.Oppenheimer hits the mark in every way possible. It's an unforgettable experience, and I can't recommend it enough.","

Oppenheimer," Confusionheimer
",PizzaBizza,28-Aug-23,"I don't know man, was this really necessary? Three different time stages for just a biopic? Sure, it's Nolan and there is no way Nolan would tell a straight story, but overall the movie did not work for me. I mean, come on, just tell the story, spit it out man. From A (development of da bomb) to B (Military exploits it) to C (remorse and political aftermath). Is it necessary to mix this all up?1. Story Telling: Nolan is just not a good story teller. A nice twist here and there, or some surprise or revelation at the end would be fine, but Nolan just randomly throws us bits of information, it's so hard to follow. And pointing to some scene in the beginning of a 3h movie just to ""reveal"" that some dialog was not as expected in the end ... it's just not well told. Just tell the story from A to B to C and I would be satisfied.2. Music: The score was too heavy for the content. I remember a scene with really intense violin noise during a dialogue, as if something of upmost importance was revealed. But if it was I would not know. I found it hard to concentrate through all the noise. It was probably nothing, at least the movie just continued.3. Too much, much too much information, characters and garbage: I did not know who half of the characters were, their names, their function, their connections or goals. Best and most recognizable was probably Matt Damon. He was the only side character with clear goals to me. But the rest? I am not even sure what the two hearings were about. Revenge of Mr Strauss, but for what exactly? That he did not hear the dialogue between Oppenheimer and Einstein? Did he feel left out? Maybe it was explained, but I must have missed it.4. The technical side: The start was good, explaining the astronomical side of things, but I already thought to myself that the explanations were not good. If you don't have any knowledge of the matter you won't understand, and if you do you just nod understandingly. This was the first time of many I thought to myself that Nolan just does not care about his audience. He might want to show off some of his knowledge but in a way to constantly tell you how stupid you are not to understand the scientific or political backgrounds. I would have wished to see more 30's and 40's tech stuff, for example how they actually shot neutrons at atoms. Instead all we get is some oszillating waves on a spectrometer and that's it. That's the proof. No further explanation. The Trinity scene is awesome, probably the best part of the film, but even then Nolan had to switch constantly between character shots and the explosion. Man, just show us the explosion in one nice shot. That's what I am here for. To see the bomb get off.I left cinema like so many Nolan movies: Exhausted, confused and thinking I am too stupid to understand a simple bio pic. This is probably my last Nolan movie for some time. I need a break and a movie with a clear and understandable story line. Maybe something more like Lost Highway or something.","

Oppenheimer," ""Oppenheimer"" impresses with its technical primacy, showing the courage, the glory and the punishment for the Prometheus who delivered to us a globally deadly type of fire
",fernandoschiavi,29-Dec-23,"Christopher Nolan's film has the Trinity Experiment, the first nuclear bomb test explosion, as a divisive event not only for the film, but for the protagonist's arc that names the film. Oppenheimer is divided into three events: two hearings (which look more like trials) followed by bombings and memories of the scientist played by Cillian Murphy. While Robert Oppenheimer's perspective is portrayed in color, the world's view of the ""father of the atomic bomb"" is seen in black and white. The choice of this photograph highlights the Manichaeism placed on the scientist. Not about his experiment taking the lives of thousands of people, but about his loyalty to his homeland. Robert Oppenheimer had people associated with the American Communist Party around him, which caused discomfort for the American government.At times it is tedious to follow the narrative that drags on throughout the bomb construction process. Despite building tension around a race to get hold of the greatest tool before Hitler's army, the film takes too long to focus on this act. Although it is not the most didactic of Nolan's films regarding scientific theories, the events that follow the bomb are much more intriguing than the process. The rhythm also ends up being compromised by an editing that, in addition to bringing little dynamism to the work, confuses the viewer regarding the black and white sections. It is as if the director was unable to efficiently or safely stitch together those three events within the same narrative through a non-linear construction.The fact that Robert Oppenheimer was a scientific theorist commanding the event whose practice would determine the course of humanity brings an unsettling ambiguity. How could the only material work of a man of reflections be so deadly? There is also a touch of leniency within the film from the other characters who constantly elevate the protagonist's status, reinforcing his genius and even justifying it through his intelligence. Another issue that makes me uncomfortable is the way in which the film highlights Oppenheimer's romantic conquests with the female characters that orbit him. Nolan underlines this aspect of the scientist's biography, almost like a teenager entering puberty admiring a poster of his favorite rock star. This is also reflected in the way he treats the women in the narrative. Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) steals the spotlight for herself every time she enters the scene. As does Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), the scientist's lover. Both on screen are as powerful or more powerful than the bombs that devastated the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But unfortunately, their time is reduced in the plot to instrumental moments to celebrate men and their futile idealizations.Speaking of futility, the highlight of the film concerns the dispute between Oppenheimer and his hidden nemesis, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The revocation of his security clearance by the CEA - United States Atomic Energy Commission had been a trap set by Strauss as a personal vendetta fueled by an episode in which Strauss found himself humiliated and overshadowed by Oppenheimer. We see the exposure of antagonist and protagonist in what is the best third of the film. This is the part that brings us closer to these characters. The analogy of two scorpions trapped in a bottle that will inevitably try to kill each other is brought up. This same analogy applies to belligerent nations, also commanded by men, who, faced with weapons of mass destruction, put human life at risk for equally futile reasons disguised as sovereignty and patriotism.Citing some less inspired points of the narrative in the previous paragraphs, we have the birth of the bomb itself, which is a living character within the narrative, celebrating science, but also death. In the tedious process of creating this weapon, there is a repetition of the justification that it is necessary to produce it before Hitler's forces - Oppenheimer is of Jewish origin. This race against time seems to distract those involved from the possibility of the world's destruction. The reproduction of the bomb detonation during the Trinity Experiment is an immersive spectacle despite the director's morbid fetish. We are mesmerized by the image of fire. Silence perpetuates as we are placed in front of the shapes - almost always phallic - of the flames. Then, we are swept away by the burst of sound. This delay between image and sound brings, in addition to realism, a reflection on the power of destruction. We are practically transported to the site of the explosion, and it is almost possible to feel the heat. Fire consumes our gaze.It is not surprising that, considering the protagonist's important position in an essential period of History, Oppenheimer's trajectory includes interactions with dozens of notorious figures, which gives Nolan the opportunity to cast a cast made up of names that he would not normally accept. Making appearances so brief that, at times, they almost sound like extras - such as Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Jack Quaid, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek and Gary Oldman -, which sometimes distracts more than it adds to the production. On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon take advantage of the opportunity to play very different types of their usual roles: the latter, evoking the rigidity and discipline of a military veteran; the first, embracing the bitterness and insecurities of a man without any trace of the youthfulness that the actor usually brings to his characters. Meanwhile, Florence Pugh intensely projects Tatlock's psychological instability without allowing it to define that woman, while Emily Blunt escapes the trap of embodying the resentful wife stereotype by lending Kitty an interesting frustration with her husband's apparent passivity, which leads her to adopt a combative and brave stance.None of these performances would work, however, if the emotional center of the film did not feature the impeccable work of Cillian Murphy, who contrasts Oppenheimer's apparent rationality with his ideological, romantic and sexual passions that often lead him to commit impulsive acts (or make reckless statements) that make him unpredictable and, consequently, fascinating. It is intriguing, for example, to see him abandon his calm and discreet manner as he becomes excited by his students' academic interest, also displaying an inability to resist his desire for Tatlock and even his admiration for the irreducible principles that - notice the irony - keep it unreachable. In a similar way, the actor manages the feat of reconciling the subject's scientific obsession with creating the bomb and his humanist resistance to using it after it was built without this sounding like pure demagoguery or hypocrisy.Using Hoyte Van Hoytema's excellent photography to visually distinguish the narrative approach between Oppenheimer's subjectivity and a more distant (not necessarily objective) view of his life, the film jumps respectively between sequences shot in color and black-and-white - and the fact that much of the latter focus on Strauss also ends up establishing an important subtext about his worldview and that of the title character's more comprehensive view. Furthermore, the fabulous score composed by Ludwig Goransson is skillful in bringing harmonies that seem to see Oppenheimer's scientific epiphanies as something almost poetic, transcendental, seeing beauty in what could be restricted to equations and cold descriptions about the nature of nuclear fission. To top it off, Jennifer Lame's editing goes beyond the simple chronological break, employing almost abstract inserts that illustrate the protagonist's insights and offer a gateway into the way his mind operates.Unlike most of Nolan's filmography, which typically puts its efforts more into elaborating plots and less into the detailed development of the figures that move them, ""Oppenheimer"" can in some ways be considered a character study - and even though the events of Nolan's life physical aspects are relevant to the script, the filmmaker maintains the focus on the atmosphere of the narrative (at least, as perceived/felt by the protagonist). Here and there, of course, there is a certain exaggeration (I'm not sure that including the image of Oppenheimer naked and having sex with Tatlock in the room where he is being forced to discuss his intimacy is necessary, reinforcing in the viewer something that he had already understood), but in general, these more expressive interventions help the public get closer to a figure who could easily remain an indecipherable enigma. The moral aspects of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not at all ambiguous in the film's view, which disapproves of both the cynicism of the North American government (and military) - such as using the term ""artifact"" in place of ""bomb"" - as for his justifications for the attack, since Germany had surrendered months earlier and Japan was heading towards the same end. (I discussed this view - defended by many contemporary historians - in this post on my blog.) Not that the work seeks to absolve Oppenheimer, as he himself made a point of condemning himself, but the harshest looks are those aimed at politicians and military personnel directly. Involved in the decision to use the bombs, which includes the Harry S. Truman that Gary Oldman embodies as a proud and xenophobic scoundrel (which he actually was).Despite giving up action, ""Oppenheimer"" also impresses with its technical primacy, especially in relation to editing and sound mixing, valuing the viewer's perception and intelligence by delivering in the right measure everything that is necessary to understand the genius and torment of that which gave humanity the opportunity to make... humanity no longer existed. The courage, the glory and the punishment for the Prometheus who delivered to us a globally deadly type of fire.","

Oppenheimer," Politics Of The Bomb
",redcanofevil,21-Jul-23,"Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for. There is surprisingly little of the Nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". This was easier to follow and harder to watch than TENET.RATING: 7.5/10.","

Oppenheimer," Did I miss something?
",jamiewalton,19-Aug-23,"I was a huge fan of Christopher Nolan for years, but went off him following Tenet - a film that seemed like Nolan on autopilot and exposed his worst flaws. So, despite the massive critical acclaim surrounding this film, I feel my expectations were actually quite low.Yet, somehow, I was still disappointed.Nolan is a great director, but he works better when somebody else is taking the lead creatively. The script is a mess and often avoids following the most basic principles of writing, leaving nothing in their place.You might think, based on the trailer, that the film is focused on Oppenheimer developing the first atom bomb. And I wish it was. That's actually the middle third or so of them film. It's the best section of the film, but there are so many people thrown at the screen in such a short space of time that none of them are developed or especially (outside of a decent line here and there) memorable.Outside of that, we follow Oppenheimer on a breakneck tour of well-known scientists, most of whom serve no purpose. Take his meeting with Schrodinger. It's basically the two of them saying 'hi' to each other and then we never see him again.The bulk of the film (about two thirds) is devoted to people sitting around talking about Oppenheimer. It can be summed up as: 'He's brilliant, but can he be trusted?' repeated for almost two hours. Robert Downey Jr is in these sequences (he has nothing to do with the middle part of the film) and I'm not knocking his acting, but for a character with so much screen time he was exceedingly uninteresting. Oppenheimer made fun of him and now he doesn't like Oppenheimer, and that's his entire motivation for being the film's antagonist.Focusing more on the atom bomb project and taking time on the other scientists would have made for a much stronger and interesting film. Oh, except then the film couldn't be cut into a random order, which is apparently clever.I've seen so much praise for Nolan's work here, but I felt like even he felt the film was lacking. For around the first half of the film, there are random shots of explosions and stars with loud noises, as though he realised people might get bored. And, as is well known by now, Nolan mistakenly thinks that too loud = intense and that intense = good. There's no purpose for them, and I guess they stopped at a certain point because Nolan figured anybody who was still watching would be staying until the end.Cillian Murphy gives a fantastic performance, but once again I felt it was let down by the writing. I never felt enveloped in the story or especially cared for his troubles.A big problem this film had to overcome is we know that Oppenheimer was successful. If Nolan had got me really involved, I still would've been enthralled, but I never felt that interested.It's got an amazing cast who incredible performances and it looks amazing, but it was boring, and that's the worst thing a film can be.","

Oppenheimer," Or: Lewis Strauss Meets the Theoretical Physical Godzilla
",Quinoa1984,24-Jul-23,"A full throated, adult - I mean to say perfectly serious - epic story about American exceptionalism and how that is more likely than not a total crock; what the film is truly about, at least in my immediate estimation before I sleep on it, is how easily it is to make many, many enemies in a country that is at SuperPower status in a world where Nazism can fold and then Communism (or just you know anyone the Government disagrees with) can be next. It's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the Atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it.What I think made Nolan really want to make this a reality, aside from Oppenheimer being an endlessly fascinating collection of mixed emotions and thoughts and genius and ""blood on my hands"" level of guilt, is how power is so completely at the mercy of who gets to be in control - and what it means for a fubdamentaly decent person to reckon with the power to destroy (the apple scene early on is an apt metaphor). The Branaugh line about giving the world the power to destroy itself, and not being prepared. It's even more than that: some may think they are prepared, while others just try to wash their hands with it. And all the while, you are plunged and plugged into a first-person perspective like few others this high-wired and singular (Taxi Driver is in this league). Haunting, really.Lots and lots of thoughts on this I still need to digest, but easily Nolan's greatest achievement at least as a writer - the dialog is constantly involving and urgent and dramatically alive (and just fun to listen to) in ways I'm not sure I've experienced from him, and the structure is going to keep me going back to it another half dozen times in the next year or two - and Downey Jr, among a titanic heavyweight cast ranging from Gary Oldman to Macon Blair, almost steals the movie from everyone as a world class shitbag (or, your typical DC power-player who got scorned once). And the ending is devastating.Some more thoughts on a second viewing: I know JFK gets brought up in reviews and with critics (and even Nolan himself), but I thought of Born on the Fourth of July for the set piece when Oppenheimer gives the speech; when Ron Kovic talks to the 4th of July crowd and all the sound drops out except for a baby crying and helicopters, it's a subjective perspective of PTSD to an extreme.I think Oppenheimer has that as well, and it's a traumatic sequence that really got to me on a second viewing, not only the blinding white light and the woman with tatters on her face, but the subjects as he's stumbling out who are a) making out, b) crying, c) vomiting, and other things. It's astonishing the degree there and at a few other key points where Nolan means to break apart his mind through his editing and camerawork.And after all Oppenheimer is a theoretical physicist who thought he could maintain himself with what he was doing, and he absolutely could not.... but then I think Nolan's point here, as Stone maybe had with initially deluded boy scout Kovic and Vietnam, is that... who can ever face that? It's bigger than everyone on a psychic level. It's about how Science and Politics can't be compatible. That's chilling to me.Nitpick on this rewatch: Florence Pugh is not given a lot to work with past ""I'm kind of batty and tragic,"" and while Emily Blunt gets more to do and is terrific, and I dont mean to say Pugh phones it in on what she's asked to do, it seems kind of reductive that she is more of a story device. This doesn't mean she doesn't have a pivotal moment - I don't mean necessarily *that* line - the dialog right before it, where Oppy tells her about nearly poisoning his professor. Is he Jungian? Is he that kind of helmet from Full Metal Jacket, Born to Kill and Peace symbol? Not quite, it's more complicated than that... or maybe so simple. Which makes that Pugh's Isadora and her small role more difficult to accept.Or, to put it into comparison with the Aviator, which is strangely another film I thought of this time (not just because Nolan at one time wanted to make a Hughes biopic, rather both films deal with subjects who have mania and horrible weights on their shoulders, this one though far more grave), if Blunt is Katherine Hepburn than Pugh is Ava Gardner. Oh, well.","

Oppenheimer," Powerful docudrama
",grantss,10-Aug-23,"A dramatization of the life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bomb, thus helping end World War 2. We see his life from university days all the way to post-WW2, where his fame saw him embroiled in political machinations.I mainly watched this because it is directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Following, Inception, Interstellar, The Dark Knight movies, The Prestige, amongst others) and was intrigued to see what he would do with a subject which could easily end up being a conventional join-the-dots documentary.To nobody's surprise, Nolan does a great job, turning a docudrama into a powerful, engaging cinematic experience. You wouldn't know the film is three hours long, the time just flies by it is so engaging.Nolan is aided in his efforts by an all-star cast. Cillian Murphy is excellent as Oppenheimer but even the minor roles are played by big name stars, e.g Rami Malek, Oscar winner, appears in only two or three scenes and has a handful of lines.On the negative side, there are elements of style-over-substance - the special effects-filled cutaways were overdone as was the loud, droning music, an irritating recent addition to recent Nolan films - it started with Dunkirk and was there again in Tenet. In addition, some historical characters are cartoonishly drawn and some scenes feel a bit clumsy.Overall, a great film.","

Oppenheimer," Complicated Theatrical Rendition of a Complicated Individual
",drqshadow-reviews,04-Jan-24,"With Oppenheimer, his first biopic, writer/director Christopher Nolan once again proves he's up to the challenge of balancing a difficult subject matter with a very tricky character piece. The slow, careful process of scientific discovery is rarely friendly to film, and shy, socially-awkward introverts do not often make for compelling leads, but in this case Nolan juggles both and steps away smelling like roses. As he'd already done on more than one occasion, in decidedly different flavors.Here we track the career of a famed theoretical physicist, thrust into the limelight as the so-called ""father of the atom bomb"" during the crush of World War 2 and then dismissed by an ungrateful government after he'd outlived his usefulness and started asking difficult follow-up questions. Oppenheimer's frustrated early career, meteoric rise to fame and equally rapid fall from grace are depicted almost simultaneously, in a rush of confused, overlapped memories. This style of all-at-once storytelling, in which foreshadowing coexists with its own outcome, is reminiscent of the time-blurred motifs we've already seen in Tenet, Inception and Dunkirk. Here it serves as a compelling way to digest a lot of information in a very short amount of time, especially when paired with a head-spinning series of metaphorical visual effects and an entrancing musical score. I've read the book this film was based upon, a daunting 800-page tome, and after the first hour I felt like I'd just read most of it all over again. This time with a little extra dramatic pizazz.It's an impressive display of top-notch filmmaking, proficiently depicting a historical scenario in which everyone already knows the ending and climaxing with a tense, powerful visualization of the Trinity tests which first loosed the power of violent nuclear fission upon the world. I loved every moment, but then, I was already deeply invested in the subject and had done some homework. My wife, far less prepared, was also far less enchanted. I think this may be more of a knock on Oppenheimer the man than Oppenheimer the film. A complicated, often misguided individual who, for all his brilliance within the hidden world of molecular physics, was inherently flawed and broken in a human sense. Nolan makes no apology for this, baring the person (and his many blemishes) to the screen with no filter, and the results aren't always pretty.Perhaps a bit too long, especially in the painfully bitter, sixty-minute postscript, but I'm not sure where I'd want to see a cut. Certainly not a feel-good audience pleaser, Nolan's latest is an exhausting experience, but also rich, thoughtful and rewarding.","

",remuse-astra,04-Dec-23,"What of a world that is void of challenges, what of a world that is void of chaos of wars, what of a world that knows humanity. Torn between his love for the country and his passion of being a physicist, Oppie sees a world made up of atoms and how much we can harness the energies of our universe in understanding our own folly, that we as humans have gone beyond the lines to discover the secrets that make up our entirety.Perplexing as it may seem that all of us are made up of each other, all of us are the same, yet we fight with ourselves with ulterior motives and to see our own pulverize in the laugh of death. Oppie is a mastermind and his passion for quantum theories has made him the death itself. The is made with pure love of film making and the way how dubbing is not done in some cases to how the lighting reflects Oppie in all his moods, just brilliant. I was hoping Einstein could have been a little younger :).Princeton, Copenhagen, Los Almos, Caltech, AEC, Cambridge, heard it all in the movie and feels the same catch as I would have been a witness to those events that lead to this point in time.This movie is so raw and every scene of this movie takes me into the complexities and passion and vulnerabilities of this physicist. Where as he can read and speak Dutch (I thought it was closer to German than Dutch) and Sanskrit, it felt like a life story where I was just mutely sitting with them all throughout, it was a breeze watching all my favourite stars play their pivotal roles, the ones with Oscars and those in the line. Thanks Mr. Christopher Nolan for this extraordinary take on this quantum topic.It made me sad about all the thousands of lives were lost and still affected even today due to what had happened and what the physicists didn't hope would happen, a 9 starer maybe?Oh Murphy is so exceptionally brilliant in this character, love the part of Emily Blunt, Rami Malek, the enigmatic RDJ.

Oppenheimer," Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds
",jack_o_hasanov_imdb,29-Jul-23,"This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like C. Nolan. I also really liked this movie. The movie is told from Oppenheimer's point of view. I think it was fine. Some scientific topics were very difficult to understand for me. I think the bomb scene was good. I think the acting was very good. Cillian Murphy played the static, cold character very well. Robert Downey Jr. Played great too. I think tacting was generally so good. I think there were some boring scenes in the movie. There were scenes in the cinema where I started to sleep out of boredom. But overall, I think it deserves an ""8"" point. This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like it. I also watched the other movie (pink movie) first. It was so good after that movie.","

Oppenheimer," Amazing movie technically, but too long and a bit meh on the story
",Mrblue6,02-Aug-23,"Watched it twice now. It's definitely a very very good movie technically, amazing cinematography, brilliant acting from everyoneBut at least in my opinion, the whole story is just quite meh I guess. I could summarise the story in a paragraph without missing many details.Oppenheimer was a Jewish, ""suspected communist"", who brought Quantum Physics to the USA. His left wing mindset brought him some scrutiny from government officials and the like. He visits many univieraities and top minds through Europe, after which he returns to the California. He is recruited to head a top secret Nuclear Bomb project at a Los Alamos, NM, where a town was created for the scientists. At Los Alamos, the many scientists argued with each other on various things, some threatened to leave and others did leave. Oppenheimer had some trouble with his security clearance due to his ""communist links."" Eventually they complete the bomb, test it, it works. The US then bombs Japan twice. Many people are happy about the bombing, but many, Oppenheimer included are torn. They had built a WMD that killed countless innocent civilians. Oppenheimer is then scrutinised, through the doing of Strauss about his ""communist links"" and views about the H-Bomb even while he wasn't a communist at all. Strauss is testified against for wrongly bringing the case against Oppenheimer. The movie then ends with Oppenheimer realising/considering the weight of what he has done.I feel strauss didn't really add anything at all to the movie. Completely remove him and nothing really changes.I know it's based on a historical event, but like it's so obvious what would happen, scientists build a WMD that's scrutinised because it can be used for evil. They use the bomb, they realise what they have potentially just done. And that's really it.It's pretty obvious to me that building a WMD would bring about some morale conundrums.I think It was much too long, the third act was almost entirely unnecessary.","

Oppenheimer," What is the main theme of this film?
",ikoos-1975,02-Sep-23,"This film talks about very much themes, but none of them is developed enough: quantum physics, moral discussion, political intrigue, love, cold war, Marx, Freud, etc. Moreover, at the beginning of the film Oppenheimer reads the poem of T. S. Eliot, looks the painting of Pisasso, so you expect that the film has something interesting to tell about the connection between modern art and science, but is hasn't.Jill is an exciting, fascinating character, full of ambiguity - but you don't know enough about her to understand what she do and say, and first af all: why she kill herself? Robert Downey is magnific, but I was disoppointed enough when I realised Strauss characterized by him did everything against Oppenheimer only because the scientist once made him ridiculous. This is one of the main confilct of an 3 hours film?","

Oppenheimer," Wow! What a powerful and engagaing movie!
",prberg2,29-Jul-23,"Wow! This movie just knocked me out! So many parts of the movie were just excellent. I think I need a little time to fully process everything.. but I left the theater just in awe of the movie. Acting, script, cinematography, directing, score, sound, and visuals... were all just amazing.Nolan really knows how to make a really powerful film. It leaves you asking questions about war, and how the atomic bomb really changed things. I only had a few small issues with the film. It does sort of peak about 2/3 of the way through the film. At least in terms of actions of the film. Then it asks questions about what happens after you invent and use an atomic bomb. Really powerful stuff.. and it kept me interested the whole time.I loved seeing it in IMAX.. with the powerful sound especially. Although if you only get to see it in a regular theater.. that is ok too. But in a theater is the best way to see it for sure. Really awesome and it's such an inventive and powerful movie.","

Oppenheimer," Despite all the hype it was THAT incredible
",bmiller59,11-Aug-23,"If you read this or any reviews before seeing (which you shouldn't do) Oppenheimer, rush out and see it. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I knew enough about The Manhattan Project and Oppenheimer to prepare me for it. No surprises.Everything about this movie was exceptional. The cinematography sold Oppenheimer. Nolan filmed this in IMAX film which contributed to its magnitude. I've never been a fan of IMAX films but thought this was the film to see on the IMAX screen. I wasn't disappointed but I could have saved about $11 by seeing it in the digital theatre and probably would have enjoyed it the same. My one complaint though which was probably attributed to the IMAX theatre was the sound volume. A bit too much as it was difficult to clearly hear the dialogue.They nailed the sense out in the New Mexico dessert. I felt as if I was there. Was the Richter scale measuring earthquakes back then? From what I've read and heard in interviews, Nolan wanted the test to be as realistic as possible. I'm usually one to not be affected by sound affects, etc, but I was not prepared for the sound of the test explosion.The book which this movie is based on by Kai Bird, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer is now a must read for me.One small complaint/suggestion I have is that I wish it would have been dumbed down for us/me to understand more thoroughly.I can see a deluge of Oscar nominations in so many categories. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer better be nominated. Directing, screenplay, editing cinematography should also be nominations...but we'll see.I've tried very hard to not talk about any spoilers and for the most part I think I succeeded.See Oppenheimer, what an experience.","

Oppenheimer," Haunting tale of haunted triumph
",rickchatenever,14-Nov-23,"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a tale of triumph and apocalypse, as haunting and haunted as the man whose story it tells.J. Robert Oppenheimer was the brilliant theoretical physicist chosen to lead America's World War II effort to build an atomic bomb before Adolph Hitler did. For many filmgoers, writer-director Nolan's three-hour thriller provides the introduction to this world-changing figure. He was dubbed ""the father of the A-bomb"" by a grateful, war-weary America, but a few years later fell victim to McCarthy Era character assassination for his left-leaning political views.For me, the movie is not only sweeping and magnificent - it's personal. Oppenheimer was a name I knew well, ever since boyhood.My father, Dr. Alfred Chatenever, was one of the scientists who worked on the top-secret program to develop the bomb, dubbed The Manhattan Project. The project eventually stretched across the country all the way to the tiny town of Los Alamos, secretly constructed from the ground up in the middle of Nowhere, New Mexico. But my dad's assignment kept him in Manhattan, working in a clandestine lab hidden in a converted parking garage.All of this was highly classified at the time. My dad couldn't even tell his wife what he did, or explain to anyone else why he wasn't with the rest of the boys over there in Europe or the South Pacific. But in the years following the war, all three Chatenever kids eventually heard the stories. We knew the players destined for key roles in Nolan's complex narrative - not just Oppenheimer, but other scientists including Albert Einstein, Nils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Edward Teller. And Army General Leslie Groves, who oversaw the two-billion-dollar project - that's billions in 1940s dollars - and personally picked Oppenheimer to guide it.Stops on Chatenever family summer road trips in the '50s included Oak Ridge, Tennessee, another city built in secret, to house laboratories and facilities to enrich the uranium needed for the bomb. On another trip, we visited Los Alamos itself.Like Oppenheimer, our dad carried the weight of the bomb on his conscience for the rest of his life. True, it ended World War II ... but it also ushered in a new age perhaps more lethal in its ultimate consequences than the firestorm explosions that leveled the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, claiming more than 100,000 lives.Working on the bomb had been a moral imperative at the time. Many of the scientists were Jewish, knowing all too well the consequences if Hitler got the bomb first. But once it was clear that Germany's efforts wouldn't succeed, the prospect of whether or not to drop the bomb on Japan became far more ambiguous. A number of top scientists on the project signed a petition urging President Harry Truman not to use the weapon.It was all grist for the mill in discussions around the Chatenever dinner table. So I had a leg up before setting foot in the theater to see Christopher Nolan's version of these events based on the book ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.In the lead role, Irish actor Cillian Murphy doesn't portray Oppenheimer so much as he resurrects the boundless genius and many failings of this complex man. Trained at Harvard, Oxford and Germany's University of Gottingen, Oppenheimer received his PhD at age 23. He introduced America to quantum physics, and spoke six languages including Sanskrit, but might as well have been wearing one of those T-shirts embossed with the words ""I'm with Stupid,"" atop an arrow pointing at his crotch. His activities supporting leftist causes would also come back to haunt him when an intellectual rival Louis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) targeted Oppenheimer out of a misplaced sense of betrayal.The genius of Oppenheimer and his peers was accompanied by mighty egos, deep insecurities and rock-star vanity.Just keeping track of all the details of the story would be daunting enough, before trying to recreate the sights, sounds and textures of '40s and '50s America so authentically. But filmmaker Nolan further complicates matters with a nonlinear script, sometimes in color, sometimes in black and white, that jumps back and forth between key incidents - both high and low - in its protagonist's career.Every detail of Nolan's screen artistry shimmers with blinding brilliance, like micro glimpses of the staggering power unleashed by splitting an atom. Atoms, of course, are invisible to the naked eye, but ""Oppenheimer"" makes invisible things visible, just as it takes us into the greatest scientific minds of the 20th Century and helps us see what they saw.In a movie season generally devoted to mindless action for the dumbed-down masses, it's a thrilling work of intellect and taut excitement, providing lessons in history and science against panoramic backgrounds worthy of a classic Western.Cillian Murphy's star turn is not the only great performance in ""Oppenheimer."" Emily Blunt as his alcoholic but ultimately tough-as-nails wife Kitty, is superb. So is Matt Damon's Leslie Groves, whose exchanges with Oppenheimer feel electrically charged. Oscar winners like Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek show up in cameos, attesting to the quality in every facet of Nolan's grand design that's only slightly less ambitious than the Manhattan Project itself.When the Los Alamos scientists successfully exploded their first bomb prototype in a test labeled Trinity, Oppenheimer is said to have recited from memory a Sanskrit passage from the Hindu spiritual text the Bhagavad Gita:
If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst in the sky,
that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One -
I am become death, the shatterer of worlds.Our faith in technology was the ace in the hand that helped us win World War II. But three-fourths of a century later we keep learning that the legacy of believing in technology is unintended consequences.It's an ironic postscript that the great minds that created the atomic age left it to new generations that not only lack their intelligence and wisdom, but fear them as well.","

Oppenheimer," Great Biopic About a Man Who Changed Everything
",Reviews_of_the_Dead,07-Aug-23,"This was a movie that I was intrigued when I heard it was coming out. I do enjoy Christopher Nolan's films. I'm a bigger fan of Cillian Murphy though. I knew that this was a speculate so I was trying to see how I could fit this into my schedule. The three-hour runtime was daunting as well. The Gateway Film Center has been showing this on 70mm so I wanted to see it that way. The stars aligned on a Sunday for me to catch this.Now I'll be honest, I didn't know a lot about J. Robert Oppenheimer ahead of seeing this. I made the connection that he was part of the Manhattan Project, but outside of what happened with the atomic bomb being dropped twice on Japan and looking up a few things ahead of seeing this, I was a blank slate. Murphy does an amazing job at taking on this role. This could be his career defining performance to be honest.He's also surrounded by an amazing cast. His second wife is Kitty (Emily Blunt). He was also married to the amazing Florence Pugh who takes on the role of Jean Tatlock. That's just for his personal life. Robert brought quantum physics to the United States so we see him studying in Europe and meeting the likes of Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer) and Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). We also see how smart Robert is and driven when he puts his mind to something.To just give a bit more about what this story is doing, we have two threads. The first is for the Manhattan Project to succeed in creating the bomb ahead of the Germans. There is also the concern with sharing too little or too much with the Soviets who were in the beginning an ally. Robert rubbed elbows with communists, but he never truly joined them. It was a fearful time though and McCarthyism was in full effect. The other tense thread involves Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) who wants to become a cabinet member. He hired Oppenheimer, but the two butted heads. Lewis plays the puppet master in getting Robert to lose his security clearance. This has greater ramifications as well.Aside from the names I've given here, we also have the likes of Scott Grimes, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, David Krumholtz, Alex Wolff, David Dastmalchian, Matt Damon, Dane DeHaan, Jack Quaid, Gustaf Skarsgård, Oliva Thirlby, Casey Affleck, Remi Malak and James Remar. I'm sure there's more as well, but that was a quick glance over the names.Where I'll leave off is that this is a tense movie about history. Did I need to see this in 70mm? Probably not, but I get to say that I did. There is an arthouse flair while still directing to the mainstream. Will this win awards? I believe that it will. It might not make as much as Barbie, which came out the same day. I will bet this is the better of the two movies. It's just not for everyone. This is a sad and uplifting tale of a man who was extremely important to the world of science and changed the world like none other. See this movie.My Rating: 9 out of 10.","

Oppenheimer," Very Good; Not A Masterpiece
",shadhuahmed,17-Nov-23,"Stripped of all the usual hype that accompanies a new Nolan release and the whole BARBENHEIMER hoopla surrounding it, the film itself is not exactly groundbreaking. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a monumental achievement in terms of box office success, and it's a fine film. But storytelling-wise, there's nothing here that hasn't been done before with less pretension.I don't think splitting it up in black-and-white and color segments (à la MEMENTO) was really of much help to the audience as much as it was to the filmmakers themselves. And I wish Nolan wasn't so hung-up on packaging it as a thriller. The frenetic editing throughout, the constant droning of violins and electronic beats in the background to make sure the ones with short attention spans never check out of the film, and the sloppy transitions in the moments where Oppie has visions of the world beyond and his past and future fumbles almost took me out of the movie.But it was a relief to see Robert Downey Jr. Going all-out in flexing his acting chops after playing the same character during the most robust period of his acting career.Nevertheless, out of the most remarkable battery of cast and crew that worked on this project, if I was given the chance to pick only one name whose work was indelible to the unique set of feelings this film enkindles, it would be the composer Ludwig Göransson. His score is unconventional and welcoming at the same time. It is alienating, yet it guides you through the range of emotions the characters experience, unfailingly.And those who complained that they didn't understand most of the movie were simply not au fait with the general history of the Manhattan Project and the trials of the central character. You don't need to know EVERYTHING about Oppenheimer (and there's barely 15 minutes of hardcore physics jargon in the entire film) to understand what's going on; watching a decent documentary on the subject before going in should've more than sufficed (I'd suggest the PBS America special ""The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer""). Not having English subtitles in theatres didn't help non-native English speakers much either, I guess, which was even compounded by the weird sound-mixing fetishes of Nolan.But the most obvious deterrent to the enjoyment of this movie is the fact that audiences the world over have probably simply lost the patience to sit through a movie that employs the most basic of cinematic apparatus to tell a story: People talking to each other and sorting stuff out; in other words, unadulterated drama.It's just sad that a film like this needs promotional gimmicks like ""ALL PRACTICAL, NO CGI!"" and ""WITNESS A SCRIPT WRITTEN IN FIRST PERSON!"" to put more butts in theatre seats.",NA
Oppenheimer," Cillian should at least get nominated
",Tovi_Se7en,29-Jul-23,"I can't express enough how absolutely phenomenal this movie is. It will stand the test of time and will possibly go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.The movie is three hours long and at no point does it lose your attention. Cillian Murphy should, and probably will, get nominated for an Oscar. And he probably will get it. I don't want to spoil anything, but from the practical visual effects, to every single performance, every aspect of this movie is inspiring. I saw it the weekend it came out and will be buying the blu-ray as soon as it is released.I would also like to add that Robert Downey Jr. Should also be nominated for an Oscar because he absolutely nailed his performance in every way possible. I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. Me, my wife, and my 19 year old son were all completely blown away.","

Oppenheimer," An immersive tale of the famous physicist
",SonGoku540,28-Nov-23,"Christopher Nolan, known for his epic storytelling, skillfully captures the emotional journey of the Father of the Atomic Bomb. Rather than focusing on the bomb's creation, Nolan takes a captivating approach by delving into the life of its creator.Cillian Murphy delivers an award-worthy performance as Oppenheimer, skillfully navigating the complexities of the physicist's character. Robert Downey Jr. Surprises audiences with a convincing portrayal of Lewis Strauss, showcasing his versatility as an actor.Emily Blunt's depiction of Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, adds depth to the film, while Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, and the supporting cast elevate the overall movie experience.The film's remarkable achievement lies in the absence of CGI during the A-bomb detonation in Los Alamos, resulting in one of its most impressive sequences. Other highlights include Oppenheimer's post-war speech, interactions with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), and well-crafted dialogues.The extensive 3-hour duration may test the patience of some viewers, but those captivated by the narrative should find it acceptable.The film's use of scattered timelines, a key aspect of the screenplay, may pose a challenge for viewers with limited knowledge of Oppenheimer's life. Prior familiarity with the physicist's background could enrich the viewing experience.While the first hour is less intense than the second, potentially impacting overall engagement, the transition between monochromatic and color scenes may not resonate with all audiences. The multitude of characters could be confusing for those unfamiliar with Oppenheimer's story.Christopher Nolan's direction skillfully captures the highs and lows of Oppenheimer's life, expertly navigating the journey of the theoretical physicist.The film stands out with exceptional sound design and a Ludwig Goransson score that enhances key scenes, resulting in an award-worthy outcome. The cinematography is outstanding, though some unnecessary scenes in the first half could have been trimmed by the editor. The film's impressive production values shine, particularly in the depiction of the Atomic Bomb explosion without CGI.Christopher Nolan reaffirms his storytelling prowess in ""Oppenheimer."" Cillian Murphy delivers a commendable performance that is sure to earn him prestigious awards. However, the scattered timelines and unnecessary scenes might cause confusion and boredom for some viewers. If you can look past these aspects and stay engaged with the plot, then it is a must to witness Nolan's cinematic magic.","

Oppenheimer," Sound editing is the real hero of this film
",ShaanChaudhry,21-Jul-23,"A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.While both Interstellar and Inception were extremely deep films from Nolan(and in my opinion his best work), there was a popcorn quality about those films where you could loosen up and not take the experience too seriously and still find it entertaining. With Oppenheimer you better pay close attention to the dialogue and what's going on because you will be lost. With that being said it is rewarding getting a glimpse of the drama surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, some of the darkest times in human history. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will be his defining role of a lifetime. The acting from the cast was flawless along with the brilliant sound editing. I expect this film will be force to be reckoned with at the Oscars.","

It was paced right and insightful, this is another reason why the film suffers under the rush of the first 45.The last hour was Ok. The conspiracy/twist/betrayal wasn't brilliantly handled but it was Ok.All in all, I felt this was a missed opportunity.

The movie is too long and made bitty with a non-linear narrative which I found completely unnecessary. The viewer is usually distracted with scenes from the future showing his trial against some people. Those distractions are too long and very annoying. There are too many characters and they are all underdeveloped. I didn't understand what the point is in deliberately confusing the viewer.Also it is not possible to understand the viewpoint of the filmmakers. Are they heroizing or disparaging Oppenheimer for developing an atomic bomb? I think they are undecided and this is why they created such a mess.

Certainly, peace cannot be ensured by constructing a more formidable weapon.The film is aesthetically pleasing, albeit lengthy; however, it never loses its grip on the audience. To be candid, the inclusion of some nudity seems intended to captivate the audience's attention but could have been presented more tastefully.The cast is exceptional; witness one remarkable performance after another.

He brilliantly captured Oppenheimer's intellect, determination, and moral dilemmas, making the character come alive on the screen. Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. Also, Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did an excellent performance. This is by far Downey's best performance, and he also deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with outstanding performances from Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.From the first frame, the film immerses its audience in a spellbinding narrative that perfectly balances historical accuracy and captivating storytelling. The attention to detail in depicting the era is unparalleled, transporting viewers back to the 1940s and the intensity of the Manhattan Project. The meticulous recreation of the Los Alamos laboratory and the wartime atmosphere adds an authentic touch, making the viewers feel like eyewitnesses to a defining moment in history.The cinematography deserves special commendation, as it brilliantly captures both the beauty of the New Mexico landscape and the intensity of the laboratory's scientific endeavor. The haunting musical score adds an extra layer of depth, heightening the emotional impact of critical moments throughout the movie.""Oppenheimer"" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to educate, entertain, and provoke introspection. It expertly delves into the complex interplay of science, politics, and human morality, reminding the profound implications that scientific discoveries can have on the world.Christopher Nolan has once again proven why he is one of the greatest directors of our time. Brilliantly written, impeccably directed, and expertly performed, the film leaves an indelible impression that will stay with viewers long after leaving the theater.","

Oppenheimer," Not something I want to re-watch
",mosquitocyn,29-Jan-24,"It is a good movie on a tough subject. Well acted and well casted. But there's too many abrupt time jumps that makes the movie rather messy and required much concentration. It's ok if it is a regular length movie but this one takes about 3 hours. It's just too long and created some boring moments. After 2 hours of long dialogues though some parts are quite interesting, the audience then only gets to see a bit of fiery action rather than dialogue. I thought I would have an experience like what A Beautiful Mind or Schindler's List would bring but I was quite happy when the movie ended as though it was interesting, it actually exhausted me.","

Oppenheimer," A film that commands your attention and respect.
",FONYMAHONEY,12-Jan-24,"This is the closest Chris Nolan has ever come to making the perfect movie. Not one bum note of dialogue - intelligent but accessible, naturalistic but rousing. The greatest ensemble of actors assembled for a single picture in recent memory, and every single performance across the board is pitch perfect. Something Nolan has, if we're honest - struggled to attain in any of his output until now.Visually, the thing is next level and then some. The attention to detail alone is enough to grab the viewer and never let go for three hours, but then you have the classic Nolan BIG set pieces. The colourful ballet of the nuclear test, the silence - I can't recall a single scene from cinema that's had me so enraptured and terrified. Just magnificent.Damon's best performance ever. Downey, Jr's finest since Chaplin. Emily Blunt delivering such a compelling turn as Kitty, her name should already be etched onto her Oscar.Cillian Murphy. The finest film actor of his generation, giving the one of the greatest performances of any generation. A towering achievement of subtlety & brilliance.That said, it still isn't perfect - it's still a Chris Nolan film. Too much music telling you how to feel in almost every. Single. Scene. In a story as intimate as the troubled life of one man, it feels a little needless and it definitely drew me into an eye roll more than once.However, If like me you're not a Nolan fan generally - you should still make the time for this film. You won't regret a single minute. It's really terrific.","

Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history.","

",raja_sarkar,03-Sep-23,"I don't think this movie hits my expectation. The emotional aspects and drama overshadows the intricate details of physics and chemistry that should have been more prominent and masterfully depicted. Watch this movie thoroughly and you'll notice that Mr. Oppenheimer is not contributing much to the bomb creation, not even showing much of a leadership quality during adversities. He's depicted as a creature of emotions. The fact that he's womanising is not clearly depicted. The only character that I am thoroughly impressed with and the only character that have driven this lose movie is Robert Downey Jr.'s character. He's the reason you found ""something"" within this movie. And what special effects are they talking about? There ain't one! I am getting little weary of Nolan's reputation overshadowing his recent works!","

Oppenheimer," Time Jumbly (7.8)
",JackRJosie,09-Aug-23,"Interestingly enough i didn't mind the length. I do enjoy sitting in a dark room staring at a massive imax screen for 3 hours more then i thought i would. Mostly because this movie is really quite beautiful.Christopher Nolan has become one of those directors that has amassed a cult following that has trouble saying anything wrong about his films. For heavens sakes he's just a bloody man! I'd say probably a bit of a pretentious one.I mean really, why must his films be so convoluted. Ever since 'Interstellar' Chris' films have been personally categorized as ""overly complicated"".Everything is fantastic about this film, except for the fact that its dense dialogue makes the story feel more confusing then it needs to be. You get to a point where you just give up trying to catch up. Thats not a nice feeling when watching a film.- It also doesnt help that this film isn't chronologically linear. For heavens sake Christopher Nolan, you are a good director! You do not need to do some creative time jumbly in every film to stand out! It killed dunkirk for me, and almost killed this one too. It only serves to add to the convoluted nature of the movie.This guy likes to confuse his audience.... there is a plus to his confusion though...
With each watch-through the films get better and better.","

Oppenheimer," All round excellent biography
",snoozejonc,22-Jul-23,"The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer.This is an intense and thought-provoking portrayal of one of the most influential people in history. Much of it is about the demons he carried for developing such a destructive power, and the politics involved in his rise and fall. All of this unfolds in a compelling way. It includes numerous great scenes of dialogue, brilliantly acted by the likes of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.The scenes detailing the Manhattan Project are wonderfully constructed with outstanding set design and an incredibly effective reconstruction of the Trinity Test. Do not expect too much scientific detail about quantum physics, nuclear reactions and how the bomb works, as the film focuses more on Oppenheimer's role as a driving force to get it done, his relationship with other key players, his personal life, and the fallout of how he conducted himself during the project and other moments of his career.Visually it is generally fantastic as you would expect from Christopher Nolan, who uses a number of striking images to portray the mental state of the lead character at various points of the story. Plus the sound effects are suitably jarring during shock moments. Oppenheimer gives a victory speech to a crowd at one point when the implications of his actions start to overwhelm him and this is immensely well done.Some moments (Einstein) feel like they are given artistic licence for cinematic reasons, but as long as you research what is fact and what is fiction, alongside watching the movie, you should be better informed. In fact, I would say it is essential that you get background information about certain individuals before seeing the movie, particularly Lewis Strauss, as it will provide context around certain scenes.For me it's a 9.5/10, but I round upwards.","

I watched this in an IMAX theater so all the sensory effects with amplified. The actors were amazing too.But a word of warning, please go in with the correct expectations. This is a 3 hour long movie that portrays the life of Oppenheimer through the good and bad.The only gripe I had with the movie was that the last hour could have been shortened to about 20 minutes, but that's more of a personal subjective preference.Despite the tiring 3 hour watch, its an overall an outstanding movie and will definitely stand amongst the classics against the test of time.","

For me Nolan needs to ease off little bit and do comfort zone movie , something more ""for normal people"" , and yet you kinda wish his next film will be another complex, hard to swallow and watch masterpiece , like this on.. 8/10 is enough for me bc i am little bit disappointed with focsuing on politics rather than oppnehimer´s inner battle before and after the Trinity / Hirosima / Nagasaki - i expected more depression scenes, more fighting with himself.","

The film is filled with numerous scenes that unfold at a high speed, making it difficult to catch every dialogue. This fast-paced approach, unfortunately, hindered my overall enjoyment.While the film has received positive reviews, my personal experience was not as positive as I had anticipated. The rapid pace, combined with the abundance of scenes, made it challenging to fully grasp the subtleties of the storyline and connect with the characters.The film's dialogue, crucial for understanding the narrative, often got lost in the whirlwind of scenes, leaving me longing for more clarity and coherence. Despite the hype surrounding the film, it did not live up to the expectations set by its positive reviews.Additionally, it's worth noting that the film's IMDb ranking may not fully align with my personal viewing experience. While others may appreciate the director's unique style and innovative approach, I found it to be a bit overwhelming.In conclusion, Oppenheimer's film, with its abundance of scenes and high-speed sequences, may not be everyone's cup of tea. The challenge lies in keeping up with the rapid pace without sacrificing the essence of the storyline. Perhaps, for some viewers, a second viewing might provide a deeper understanding.My Rate is 8/10 in IMDB Website but it is not my Real belief

It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies.

Had it been created any other way this would have been a disaster but Nolan's a very skillful director combining his vision and his perfect pen to give us this wonder of a result. This movie contains so much of the contemporary talent in today's Hollywood. All the A listers are here. Everyone realised that this is a very ambitious project. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his nuanced performance as the titular role. Robert Downey Jr has every opportunity to prove with this one his immense talent. Emily Blunt has sadly a small role but in her words lies the essence of the entire movie. The writing is so good that it wraps up the entire plot so tightly and every little detail falls at place.

Oppenheimer," Unlikeable womanizer builds a bomb
",rileypatrick30,23-Jul-23,"Acting was great, considering the plot is a boring documentary buried underneath a pretencious confusing cerebral adventure through multiple timelines. This movie was seemingly written by somebody who is old and confused, unable to piece the story together in a coherent way but able to remember it in extreme detail. A collection of trailer-like cuts almost built for a generation of people with a shorter attention span, making me feel like i was being explained the story instead of watching it.I know this opinion will be disagreed with, but I hated this movie and really couldnt wait for it to end. Yes, yes, the actors are great. Downey performed a character that is interesting and devious, the lead, Cillian Murphy, was very good and carried the movie all the way through. Unfortunately he was forced to carry this documentary on his back because of the poor story construction and other charcters getting minimal screen time.Oppenheimer was a physicist, a theory and math based profession that is extremely hard to make appealing to people or to properly explain. Why this was chosen to be a mainstream movie instead of an 80 min documentary produced by netflix is beyond me. So kudos to the effort, it was a solid attempt. However the cerebral almost Kubrick like story exposition was hard to digest when used to tell a more fact based history of a boring man building a bomb.","

Some unnecessary nude Florence Pugh scenes, which is quite unusual for Nolan.The acting was excellent. But there is too much dialogue and characters being introduced every scene.The part where he is supposed to speak Dutch in Leiden, Netherlands, is not the Dutch language at all.

I definitely want to give it a second look so I can obtain a clearer understanding of all the different characters and moving parts. But once the intensity begins, it does not let up and it builds and builds and builds until the breathtaking conclusion.I am so grateful that I didn't watch this with my elderly parents as there is some nudity and a couple of unexpected sex scenes within the first half. But I must admit, seeing Florence Pugh naked did not suck.I was quite surprised by the performance of Robert Downey Jr. He plays a wicked dude and plays him very, very well. So convincing. Bravo performance, perhaps his best??Cillian Murphy, my dog. He was stunning. How he could transform into Oppenheimer and capture his conscience and internal struggle the way he did. Just wow, I felt all of that. It was heavy on the soul. When the film ended I literally gasped.Christoper Nolan, simply genius. He created a film here that rocked me to my core. It excites me to know that he is just in his early 50's and has many projects ahead of him 🤞 He is a rare gem in Hollywood.We completed Barbenheimer today. We started with Oppenheimer and then it was on to Barbie. I recommend that order if you decide to go through with it. In Opp you contemplate the terrifying darkness we humans are capable of. It is true horror and an all to real and unsettling look into our nature. Barbie is a fun little movie with some surprising depth. There were some profound moments where Barbie marvels at the beauty that is present within humanity. Kind of healing and balances things out nicely.

Oppenheimer," A Technically brilliant film with a story most people probably know?
",fraser-simons,16-Nov-23,"I think this was undeniably technically brilliant, but I also am left thinking that, aside from the minutiae of the antagonistic relationship the doctor faced in hearings, post bomb-drop-it was a story most people already know? Maybe it's my benefit of being educated in Canada on the subject, but I generally knew the larger story and ramifications, again, just not the granular details of the main himself. Such as his womanizing and movements in adult life.So, it's a story worth telling and it's well told. There wasn't anything to put it really high in the echelons of amazing films, some of which Nolan has made, I think. Perhaps the hype affected me. Maybe a home viewing in 4K HDR and surround sound loses something as well. But I can't say I was excited to see it in a theatre with its length. And I'm glad I made that decision now, to be honest.

Oppenheimer," Let this be the art we speak of (2023 list excerpt)
",TheVictoriousV_Listicle_Blurbs,01-Feb-24,"""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.""It's almost laughable to try to say something about Oppenheimer that hasn't already been said. This was the movie that made everyone realize the sheer power/potential of not just the theater-going experience at its best (unattainable with pretty much any home video set-up), but of audiovisual art, period. A musing on annihilation itself, visualized at both the cosmic and the sub-atomic level; a movie that plays for three hours, yet is edited and scored in such a way that it maintains an intensity that rarely lets up, eventually making our hearts literally pound against our chest as the Trinity bomb, which had already been made a most foreboding ""character"", is about to detonate; a picture that (and here's arguably the best part) treats us to the first instances of nudity on 70mm IMAX film.All the while, it treats us to some of the best performances and dialogue of the year, where even the teensiest side character has a memorable scene wherein the delivery is pitch-perfect and brief glances speak a thousand additional words. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer is a defining moment in the careers of both Christopher Nolan and the actor.It isn't difficult to see why, for all the soul-shattering visuals that appear in this film, its true spectacle is often said to be the human face. The movie is about something of unthinkable immensity, yet it is also intimate.I keep re-editing my initial review of it, desperate to do it justice without also accidentally over-selling it. I want to articulate just how much this movie rocked me to the core -- and evidently did the same to many other filmgoers -- without creating the wrong hopes.As I said before, though, almost everything has been said at this point and it's not like the movie needs my help. Innumerable people clearly saw it, many of them realizing/re-learning what sort of filmmaking we COULD get, even in the realm of Hollywood -- Hell, the movie even sold out on Blu-ray in an age where most everyone thought physical media was finito and streaming's where it's at. The response to this movie is already everything I could hope it would be.I guess I can offer this supplication: Please, keep seeing films like this. Let 2023 be the start of something great. Let this be the art we speak of.","

Oppenheimer," ""Can you hear the music?""
",Aziz24,29-Jul-23,"Synopsis: Oppenheimer handles a huge project of the creation of the atomic bomb that leads to all kinds of consequences on his personal life and many others surrounding him. This leads him to be the father of the atomic bomb and ""the destroyer of worlds"" as he becomes one of the most important figures in history.Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer himself in a lead role for the first time in a Nolan film, after being in most of his films. Cillian Murphy looks nothing like the real Robert Oppenheimer physically. Yet, Murphy is able to portray the famous figure in a role that would lead him to win an academy award easily. From facial expressions to Cillian Murphy's wide eyes that are capable of speaking without him having to say a word and how they also can express guilt, regret, sadness, confusion, and all sorts of feelings that Oppenheimer went through while completing the complex project of the atomic bomb. As well as, the support of the make up and hair design department, audience members are able to capture Oppenheimer in three different stages of his life, young version, middle aged version, and an older version of the character. After his role in The TV Show Peaky Blinders (2013 - 2022) as Thomas Shelby, his popularity grew and everyone sees him as Shelby. However, after watching this film, audience members will easily forget that and a new image will be created in everyone's head as him being Robert J Oppenheimer.Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss gives such a heavy and top tier acting role that his presence can be heavily felt on screen and in the events and the different stages that his character goes through. It is by far the second best acting role in the film after Cillian Murphy's, it is for Sure Oscar worthy for Best Supporting actor. Same thing will Cillian's image among fans, RDJ has the image of Tony Stark/ironMan in everyone's head. Everyone has gotten used to seeing him as that superhero who flies and shoots lasers from his hands. But, that image can e easily forgotten after watching this film. I am not denying every great thing he did for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man as I am a huge fan of it. But, this film reminds everyone of who RDJ really is as the actor who is able to portray and put on some great acting skills and Oscar worthy performance like he used to before as Harry Lockhart in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), Charles Chaplin in Chaplin (1992), or Paul Avery in Zodiac (2007).On the other hand, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves is the only role that added nothing to the table compared to everyone else's appearance. Even though he has a huge screen time and he plays an important role in the story, some other actors have less screen time than him and they did a better job. Like Rami Malek and Edward Teller.Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Rami Malek as David Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide throughout the whole film, do not have a scene that would put the spotlight on them and make them noticeable until we reach towards the end in which all of them will have their time, their moment, and their scene to shine which what made those scenes very special specifically because of their acting skills.In addition, there are so many other actors that appeared in the film (some are a surprise) in which they all have some great scenes and great acting skills that will lead them to shine in their scene and I will refuse to mention them to avoid any spoilers and it would rather be better if you walk into this movie not knowing that they will make an appearance.The film deals with sound effects in the most amazing way especially in moments of silence whenever the film focuses on Oppenheimer's point of view and what goes through his head in terms of fear, regret and confusion like heavy breathing, screams or countdowns.On the other hand, the film's sound mixing is horrible to the point that it may holdback a viewer's experience and understanding of the events of the film due to the struggle of hearing the dialogue. It's either their voice can hardly be heard, or the music at most times is louder than the speech. This is not a first time for a Nolan film as films like Tenet (2020) and The Dark Knight (2012) have a very similar issue in terms of hearing the speech.Not to mention that the Music score - that was louder than the speech at most times - is greatly composed by Ludwig Göransson who returns again with Nolan as he composed Tenet (2020) in which the similarities can be heard between both Tenet (2020) and Oppenheimer (2023). There is a specific tone and vibe that Ludwig Göransson used in both films to deliver the film in the way it should be. However, many have surprisingly compared Ludwig Göransson's work in Oppenheimer (2023) to Hans Zimmer's work in previous Nolan films like in Interstellar (2014) by specifically comparing Ludwig Göransson's music piece ""Can You Hear the Music"" in Oppenheimer to Hans' ""S. T. A. Y"" in Interstellar (2014). In my opinion, this is a totally unfair compression as Ludwig Göransson's work is nothing compared to Hans' work. That does not mean that Ludwig Göransson work is not that good but I just think that comparing what Hans Zimmer did lowers Hans' work quality as well as Ludwig Göransson's work.When promoting the film, it is suggested that seeing it in IMAX 70MM is A MUST which hyped everything as expectations has risen that audience members will probably experience something similar to Interstellar when it comes to the visuals and the cinematography. Yet, most of the film is literally being shot indoors with no room for visually stunning shots to even be introduced and present because the film depends on dialogues in the first place.But, does that mean that seeing in IMAX 70MM was NOT worth it? NO
Does that mean that I DON'T recommend everyone to go see it in IMAX 70MM (the format it is suppose to be seen in)? NO
Because, how often do film directors release films that are shot using IMAX cameras and are offered in IMAX 70MM (film IMAX and not digital IMAX)? It's probably once every 2-3 years. Therefore, I do highly recommend anyone to see it in IMAX 70MM FILM for the full experience and I promise it won't disappoint and the next time a film will be offered in IMAX 70MM will provably be in 2 or 3 years. But, I really was hoping and expecting an Interstellar or Avatar (2009), type of cinematography.The story of Robert J Oppenheimer isn't as complicated as how it is being introduced in this film. But, isn't the way that Nolan introduced and made this whole biography film different, unique and more complicated than other biography films, is what truly makes Nolan a unique film director?This is the first time that Nolan does a biography/based on a true story type of film and Im more than glad that HE did it, because I'm 100% positive that any other filmmaker would've turned it into an ordinary, usual and typical biography film without including any complications or mind blowing twists like Christopher Nolan.My rating is 9.5/10 (MIGHT CHANGE ON 2ND VIEWING)

The saddest part about the movie, was that you knew you're literally watching the reality in a movie:(
basically, it's about Robert Oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb and made it with the help of other scientists.NOTE: it's better to learn a little about history of world was II before starting to watch this. I decided to do that because in that case it was easier to imagine how was the situation back then.","

Oppenheimer," Excellent experience
",dierregi,26-Aug-23,"Finally a movie worth seeing, in the contemporary, desolate landscape. After the ""faux pas"" of Tenet, Nolan delivers again a great movie.Best parts
Murphy as Oppenheimer is just great. A multifaceted character, not the usual stereotypical patronising puppet. It's up to the audience to make up their mind about the man. Freedom is good, when most of contemporary storytelling steers you in one direction or elseThe non-linear storytelling keeps the attention going and it's not too difficult to follow. The star-studded cast delivers without anybody steeling the showI enjoyed the soundtrack, not too invasive but dramatic enough to underline the actionLess good
Just slightly overlong. After the testing in Los Alamos the plot slows down a bit and one does not really know what's supposed to happen to keep the story going.However, the last dialogue between Oppenheimer and Einstein is spot-on and the apt closure of a dramatic and all too realistic movie.","

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimer honest review
",Jojo-Xingyi,20-Aug-23,"Oppenheimer is a overall mediocre film. It depends too much on sound effects, and loud, sudden flashes as seen in the beginning, the only thing that makes the film engaging to the audience. There is a lot of unnecessary content, and is hard to understand even for Christopher Nolan standards. The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie. It would've been better for the film if the bombs were shown dropped in the beginning and have the story told in a reversed manner.","

Oppenheimer," late 1 hour for cinema screening? You won't miss anything
",tomzek,22-Jul-23,"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again.","

Oppenheimer," Phenomenal
",drewcallen,21-Jul-23,"This movie gets better the longer you think about it. Everything about the movie is so well done, especially Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of Oppenheimer as he realizes what he has done to humanity. The Trinity Test scene was perfectly well done, no horror movie has ever made my heart beat as much as that scene did. Seeing Strauss turn against Oppenheimer was super interesting (RDJ did amazing as him as well). The entire hearing act did a good job at showing how the different motives against Oppenheimer resulted in his downfall. The final scene of the movie is one of the most perfect scenes of any film i've ever seen. Strauss was trying to understand what Oppenheimer said to Einstein that day (assuming it was something to push Einstein against him), but it ended up being something so much more deep. The way the last scene was done was just so chilling and thought provoking, it will stick with you for days after watching it.","

Top notch acting by everyone and you will get to know the story of what Sir Julius Robert Oppenheimer had gone throughout the years (right from the recruitment for the project).

Oppenheimer," 2023's Most Devastating Movie!
",Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,06-Aug-23,"**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Oppenheimer is part-metaphysical film, part-courtroom drama, part-biopic, part-IMAX experience, all personal storytelling about one man who changed the history of the world. It's easily 2023's most important movie, but also its most devastating. It evokes the horrors of World War Two flawlessly even though we never see a single bullet flying on-screen (but don't think there's 100% clean imagery in this biopic). It gets down and dirty with Oppenheimer's life as an up-and-coming scientist changing the course of warfare itself (even if it was out of desperation to outpace the Nazis on the atom bomb front).Oppenheimer is a horror movie without any of the 'creeps and ghouls' gimmick; it's real-world history on The Manhattan Project, and that itself is never easy stuff to confront. It's 2023's defining World War Two film, and still relevant in regards to America's modern paranoia over Russia. At 3-hours it takes its time with all the personal, political and scientific stuff; and the sound design also helps make the experience feel 'atomic' and transcendent of the 'physical' story at play (especially the shots of the atoms themselves colliding and banging).Oppenheimer is a blockbuster that's not easygoing stuff by any stretch of the imagination, but it's certainly going to be remembered for generations to come thanks to Chris Nolan's spectacle and respect for J. Robert Oppenheimer himself.Oppenheimer leaves you feeling like... it says all it needs to say, yet it leaves you with dread that, did all this madness really end when The Manhattan Project itself ended? Did we end the world as we know it? The film implies... yes, we did.An uneasy experience but historically important and necessary for both cinema and history nuts alike. 5/5 stars. 10/10 IMDb points.","

Oppenheimer," Not Nolan's best but still worth a watch!!
",nadkarnisumeet,21-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer review :""I am become death; the destroyer of the worlds""; this particular Bhagvad Gita reference finds itself in the most unlikely moment in Christopher Nolan's latest cinematic spectacle called Oppenheimer, which is the name of the father of the atomic bomb. Knowing the genius of Nolan, he tells the the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer in his now patented ""non-linear""form with the all important Sanskrit phrase from the revered Hindu holy book forming part of a sex scene as well as the adrenaline rushing ""test"" of the atom bomb.The film is not just a simple biopic on the creator of the atom bomb but also a wonderful insight in to the political situation of the '40s, particularly the World War II. Oppenheimer is shown to be leftist inclined; an ideology which gets him embroiled in a litigation later. His relationship with his fellow scientists (particularly the great Albert Einstein) as well as his personal affairs with his wife (Emily Blunt) and girlfriend (Florence Pugh) are effectively shown.Quite verbose in its presentation with two parallel conversations leading to the climax, Oppenheimer is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, particularly if you are craving for just action and not dialogue heavy stuff. The actual bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki isn't shown as Nolan prefers concentrating on aftermath of the same. Oppenheimer's meeting with then POTUS Truman makes for a highly interesting scene. So is the climactic revelation about a certain crucial character.Technically, Nolan scores full marks yet again with an outstanding background score, awesome visual appeal and top notch production values expected from him.The cast is extraordinary and expectedly, Cillian Murphy delivers his best performance till date. Robert Downey Jr. Is the scene stealer as Lewis Strauss, the Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Matt Damon is also a standout as General Groves, the director of Manhattan Project. Rami Malek leaves a mark even in a cameo. The rest of the cast is also first rate.Oppenheimer may not match the level of Nolan's Inception (2010) or Interstellar (2014) but is way above the ordinary Hollywood stuff being served these days. Don't miss it in theatres!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.","

Oppenheimer," Too long but good movie.
",deloudelouvain,15-Jan-24,"Five Golden Globes for Oppenheimer, so that was the main reason I wanted to see it, to see what the fuzz is about. It's not a bad movie but personally I wouldn't have giving it any award. The cast was phenomenal, and by that I mean a lot of well known good actors and actresses, so nothing bad to say about the acting. I really like writer/director Christopher Nolan but Oppenheimer is certainly not better than Interstellar, Inception, The Prestige, Memento or Dunkirk for example. Three hours to tell Oppenheimer's story is just too long, especially when there is a lot of talking and debating and not a lot of action. The story is just dragged out and could have been told in two hours max. But yes it's a good movie, with a lot of good actors, it's just not award worthy as I've seen much better movies in that year.","

Oppenheimer," Not a single second wasted for a warning for eternity.
",charlieedmond,11-Nov-23,"It's no secret who Oppenheimer was and what his job was. The film seeks to expand on this and explore what his personal reflections were about his work and his job. It also explores those who sought to break down his public perception as a result of his personal views.You would think, how could a movie make this engaging whilst not coming across as verbose or boring, well, when you have a star studded cast and dialogue that feels like it was written as though humanity already lives on the Moon, you get a masterpiece such as this. Not once did I feel like it was too long, in fact, I wish it was slightly longer.This movie is visionary, it makes no attempt to ""ease"" the punches of reality, it is indifferent with regards to war. It looks at it exactly as it was with one primary question, ""What price are you prepared to pay to win the war and end all wars?"", and consequently, that price is what this movie ultimately explores, not just for Oppenheimer but for all the scientists along with him.And now, the world must live with that price too.","

Oppenheimer," The second watch is always best with Nolan (and skip the exhausting parts)
",mail-4230,05-Dec-23,"To walk on the shoulders of physic giants in the 20th century has always fascinated me. Those names: Heisenberg, Einstein, Bohr, Rutherford, Lawrence....as if they had invented the whole world within 2 decades! And those giants were made from human flesh! This is interesting, it really is.And then there is Oppenheimer, a difficult and complex character that was the bridge to open up the story from curious invention of some european physicists to the american nuclear bomb, the destroyer weapon of worlds. What he really added to physcics is unclear, except the he as the project manager of the Manhattan project. Let me be brief: 2 hours should have been the length. But Nolan was so close to the book it turned out to be 3 hours and it is so full of details, we cannot grasp it all. All is elaborate dialogue, which is exhausting. Did we need all the twists, every union protest, every hearing in the senate, every 3rd grade lab specialist scene to tell the whole story of Prometheus?Still, I can assure you that the best way to enjoy Oppenheimer is to watch the move a second time and just skip the useless parts and only enjoy the great scenes. Sounds crazy, but to me this is something typical to a Chris Nolan movie - the second time is better than the first time. What are the best scenes:Trinity Bomb ExplosionEdward Tellers statement for the jury (the respected arch enemy)The White House sceneRami Maleks statement to the jury (finally revenge)Einstein lake scene (especially the finale)Then there are all the other scenes which left me icecold the whole movie:
All the love scenes and affairs (Jean Tatlock) are just a cover. Did Nolan want to get the female audience involved? This film is ALL about men, it has little to do with women or family, really. I do not mean this is in a mean way, it is just not what is important to Oppenheimer.Robert Downey Jr. Character Schwartz is often boring. He tells us little, just a small bureaucrat (shoe salesman) that wants his career in the White House and is willing to go over Oppenheimers dead body for that. Of course this character is important, but do we need to see so much of him? And why is is not at all relatable?instead of showing some footage of the real drop of the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, there is a theatre scene with Oppenheimer as the speaker to state that Japan was a ""success"". The audience gets grilled by the nuclear flash to illustrate the drama of mass murdership. The audience will understand this trick, however I think one should have invested in the real tragedy and show parts of the real thing to make it more credible why Oppenheimer starts to develop his guilt complex. Like flashbacks. This was a bit too surreal to me.I leave it a this, but clearly this time Chris Nolan had no time to really reconsider if the movie should be really different from the book American Prometheus. There was no dramatic rewrite, instead he filmed every page. That did not help the audience.Despite that, I can only say that watching the whole movie has 2 genuine scenes, that make it all worthwhile:Gary Oldman is incredible as Truman. Just some sentences and suddenly all self questionaires about guilt are ridicolous with Oppenheimer. It was Trumans decision to drop the bombs, not Oppenheimers. Oppenheimer is confused if his decision to run the project was really that important or not. Could he have avoided the nuclear arms race that was to follow or the bomb drops on Japan? Truman says no, you are just a project leader on nuclear bombs, I run the show. But how he says that - fantastic!The finale with Einstein: As usual Einstein is presented as a loveable character. But it helps! When you see the Teddybear being shocked by what Oppenheimer says to him about the world burning, it is touching. When Einstein turns and walk away, It is as if the atheist Einstein finally is angry with god about the faith of mankind. In that respect, a Einstein movie that was serious would have been the more interesting protagonist.Maybe one has to watch the whole movie to feel the emotional rollercoaster that enfolds with these two scenes. Maybe not. As a film, Oppenheimer cannot compare to previous movies - maybe it would have been best to shoot a documentary instead.","

Oppenheimer," A challenging viewing experience, but powered by the performances.
",drawlife,31-Jul-23,"One of the most anticipated films of this year and who better to deliver the film none other than Christopher Nolan. Nolan makes the audience think, and I think for me at least it will click better with a second viewing much like DUNKIRK or TENENT. Nevertheless the shoulders of this film is carried by Cillian Murphy who finally gets to showcase his talents as a lead. He's always been a treat to watch on screen and I'm very happy for him. He deserves all the praise.Murphy channels Oppenheimer incredibly well. He acts with his eyes and his face. Throughout the film you're not in doubt with what he's thinking and what he's feeling as he never really expresses his feelings until the aftermath of his invention. Murphy effortlessly anchors the entire 3 hour film and it is a surefire Oscar nomination. He's consistently brilliant in almost anything he does and I think this film will put him on top of Everest.Robert Downey Jr. I think could potentially get an nomination as well. After an incredible decade of being Iron Man, he's able to show off his other talents reminiscent of his pre-Iron Man days. He disappears into the role of Lewis Strauss and he takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, patiently biding his time to strip Oppenheimer of his good reputation. To my surprise, Josh Harnett has a meaty role as Ernest Lawrence and it's nice to see him on screen again. Matt Damon brings his A-game as Major General Leslie Groves. He's a no-nonsense military character, but also rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. The unlikely alliance between the two is a treat to watch as Murphy and Damon have a good dynamic together.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh contribute to the story as his wife Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. To me I saw these two as a reminder of Oppenheimer's character flaws as he was not perfect. They represented something significant in Oppenheimer's life, Kitty being who he should be with, but Jean being someone he wants to be with. Also being that this is a Nolan film, no part is a small part, so there are a lot of incredibly talented and well recognized actors playing other historic figures and people of importance, so it was kind of fun to see who pops up as who for their glorified, but layered and important cameos.In true Nolan fashion, this isn't a conventional biopic. It's told in non-sequential order highlighting specific points in Oppenheimer's life jumping from places to places. For some this is the make or break for the film. I do think one has to be an experienced viewer of film to keep up with the non-linear storytelling, but again Nolan is very resourceful with the way he does this so it never really feels like you're too lost. I will admit though I do think I would have preferred something a little bit more conventional for my tastes. I liked the flow more when there were moments to marinate things happening in chronological order as opposed to jumping around and to Nolan's credit, he does this near the last hour or so. This is where I also felt the film is at its best when it focused on the psychological thriller aspect. There's one sequence in involving a speech that's particularly terrifying as you can feel Oppenheimer's horror and remorse. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments leading up to the completion of the bomb and when they begin to test it, it is very gripping when you don't expect it to be.Production design is incredible, the attention to detail is also impeccable. Kudos to production designer Ruth De Jong who also has experience in period pieces like THERE WILL BE BLOOD. Creating a look and feel to a time that's long gone may seem so simple and easy to do on the surface, but I cannot imagine the challenges the crew had to face, making sure everything was on point to that era. From costumes, buildings, set design, cars, etc. You feel transported to that time. It's also shot in a way that is also very immersive by Hoyte Van Hoytema, making this his fourth collaboration with Nolan. Music is composed by Ludwig Göransson, who also killed it with BLACK PANTHER and MANDALORIAN. He is definitely going to get some praise for his work here.This film almost touches on greatness, if it were not for it's length and time jumps. The movie is overly dense as it tries to bundle too much of Oppenheimer's pre and post-Trinity life into one movie. I also do think if you're a history buff it will be a more enjoyable experience, but for those who aren't too familiar with the subject, it is something that might be harder to digest with its first viewing. I do personally think somewhere in this film, there is a phenomenal 2.5 hour cut, but OPPENHEIMER is still a powerful biopic that explores and shows the dark side of human nature, powered by a tour-de-force performance from Cillian Murphy. Another landmark achievement from Christopher Nolan.8/10.","

Oppenheimer," Brilliant Performances, Brilliant Direction, but multiple viewings required
",talking_about_movies,24-Jul-23,"The much awaited historical entry from one of my favourite directors, Christopher Nolan, is finally out. It's being well received from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I can say it more or less deserves that reception.I did have the fear of not understanding this movie. Nolan has a habit of making his films as ground-breaking as possible. He doesn't want his movies to feel normal. He speeds up his storytelling and makes his dialogue scenes as brief as possible to keep the audience's brain working the whole time. So yes, in this film too, there are things that I missed. I understood the story, but I missed many character details that were thrown at me very fast in multiple different scenes. And I'm not sure whether this story even needed the non-linear way in which it was told here. You'll need multiple viewings to fully understand this film.Let's now talk about everything else. The story is available through various forms of media already. So I don't think anything new was written into this movie. What this movie had to do though, was to show this existing story. That it did - through brilliant direction, phenomenal performances, jaw-dropping soundtracks and the intensity that all of them brought to the story. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the psychological effects on Oppenheimer, and Nolan's vision made a scintillating combo. In fact there are so many brilliant performances here - Jason Clarke, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, all of them give some intense performances. Ludwig Goransson's score is just chilling (the composer of Black Panther). There are so many scenes here that just gave me goosebumps. There's a scene where Jason Clarke's character is arguing with Oppenheimer, and that entire scene was just amazingly performed and made by everyone. There's also the Trinity test scene which was brilliantly directed by Nolan. There are many such scenes.Overall I do think this is a great movie, but I'll definitely have to watch it again to believe that. It's great to see a historical drama be so successful at the theatres.Edit: Rewatched, and yes, I fully believe that this is a brilliant movie.","

Oppenheimer," Stunning, Thought-Provoking, Brilliant
",azmark1887,27-Dec-23,"Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a momentous achievement, an engrossing film stunning in its art direction, cinematography, musical score, and sound direction; rhetorically clear though its narrative is dense and circuitous at times, and successful in bringing to life the paradoxical achievements, complex personality, and flesh and blood humanity of one of the 20th century's most brilliant, driven, and controversial scientists.Through a non-linear story that moves forward despite numerous flashbacks and flashforwards over three hours, the film holds its center by using a tremendously talented ensemble cast of scientists, spouses, and bureaucrats to illustrate the race to beat Germany in developing a weapon that would end World War II.As Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) says to a young Oppenheimer, shown as a floundering graduate student in experimental physics at Cambridge University, you don't have to read the score if you can hear the music when encouraging the young scientist to not worry about his lack of skills in complex mathematics, the audience doesn't need to understand the equations of quantum physics to follow the story of a world-altering scientific achievement and the resulting political fallout.Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing as the egotistical, self-absorbed, ambitious yet compassionate, charming, and brooding genius who is troubled by visions of a universe governed by probabilities as much as physical laws, concerned with the plight of workers, intellectually curious well beyond his chosen field, and reckless and naïve in his romances and friendships. Supporting roles are well played by Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Alden Ehrenreich, Matt Damon, and a nearly unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr., who is superb in a supporting role.Expect numerous Oscar nominations and several wins for this latest project by writer/director Nolan who, perhaps more than any writer/director of his generation other than Denis Villeneuve, so skillfully melds 20th-century cinema staples of location, staging, costuming, music, photography, and great storytelling with 21st-century technology.","

",chris-fussel,29-Nov-23,"From the very beginning this movie pulls you in and you are left at the edge of your seat the entire 3 hours. First it doesn't feel like 3 hours all. Then the movie will stay with you for weeks afterwards. The timing for a movie like this is perfect as it has been said Sam Altman (the man mostly responsible for this revolution in AI we are all undoubtedly aware of) is a modern Oppenheimer in many ways. Not only this but I felt it was redemption for the man himself.I cannot recommend enough, due to the fact that many people have called this movie (boring) to read up on the manhattan project and J Robert Oppenheimer before watching. Read American Prometheus if you have the time or watch one of the many documentaries. It's worth doing as it enhances the experience even more. Consider the impact such a thing has had on the world. You do that and I just don't understand how anybody could possibly find this movie boring in any way.Cillian Murphy's performance is truly remarkable and he has earned his Oscar for this. In fact the entire cast really are at their best in this film. I thought I'd struggle watching Robert Downey Junior play anything other than Iron Man, let alone the bad guy in any film but he really nailed his role as Strauss. It should be mandatory viewing in my opinion for anyone and I truly cannot recommend this film enough. Christopher Nolan has never really disappointed and this is his masterpiece.

",trdatiii,05-Sep-23,"Most of the movie was enjoyable, it was very cool to see the Manhattan project and discover who Oppenheimer was. Also learning a bit about nuclear physics. Nevertheless, I do not get why they put a 15 minute sex scene with a gypsy looking lady that worships Ctuhlu. Apart from this it was really a drag at multiple points, they could have cut at least 30 minutes of uninteresting dialogue and material out of the film and give a more action packed experience. It really feels like the movie was lacking some proper cutting of some parts. Despite these flaws it was a good movie and probably one of the best recent releases.","

Oppenheimer," Calmly astounding
",AfricanBro,24-Jul-23,"In recent years, usually when a film has such a packed cast it often never met expectations so I didn't have many for this, I was confident it was gonna be good but refrained from gauging how good it could actually be. Quoting Greek mythology really set the tone for the rest of the movie. Christopher Nolan is known for blending some sci-fi to his more renowned movies; this is a history biopic but has a lot of elements resembling sci-fi. Building something that at the time period, could only be a pigment of one's imagination. The movie blends together mythology, physics, betrayal, history, philosophy, politics and moral conundrums... maybe this is recency bias but I think this is one of Christopher Nolan's best work.It doesn't climax how I expected it, and in the end, even though the movie heavily involves the Word War and is heavily influenced by war drama, more so US's bombing of Japan, the bomb itself isn't the main focus of the story, although I felt that the movie was leading us there for the first half. There's a lot more to the story and that can be seen as there's still a good chunk of runtime left after the bombing. Everything before that moment, which was a lot, seemed like it was there to help understand Oppenheimer more and the moral dilemmas he faced and how it changed him. I really lost track of time, but before what I think is the last hour of the movie, I thought the movie was about Oppenheimer's bomb, but by the end of the movie you go back to remembering it's a biopic on Oppenheimer himself. An excellent one at that, that almost out any other biopic to shame in my recent memory.The story is told from Oppenheimer perspective, well the colored scenes not the black and white ones which were impartial. We get to see him plagued by guilt and internal turmoil he faced about his betrayal; which was a reoccurring theme throughout the movie, not just to/from Oppenheimer but so many in the film. Mostly about dealing with the consequences of his success, as he's haunted by visions of an apocalypse he helped orchestrate. He started out lost in his youth, but lively at the start of his teaching and Manhattan project, but goes to a dark place after failing to justify his achievement wit the bomb, the nazi threat.The acting was superb all around, and while cillian Murphy stood out, the rest of the star studded cast performances are noticeable. All the main characters had enough screen time to not be overshadowed. Tom Conti was a standout as he used his very limited time as Albert Einstein to great use; I also loved that his and Oppenheimer's story arcs had similar endings. Robert Downey Jnr also does a splendid job, his role takes a turn, somewhat shocking as the movie mainly revolves around the manhattan's projects A-bomb creation that we don't get huge insight into his and Oppenheimer's relationship, only glimpses that you only put together at the end. Casey's Affleck's role was so secretive, he didn't have as much of a pivotal role as a I expected. Emily blunt and Florence Pugh were splendid every scene they were in. I couldn't shake that Emily Blunt's role reminded me of her in The English though, as they were set in similar surroundings. Matt Damon was also good here. Cillian Murphy has had spectacular roles in the past, most notably as Thomas Shelby of which I didn't think he could outdo, but this is probably his career defining performance to date. The cast depth is insane.There are a lot of dark themes explored in depth, so it's a little shocking we don't get to see much of Japan, it's almost glossed over once it's done. But that could be due to us watching from Oppenheimer's standpoint and how he experienced these events. The countdown was epic and suspenseful even though you know knew it was coming. It might be a story you already know from history but Nolan and his cast managed to a create a wonderful character study that submerged you into his story.The music score was great too, helping convey the emotions each scene demanded. I was also surprised by how serene the movie was, while still keeping the thrill of a war drama. How tense and calm the aura of the film was even with a bomb going off.In the end I think it's a perfect biopic, a cinematic masterpiece were we got to see all sides of Oppenheimer, however conflicting and the cast and Nolan did an amazing job depicting his life. It's a perfect movie; the cinematography, the cast, the writing, the score... what else could you ask for.","

Oppenheimer," Swing and a miss...
",jmcd2007,05-Aug-23,"Nolan did a great job hiding some extended details of this film on the trailers because I did not expect to see some of what I saw during the film itself. The film itself came off as kind of boring. The odd nude scenes and sex scenes also came off as crude and unnecessary. Some scenes like what was mentioned repeat or become redundant throughout the film. The film focused too much on Oppenheimer's politics and not enough on the man himself. I'm not a fan of any film that makes politics one of the primary themes. I knew that Oppenheimer had political leanings, but did not expect Nolan to go this deep into that part of his life.Footage of the climatic atomic bomb explosion seemed to have been kept to a bare minimum. His wife became a depressed and angry mess of a character as the film progressed. Oppenheimer himself exhibited some troubling behavior, as when he was speaking to a crowd, he was imagining a bomb going off as movie goers were greeted with grotesque imagery of people's faces literally being melted off. In summary, this is not a film that I would recommend seeing again.","

Oppenheimer," I am Become the Elephant in the Room
",wolfghostninja,14-Feb-24,"Nolan has made some exceptional films and is without a doubt a technical master, but he's also made some lousy films too. Have been a Nolan fan since Following, and was very excited to see Memento and The Prestige, both of which are in my personal favourites of all time. But, as his films became more mainstream they have also grown weaker, and Oppenheimer continues that trend.Nolan leans heavily on music, since he believes that films should be seen in the cinema, but for whatever reason dialogue is often difficult to hear or understand properly, and I know I am not alone in that complaint. It becomes so bad that one begins to wonder whether he is papering over the cracks, or that he lacks confidence in the story being told, either way, I did not enjoy this film and frequently hoped it would end soon.Structurally, there's no film here, theres no timeline, and it jumps from future to past and back again. The music is manipulative, trying to invent tension, but there is nothing really there other than a jumbled loud mess.There are no characters, and perhaps that is the idea, the film studiously shys away from the subject matter of a nuclear bomb and it is and what it does, and perhaps should have been retitled ""I am become the Elephant in the Room"". It's shallow filmmaking, as the core subject matter is basically ignored. A similar result was achieved in Dunkirk, a WW2 film that couldn't acknowledge the fact that war isn't a PG12 experience.I like Nolans willingness to invent, to push boundaries, but his work has become 1 step forward and two steps back. I won't disrespect his work by calling it cowardly, but the thought has crossed my mind. 4 on 10.","

Oppenheimer," A Visually Stunning and Emotionally Captivating Journey into History
",mukukachanda,07-Aug-23,"In his latest masterpiece, Christopher Nolan brings the life of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen with exceptional performances from an ensemble cast. Through astounding visual effects and practical in-camera techniques, Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that immerses viewers into Oppenheimer's world. While requiring multiple viewings to grasp its nuances, Oppenheimer remains a must-watch for cinephiles who appreciate the artistry behind filmmaking. With a perfect balance between hero and villain, the characterization of Oppenheimer tugs at the audience's emotions, leaving them invested throughout the three-hour journey. Despite minor sound mix issues, Nolan's exploration of history and science makes Oppenheimer a thought-provoking and visually spectacular cinematic delight. 🎬","

Oppenheimer," Intense, another Nolan classic but very different
",Christopher_Reid,22-Jul-23,"I don't know where to begin. This movie was just so intense. Like every Nolan movie, it has completely enveloped my mind. I'm obsessed with it. It's haunting me.In many ways, it's a big departure for Nolan. Normally his movies have a lot of action, crazy stunts, far out sci-fi plots and most of them are fictional. Even Memento had more action and violence than this. Dunkirk was based on real events in WWII but it barely had any dialogue and was more of an experience, an action/suspense/thriller ride.Oppenheimer truly is a biopic, all about a man and his life. It doesn't try so much to give an objective overall assessment. It feels very personal. It captures the intensity of life. When you reflect over your years and realise the big things which stay with you. Other movies feel so trivial compared to this.The acting is incredible, one of the most impressive casts of all time, mostly male but that's a reflection of the reality. Cillian is great. So many understated and incredibly talented actors seem to come from the UK and Ireland. Oldman is great as well in his brief role - when I saw him, I thought ""of course, who else could play a role like this and pull it off"". He's so good at accents and embodying people.Branagh, Blunt, Downey Jr., the sister from Black Widow, Hartnett, Raiden from Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (a personal highlight) - they're all perfectly cast. Not to mention perhaps 10 to 15 other great performances from other actors. It makes me so keen to learn more about the real people and get back into physics. I miss my university years. Also the aging effects are flawless, for lack of a better word.The music is really effective. I correctly guessed it was Ludwig Goransson again (Tenet), who kind of replaced Hans Zimmer who was busy doing Dune. I really enjoyed it. It felt like an extension of some of those themes. Often heavy in intense, but also contemplative and... intellectual I suppose?I'm now intrigued by Oppenheimer. By being so specific in the details of his life, the movie becomes universal. We might not achieve the same things, have the same fears or make the same mistakes, but we can relate to his emotions and experiences. It's all analogous. And few movies touch on life like this.The pace is blistering. Nolan is great at drawing you in, directing your attention, building to climaxes, using parallel timelines to enhance the meaning and suspense of various events. Now the movie is over, I'm left desperate for more. It's 3 hours long, and it certainly felt long, but it was riveting for that length.I personally have mixed feelings about Oppenheimer's politics. Teachers shouldn't be political in front of students. It's not the right venue. And communism was dangerous, not that different from fascism - just different names for insane, incoherent visions which overrule personal freedom and lead to totalitarianism. But the paranoia surrounding communism and treatment of Oppie was probably unwarranted and unhelpful.The bombing of Japan was necessary. Few alternatives existed at the time. Maybe that could have been emphasised more. But this is a movie and its Oppie's movie. He seems like he was a very intelligent and caring man. His fears are still relevant today. I think deterrents work and it's good that the US has the most nuclear weapons in the world. But it's still scary. What if such weapons get in the wrong hands? We're in a new world.Overall, this movie was highly engaging considering it's 95% talking. It's powerful, memorable and thought-provoking. It doesn't try to go into the scientific details, just what we need to know. It doesn't pander with cliches.It's full of important interactions, just as our lives are. It seems to rush through them. We're left with all these fragments as we try to piece them together. All the standard emotions are there - happiness, sadness, anger, betrayal, redemption, hope, fear, etc.I can't wait to learn more about the real events and watch this again in 6 months or a year. Until then, it's making me reflect on my life and, like very few movies (including Schindler's List and E. T.), it reminds me of the immense weight of life itself. How profound it is.","

Oppenheimer," A Cinematographers Wet Dream
",NormalGuyReviews,25-Nov-23,"THE VISUALS
Firstly, yes, I saw it in IMAX and yes it was worth it literally stripping everything else away. This is a visual masterpiece and the three hour run time left me wanting more. If you're like me, or are even remotely interested in cinematography or effects design, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.THE STORY
I'll admit I fell pray to the same idea as everyone else hoping that there would be more about the bomb and less about the personal life of Oppenheimer but the movie is titled Oppenheimer for a reason I was not disappointed by this but any history nerd would've liked a little more screen time for the bomb. I found the pace very acceptable not too slow, and the cuts between black and white and color, I felt were a good way to represent the timelines and points of view of the characters. Some people had an issue with this, but I felt like it tied everything together instead of split things apart.THE ACTING
(Having not known Oppenheimer personally) like some seem to complain like they did I can't say how accurate Cillian's performance was, but for me, it felt spot on. I think he was tailor made for this role.MAtT dAmON
It's not that he did a bad job. I just feel like there could've been a lot of better options to play general Leslie Groves. I was a little distracted from his character because it felt like he was trying to be something that wasn't Leslie Groves. I know it's a movie and historical accuracy can only go so far in Hollywood but I just kept asking myself why Matt Damon?ALL IN ALL
If you like history, if you like Christopher Nolan, if you like cinematography, see the movie, you won't regret it.","

You exceeded my already very high expectations - I've been anticipating this film for over six months. Thank you for choosing a fantastic cast to present such a masterpiece. The visual and auditory experience is something I want to experience again, particularly when it's still available in the premium cinemas.I went with a friend that told me they prefer movies to only be about 100 minutes long as he can get fidgety. I am grateful to say that they said that the 3 hours was very enjoyable and didn't feel long at all. In contrast, I admit I was disappointed it wasn't longer :-) but maybe I'm odd in that when I'm watching a great film then I'm happy for it to continue.Do yourself a favor, watch the movie at least once, ideally in a good cinema or at least a way to try to experience the audio and video as best you can.","

I thought the acting was amazing and felt no one did a bad job portraying their characters. I'm glad I was given an insight of the type of person Oppenheimer was and how he conducted himself during and after the project; may he rest in peace.","

When it's a given.Nolan also goes back to all his typical tricks - jumping around the timeline, 1-dimensional women, needless nudity, and an overbearing soundtrack. Showing he has not grown as a Director/Writer at all.Cillian Murphy seemed to struggle in the role, he comes across as very bored and his character doesn't feel like a genus at any part of the film.A lot of the big names take you out of the film, but all the other scientists in smaller roles played their parts well.It's an ok film, but they should've focused on making the bomb, like the trailer implies.","

",maddmaxx46,04-Feb-24,"What a masterpiece. It's very long with tons of exposition so it demands your full attention, but the payoff is well worth it. The first half can be tough to get through but it's essential so it can set up for an astounding second half. Nolan did a fantastic job. I will need to sit on this one to rank it properly in his list of directed movies but it's not out of the question to slot it in the top three. The score was brilliant. Very loud compared to most films but I appreciate how much attention he can draw to that aspect of the movie. Acting was also phenomenal with Murphy and Downey Jr. Doing a fantastic job.

",fb6ins1z1,01-Aug-23,"This is the second film of Nolan's I have watched that features historical events and characters. For such a monumental slice of human history, this movie fails to emphasize the most important bits. It most certainly did not scratch the itch that I had developed when I found out it existed!Nolan works wonders when he handles original ideas and Batman films. However, I have been disappointed too many times by him forcing originality into things that people are already familiar with.Chris, sometimes we just want to see historical events visualized outside the documentary format. You don't need to try to prove how intelligent you are in every movie you make... You're butchering history just like Netflix does. Just, in a different way... I'm just disappointed that this wasted opportunity will now discourage others from making an Oppenheimer/Manhattan Project movie because it will have been already made. Or has it?","

Those who adore all he touches, will needless to say tell you that this is the Greatest Movie of All Time, Oscar Certainty, etc. Etc.The truth? It's not his best film. He's got to that point in movie making when he BADLY needs an independent editor. This could have been a MUCH better film if it was 2 hours long instead of 3.The problem is that it's over-blown with portentous jump-cuts and crashing intrusive music attempting to fill the void of ... well not an awful lot actually going on. I'm afraid Nolan has become lost in his own hype and no longer knows how to make a dramatic movie.It's always an interesting lesson to stitch back these multiples time zone movies into one sequence and ask whether they are actually any good without the magician's sleight of hand? Try it with Pulp Fiction or Memento. If a movie is only good because it flicks back and forth, it ain't actually very good at all.And that's Oppenheimer. A giant bloated, over-rated, over-hyped, mess of a movie.Good acting though.","

Oppenheimer," Intelligent dialogue, intricate flashes forward/back. Downside: overlong on explosions and imagined atom interaction
",adrianovasconcelos,22-Jul-23,"Director Christopher Nolan has to be praised for coming up with another very good film, after THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, TENET and others. He connects technology with the human mind more successfully than any other director I can think of these days.That said, OPPENHEIMER suffers from the same overlength problem that had already hurt INCEPTION: Mr. Nolan seems to like 3-hour long movies.Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema rates extremely high order, the same going for art direction and editing.Acting also deserves praise across the board, even if I felt that Matthew Modine, Anton Kushner and a few other well known actors had to accept largely insignificant, tiny roles just to be part of a prestigious production.The male lead, Cillian Murphy, will probably get Best Actor awards next year. He plays the Hamlet-like figure of J. (a letter that stands for nothing, he admits) Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist/scientist who goes to England, Germany, Austria and other places where WWII would rage soon after, and he sees several women with different kinds of affection and a general distance that he also keeps in relation to communism and politics, prompted to a large extent by his consuming interest in quantum mechanics, and later in the Los Alamos Project, the H and atomic bombs, and above all the human resourcing around the entire project.Murphy looks much older than he does in real life, mirroring the sucked in facial structure of the real Oppenheimer, almost like the face of death. He is on screen most of the time and delivers a top notch performance that reflects his Jewish background and how he senses the danger of Hitler's rise to power and Nazi domination. He brims with intelligence, a scientist's mental abstraction, a remoteness reflected in his relationship with his children (never on his mind, he even asks Chevalier, who he is cuckolding with the lovely Britt Kyle, to keep his oldest child for a while), and the difficulty of steering the course at the helm of a project buffeted by so many contrasting and shifting interests, right up to President Truman's, and including the ignominiously vindictive Lewis Strauss, superbly played by Robert Downey, who also looks much older than in real life, and who came to be viewed as the villain in the AEC proceedings that saw Oppenheimer lose his security clearance.Emily Blunt shines as Oppenheimer's ignored, betrayed wife, who has to look after the children and do house chores while hubby engages in his scientific quests. She encourages him to continue his work even when he feels dejected by the politics surrounding his overwhelming assignment, and urges him to fight to clear his name instead of adopting the Hamletian posture that he seems unable to drop. In the end, she symbolizes the defender and guarantor of the values in the Constitution, even if they get trampled by the military wanting a bomb at all costs and quickly to end the war with Japan, presidential design, and all manner of envy that is typical of such high-powered jobs and duties.I would have liked the film to explain more clearly the importance of dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to beat Russian plans to take Japan, besides the obvious desire to reduce human casualties caused by war, even if at the cost of millions of Japanese lives, and for several generations.OPPENHEIMER offers some insight into pre-, war, and postwar times though, inevitably, history and the actual truth may not have survived unscathed.To conclude, I liked it very much, found it gripping throughout. 8/10.","

Oppenheimer," A Landmark Movie
",varun-25071997,21-Jul-23,"To make a movie of this standard on a 100 million dollar budget is a significant achievement by a modern filmmaker. For 180 minutes, Oppenheimer narrates a single story and opens up multiple themes like a flower blooming. It is vivid but not obvious, there lies the success of the movie.Nolan follows the same narrative style of Dunkirk, he doesn't show the enemy or the victims but makes us understand the horror through mere sound and imaginations. It is often said that ghosts are scary when they are felt more than they are seen and Nolan attests this statement. The movie goes back and forth with flashbacks in a nonlinear narrative structure, the trademark Nolan style at thos point. But this time the story is connected by a clear set of dots.The Manhattan Project is a very tough story to sell in the commercial space without compromising anti-war and nuclear disarment ideals. To blend in commercial elements in a politically significant storyline is no easy task today and this is the biggest success of Oppenheimer. The movie doesn't read like a Wikipedia page and doesn't use excess prosthetics for the sake of ""transformation"". The actors are well talented in this ensemble and there is a clear trust for their style.While Cilian Murphy is undoubtedly the star of the show, it was Robert Downey Jr who gets the best role of his career. For years he was underutilized in the performance department and was purely used as a mould for the MCU, it is refreshing to see him unleash his acting prowess. While the technical departments are getting their rightful praise, it is the makeup and hairstyling which caught my eye here. Impressive and simple work to create aging, which many fail to grasp.","

Oppenheimer," Cillian finally gets what he deserves
",khaledmohamedaboelezz,27-Jul-23,"Murphy is an exceptional actor, in the movie he was amazing and helped the actors with him to do their best, The sound effects of the movie is one of the best of all time especially in I-MAX theater, the bombing scene was masterpiece, and of course we know that bombing scene was masterpiece, but the closure scene! Oppenheimer talking to Einstein about the chain reaction they thought it will happen when bombing the nuclear bomb and cause the burning of atmosphere and all the world with it this of course didn't happen, but Oppenheimer realized that he already started it inventing the nuclear bomb knowing that all countries will race to have as many nuclear bomb and even advanced on as they can, and imagining that someday they will start a nuclear war that will destroy all the world. This is a scene that i think i'll never forget for all my lifetime
Overall the film is perfection, everyone did his job in perfect way, and i think cillian finally can has his Oscar award.","

Oppenheimer," H-Bomb Creator or World Destroyer?
",AaronCapenBanner,23-Nov-23,"Christopher Nolan both writes and directs this ambitious, visually stunning, superbly acted film about the real-life physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy who uncannily does resemble the man) who is recruited by the United States to use his brilliant Quantum mechanical theory and skill to design and build the first atomic bomb, despite some ethical doubts about the innocent civilians to be killed upon the detonation, and the long-term consequences of such powerful technology in the wrong hands, and the possibility of a chain reaction leading to world destruction...Sprawling 3-hour epic is another triumph for Nolan, taking a potentially dry subject matter and making it both mesmerizing storytelling and fascinating character drama, not just about him but the many people in his orbit whose lives are impacted both personally and professionally, as his brilliant mind is indeed all too human at heart.","

The performances from the whole cast is outstanding every actor and actress deserves an Oscar. Especially Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer, he is so and committed to the role. Another stand out performance is Robert Downey Junior, it shows that he's not just iron man. The dialogue is so gripping and you feel so invested in the story that is being told. The scene when they actually detonate the bomb was spectacular. The way the film ends leaves you walking out scared of the world we live in.","

Oppenheimer," A Fantastic Film
",mahmus,24-Jul-23,"It wasn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping for, but Oppenheimer is still a really fantastic movie.Cillian Murphy is terrific and the supporting cast is honestly insane. This might beat The Thin Red Line for the amount of big name actors that show up. Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show. I did feel like Emily Blunt was a bit wasted though. She has one really good scene, but she's mostly just the ""wife"" character.The cinematography, editing, music; it's all top-notch, even if most of the visuals don't really make it a ""must see in IMAX"" movie. The detonation sequence is absolutely breathtaking though.It did start to feel a bit overdramatic at points, with plot twists and lots of shouting courtesy of Jason Clarke's almost cartoonishly evil character. Plus there are times where (despite it's uniquely Nolan structure) it does feel like a rather standard biopic, especially in the first act. That feeling doesn't stick for very long though since the whole thing is so well put together.In the end, I would say this is easily one of my favorite Nolan films. It's great to see him tap into more emotional themes, even when there are still some issues. Also, I absolutely loved the ending.","

Oppenheimer," Good film - Maybe someday I'll regain my hearing
",SDAim2,26-Jul-23,"Well, Oppy is quite an experience. In many ways it's an amazing film, BUT... it's stubbornly nonlinear, as if someone shuffled the storyboards. And somewhat impressionistic. I think Nolan was trying to capture in visuals both the psychological noise of that super-secret project and the zeitgeist of that pressure-packed era - without abandoning the narrative. At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs. It really helps if you know the arc of Oppenheimer's story, or at least the moral ambiguity that tempered the scientific deadline to develop a device that ""could"" end life on earth.Caveat: if you're taking your dad, and he just got a pacemaker, bring ear plugs for him. Nolan and his sound designer play audio pranks throughout the film, following a quiet or silent passage with sudden deafening sound.","

Oppenheimer," Destroyer of Worlds
",aciessi,23-Jul-23,"Here is what you need to know. Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the decade. This is a film you must see, regardless of whether or not you watch a lot of movies. See it on the biggest IMAX screen you can. It is as much an engrossing document of vital history as it is an unparalleled sensory experience. This film is of course about the invention of nuclear weaponry, and of course, you'll get up close and personal to a real detonation. But that's nowhere near the thrill behind Oppenheimer. In fact, there isn't supposed to be one. Oppenheimer is a blistering indictment of the bomb's creation and a passionate anti-war plea. What's more, is that this is a masterful character study about the man behind the bomb, and the agonizing regret he felt about creating it in the first place.J. Robert Oppenheimer was a curious physicist who in one lifetime received the ultimate praise and the ultimate ire from the nation he belonged to. Summoned by the U. S. military, he served as the brains behind the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first, second and only atomic bombs ever used in battle. For that moment, Oppenheimer brought about the brutal end of a world war, but that was exactly the problem. A brutal end to a brutal war, and forever, the world had changed. Oppenheimer gave birth to the first weapon of mass destruction, and every nation on earth wanted one of their own. The arms race was on. The end of the world, suddenly, a possibility. If that weren't enough already, his greatest scientific ally betrays him in a stunning act of jealousy and personal enrichment, leading to a demoralizing persecution at the hands of the U. S. Government at the height of the red scare.Oppenheimer becomes the physical manifestation of guilt and yes, death. Wracked with unending pain, we see his body begin to consume itself. His eyes stare straight into the abyss. His frame, gaunt and emaciated. Always seemingly on the verge of tears. Cillian Murphy delivers an unforgettable performance that I struggle to think won't land him an Oscar next year. For three hours, Murphy is spellbinding, and that is incredible given the fact that for the most part, he is simply talking with other people. Oppenheimer, by that affect, is not a laborious chore to sit through, but instead, a living and breathing historical account. Robert Downey Jr., as the backstabbing Lewis Strauss is instantly the clear front runner for Best Supporting Actor in a performance that mirrors F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus.Oppenheimer is many great movies in one, and for Christopher Nolan, that comes with so much ease. In every aspect, he approaches the material with the gravity it deserves and not once does it meander and and lose focus of the core information behind the story. That unto itself is a tremendous undertaking, and without a doubt, Nolan passes that test.","

Oppenheimer," Very Good; Technically Great, but Emotionally Lands Just Short of a Classic
",HarCarmichael,03-Aug-23,"Acting was about as perfect as you can get from the leads, directing was at times brilliant and other times superfluous, editing was timejumpy but made it compelling, seeing Einy was magical, ending was solid, writing was dialogue driven, the best scene was addressing the audience after the event.This is Nolan's most realistic movie, and it is pure Oscar bait. It has a real shot at winning him Best Picture, which would be shocking with the way he's been mostly unaccepted when it comes to awards season.However, as much as I thought it was a very good watch, brilliant at times, a good movie, and interesting, I also felt like it was a little bit too long and focused a little bit too much time on Strauss, when it could have been wrestling with Oppenheimer's moral dilemma or contained a shocking twist of some kind, even if it meant using creative liberties and stretching or embellishing the truth.The Strauss twist just didn't land emotionally or powerfully for the script, even though it was true. And therein lies the biggest weakness of the film- because it's a true story, it plays out like a documentary with little cinematic umph at its climactic moments, but Nolan does better than anyone else could've done with the material to turn it into compelling cinema.Technically, it's great-10/10, but experientially, it lands a little shy from being a true classic. However, I prefer this kind of grounded Nolan like with Memento and The Dark Knight than his overly ambitious sci fi thrillers because they are more relatable to real life. This is one of those one-watch technical gems that get high ratings, but most people would probably never sit through again unless it was for a school history class.7.5/10.","

Oppenheimer," Too many long stretches with no stakes
",ojford,19-Aug-23,"The reason this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece is because 3-hour biopics are rarely successful at the box office - after years of superhero dominance, critics understandably want to promote something different.Unfortunately the film itself is disappointing. There are too many long stretches spent in committee rooms discussing things, the significance of which is never explained. It's never clear why it matters if Oppenheimer's clearance is revoked. It's never clear how the Senate denying Strauss a cabinet position makes any difference. Nolan tries to make us care with loud dramatic music, but that's no substitute for a compelling narrative.The forward story, chronicling Oppenheimer's rise from clumsy physics student to leader of the Manhattan Project and father of the atom bomb, is better. It's told as an extended movie trailer, in a series of vignettes which fits its portrayal of a brilliant polymath who thinks at the speed of light.However, even this section doesn't quite give us a good understanding of the man. He's first presented as an absent-minded professor, who relies on theory over practice. Then, when he's asked to lead the Project, he's suddenly thinking about building a city in the desert, concerned about the living quarters for the scientists' families. We don't get a definite personality, just a brief overview of his achievements and personal relationships, told out of order.It's not a bad film. It has some stunning sequences and many of the best actors working today. But compared to say Dr Strangelove, it's less effective in warning of the dangers of nuclear war. And compared to say A Beautiful Mind, it's shallower in presenting a brilliant scientist.","

Oppenheimer," A great film
",dmasursky,05-Sep-23,"I had originally thought this was a flawless film but upon reflection, I changed my mind. It is a magnificient film, with a splendid cast. It makes the science interesting and understandable (which could not have been easy) and it doesn't avoid the provocative politics of the situation. My complaint is that the audience does not necessarily understand why Oppenheimer is so arrogant and so celebrated. The film opens by showing how insecure and troubled he was, and then jumps ahead to the Manhattan Project without showing how he came to be so admired and so impressed with himself. It also shows many contenious relationships he had, leaving one to wonder why the Project scientists supported him decades later despite their dismay over the use of the bombs. I would have liked just a bit more showing his intellectual growth in his earlier years as well as his management of the Project. (I supposed I should read the book.)","

Oppenheimer," Everything about Oppenheimer
",briancham1994,01-Jan-24,"Oppenheimer is a rare sort of biopic that doesn't cut down the characters and events down to a single focused narrative. Instead, it covers just about everything about him - the development of the atomic bomb, the moral qualms about dropping it on Japan, his relationships, his post-war activism, his security clearance ""trial"" and more. It's a dizzying montage of events that skip from time period to time period with an incredibly fast pace but it works due to a clear subjective thread and deft editing. Due to this comprehensive scope, there's too much to comment on, but the acting and editing deserve the most praise. The main criticisms I have are that there's nothing in the film that warrants an IMAX viewing and the flags are historically inaccurate.","

",DanTheMan2150AD,21-Jul-23,"Oppenheimer is something else entirely and what makes it so fascinating is that it's so hard to distinguish what it really is. Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig Göransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty.","

Oppenheimer," Oppenheimer is a uniquely intriguing and infinitely compelling Cinematic Experience.
",Ed-from-HI,22-Jul-23,"'Oppenheimer' is a uniquely intriguing cinematic experience. It feels strangely-miraculous the way Christopher Nolan was able to take-on such complicated and even controversial subject matter and transform it into an intensely absorbing narrative intricately spiced with spectacularly imaginative visuals. Based on the over 700 page award winning biography 'American Prometheus' by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I have read multiple times-over, since it's 2005 publication). The story of how J. Robert Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project to create the first atomic bombs (before the Axis powers could ever figure it out), later valiantly attempting to limit the probabilities of world-wide Earth-shattering nuclear holocaust.... eventually having his intimate family-life and professional reputation severely disrupted and indelibly injured by the torrent of irrational McCarthyist paranoia sweeping the early 1950's - makes for fascinating material indeed but also an extremely daunting endeavor to capture coherently & compellingly on film due to the sheer complexity of subject matter along with the perplexingly enigmatic nature of the man along with the cruelly-chaotic circumstances of his times. It most definitely feels like only a Top-tier exceedingly gifted writer/Director like Christopher Nolan possessed the artistic vision and innovative resourcefulness to truly bring 'Oppenheimer' to cinematic 'Life' (another critical-factor being Christopher Nolan's inspired choices for matching the very finest actors to their 'perfect' spot-on roles).Cillian Murphy especially projects the otherworldly-luminous intelligence of Oppenheimer and perhaps even more importantly transmits the disquieting feeling that 'Oppie' actually possessed the uncanny awareness (which eventually became disillusioning burden) that he was carrying the weight of the entire World on his shoulders trying to control unremitting nuclear proliferation - not always knowing how to effectively navigate the dark-matter realm of political persuasion. The key to Cillian's emotionally resonant performance is that he evokes tremendous poignancy, communicating agonizing internal-conflict and deep reflection even in the many moments when there is little to no dialog (often thru facial expression alone). Robert Downey Jr. Provides a masterclass thru his complex portrayal of Oppenheimer chief adversary Lewis Strauss - making Strauss a character harboring layers of resentment well-concealed, and it takes practically the entire movie before the audience becomes fully-aware of the manipulative nature of Struss's master-plan to bring Oppenheimer down a few notches.... things ironically come full circle for Strauss which brings a small bit of 'closure' towards finale but Downey Jr.'s performance is so subtle and multi-layered making the Strauss character always fascinating and extremely watchable every time he appears on screen.Emily Blunt is also extremely watchable as Kitty Oppenheimer, J. Robert's formerly 'radical' wife who was a tragic and tormented (and often alcoholic) figure in real life..... but Emily Blunt's portrayal goes a long-way toward 'humanizing' Kitty often showing how fiercely protective she was of J. Robert when the walls were closing in on him. I actually wish there were many more scenes with Kitty because it feels like she often gets 'short-shrift' in the many Oppenheimer biographies I have read, but Emily Blunt's intriguing and humane performance seems to shed new light on the authentic character of Kitty which is refreshing.Matt Damon is sufficiently 'commanding' as General Leslie Groves, the scenes between Groves and Oppenheimer are some of the best in the entire film. The real General Groves was quite a visionary (and somewhat of an authentic genius himself) for choosing Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project in the first place (Groves intuitively understood that only Oppenheimer could effectively cultivate maximum cooperation & optimal creativity from all the eccentric scientific prodigies involved) Groves also fiercely stood by Oppenheimer thru the entire WWII years and it was really the Groves/Oppenheimer professional partnership that guaranteed America would be the first to Unlock and unleash atomic power - Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy authentically transmit this pragmatic professional bond perfectly!Another standout performance is Florence Pugh as un-reformed radical Jean Tatlock who might have been Oppenheimer's truest love but was also an extremely emotionally-fragile Soul who inadvertently brought indelible torment to J. Robert's life (and his relationship with Jean was probably one of the critical detrimental factors in the loss of Security-Clearance due to Jean's lingering radical history and Oppenheimer's lingering love for her). Finally Benny Safdie's portrayal of erratically-brilliant but self-serving Edward Teller (one of Hungary's ultra-brilliant 'Martians of Science' along with top Martian Jon Von Neumann of course) as another essential antagonist (alongside Strauss) although Teller's redeeming quality was that he was a certified 'genius' in terms of innovative scientific creativity, but he also played a crucial role in adding the final nail to Oppenheimer's 'loss of clearance' coffin, but it definitely feels like Oppenheimer and Teller did (at least in the beginning) harbor a mutual respect for each other's scientific 'gifts' which is exhibited on-screen so Safdie/Teller's film presence is always compelling.Overall, I agree that Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a major Cinematic achievement that ensures him a place in the Top-tier of All-time finest movie Director's (alongside Kubrick et al) not only from a creatively artistic standpoint but from his sheer force-of-will and persistence to even get an immensely challenging project like 'Oppenheimer' financed, off the ground and on to those IMAX 65mm screens for all movie fans (and other imaginative dreamers) to See!","

",osuokfan,21-Jul-23,"To everybody saying it's too boring, it's too long and there's too much talking, this movie is based off a biography of Oppenheimer's life during the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test, and everything that ensured after. This wasn't a movie about the bomb but what it represents. Just like the splitting of the atom starting a chain reaction that detonates, the birth of the atom bomb started a chain reaction of destruction and fear that is still felt to this day. The movie does an amazing job at getting the viewer to feel the emotions that Oppenheimer felt after seeing the aftermath of his creation. Devastation. The way they used imagery and camera work to accurately depict his fragile mental psyche following the bombs dropped in Japan to the blatant collusion of the U. S. Government against him and trying to discredit and blacklist him as a traitor after he spoke against the bomb. Christopher Nolan has solidified himself as a generational talent in directing, storytelling and imagery with this polarizing and operatic film.","

""Wonka"" could use more tart notes; at times it's borderline saccharine. There's no shiver of menace here, this is not the persona Willy Wonka is known for being sarcastic in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Wonka is a quirky, eccentric character who is known for brushing off questions and using sarcasm to ignore them ,this is what make the role such a good character Study .It takes only moments into the film, when star Timothée Chalamet first opens his mouth to sing, to discover Wonka's errors: The songs are that not good, and the guy singing them is even worse.Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka. Performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming . There is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesn't take me on a trip like the original did. Or for that matter the 2005 Johnny Depp version ; FYI If you love Weird and strange Depp's acting is for you. It is bat crazy !Some of the songs of this the 2023 reimaging tale weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless. On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive. 6/10.Everlasting gobstopper ...........No one will ever play the bright comic exterior and dark soul of Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder did in 1971. Wilder remains the gold standard in the role of Willy Wonka with his mad genius -- which featured a snarky edge and a hint of darkness.","

",vassiliskounelis,22-Jan-24,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience.

",isaacsundaralingam,23-Dec-23,"I don't think there was much doubt as to how Wonka would turn out to be. It was never supposed to be anything ground-breaking, nor was it supposed to punch above its weight. And as expected, Wonka turns out to be a decently delightful cinematic experience that nails the basics of a lighthearted film: a plot that keeps you engaged, characters with whom you can empathize, humor that's not too silly nor inappropriate, and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't deviate from a storytelling formula we've known to work. From start to finish, it maintains a charming and approachable tone that makes it enjoyable for audiences of all ages.What stands out the most in this movie is its colorful and innovative production design, where the visual aesthetics are nothing short of stunning. The attention to detail in both set design and cinematography contributes to creating a magical atmosphere that enhances the overall viewing experience. The musical numbers too complement the storyline well by adding a lively and entertaining dimension to the film, contributing to the overall enjoyment without overpowering the narrative.In summary, ""Wonka"" is a well-rounded and enjoyable movie that hits all the right notes.

We were looking forward to see Wonka, but then we were all disappointed.Movies is not bad, it's fairly entertaining, kids liked it, but we all agreed it's nowhere close to Tim Burton's movie. There was huge potential to bring some new magic into the chocolate world of Willy Wonka, but they failed to do that.During the movie, I never once felt the irresistible craving for chocolate, even though I'm a big fan of sweets. That's an unforgivable mistake. In Burton's film, I enjoyed the world of chocolate, from the beginning until the end. Also, the story is very average, focused mainly on the negative aspects of the world we live in. I don't know if they wanted to make a chocolate Oliver Twist, but the combination of the magical world of chocolate and the harsh realism of Charles Dickens just doesn't work together.

",magadalwarmayur,11-Dec-23,"Wonka, the latest film from director Paul King, takes us on a journey into the fantastical world of Willy Wonka's early life. While the film is visually delightful and boasts a strong performance from Timothée Chalamet, its chaotic story and forgettable music leave it feeling bittersweet.Chalamet shines as a young Willy Wonka, brimming with youthful enthusiasm and boundless creativity. His performance is a welcome departure from the more jaded interpretations of the character, injecting a much-needed dose of innocence and wonder. Olivia Colman and Hugh Grant round out the cast with memorable supporting roles, adding humor and depth to the film.The film's greatest strength lies in its visual feast. The vibrant sets and costumes bring the Chocolate Factory to life in all its fantastical glory, creating a truly immersive experience for the audience. King's signature whimsical style shines through, crafting a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere that is sure to captivate children and adults alike.However, Wonka's charm is somewhat diminished by its chaotic story. The plot feels convoluted and lacks focus, making it difficult to follow at times. This is further exacerbated by the film's foray into musical territory. While the songs are visually stunning, they are unfortunately plagued by generic melodies and forgettable lyrics. They ultimately feel disconnected from the narrative, serving as unwelcome interruptions rather than emotional enhancements.While not quite reaching the heights of King's Paddington films, Wonka manages to entertain with its whimsical tone and charming performances. Fans of Chalamet and visually stunning musicals will likely find much to enjoy. However, those seeking a more focused and emotionally resonant experience may find themselves left wanting. Overall, Wonka is a visually delightful and whimsical film that ultimately feels like a mixed bag of treats, leaving one with a taste of both satisfaction and disappointment.","

Wonka," Wonderfully musically chocolate fun
",burntoutboy,08-Dec-23,"I had high hopes with Wonka mainly due to the fact Paul King was directing. Paddington 1 &2 are some of the best family films ever made and their charm makes them a great watch every time. Wonka now joins that list.First off, the production design is spectacular. It really is pure imagination. The costumes, set pieces, songs and casting were all fantastic. The pacing was spot on and no time did I feel bored or that it dragged.Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa was brilliant but for me Timothee Chalamet stole the show. His singing and acting was fantastic and really immersed you in the Wonka story.2023 has been a fantastic year for film and Wonka rounds off the year perfectly. A must watch!","

Wonka," Weak
",DirkDiamond,13-Dec-23,"I would suggest watching only the trailer and, with memories of what you may have seen and read before, let that light up a little ""Pure Imagination,"" and leave it there. Don't go and see this film.The musical is built around the ""Pure imagination"" track from the original movie, however hasn't done much in it's attempts to spring board from there, creating rather a drab and uninspired musical around that!They shouldn't have used that original song, not really, in that it appears to have revealed a considerable lack of musical talent, in so far as the new songs are concerned, within a musical production, in this case!The musical whimpered on throughout a meaningless story, it all felt rather uninspired, with consideration to what came before it, featuring not a single character of interest, going on to fizzle out leaving nothing at all. I'm struggling to write about it in fact, it being almost entirely forgettable.Timothy's Wonka, the character, is actually very good, as are some of the villains within this, however everything else simply fails to leave a mark. Some rather bad story telling in this one. I'm quite shocked about this to be honest!","

Wonka," A whimsical, fun film that captures the spirit of Roald Dahl and is sure to entertain the younger crowd
",MrDHWong,14-Dec-23,"""Wonka"" is a musical fantasy film that serves as an origin story of the character of Willy Wonka from the novel ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl. Directed by Paul King (""Paddington"" 1 and 2) and starring Timothée Chalamet in the lead role, it is a whimsical, fun film that captures the spirit of Roald Dahl and is sure to entertain the younger crowd.In an unnamed European town, inventor and magician Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives to fulfil his childhood dream of running his own chocolate shop. Searching for a place to stay, Wonka stumbles upon a laundromat run by the suspicious Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), who offers him a room so long as he signs a contract. After failing to read the fine print, Wonka finds himself in debt to Mrs. Scrubbit and is forced to work around the clock to earn his freedom. While labouring away, Wonka meets five other people who are also indebted to Mrs. Scrubbit's contract; young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), plumber Piper (Natasha Rothwell), accountant Abacus (Jim Carter), phone operator Lottie (Rakhee Thakrar), and comedian Larry (Rich Fulcher). The five prisoners inform Wonka that the city is controlled by the ""Chocolate Cartel"", a trio of greedy chocolate makers - Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Mr. Fickelgruber (Mathew Boynton) - who are fiercely determined to eliminate any potential competition. Wonka teams up with his five new friends to hatch a scheme to bring down the cartel and make his chocolate available to everyone no matter their financial situation.One of the most popular children's stories of the twentieth century is Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", the timeless tale of a young boy named Charlie Bucket who is given the opportunity to meet the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka and visit his mysterious chocolate factory. Since it was first published back in 1964, the story has become a favourite among children the world over, with many like myself growing up reading it at school. Further cementing the story's popularity was the 1971 film adaptation ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and to a lesser extent Tim Burton's 2005 film ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Regardless of which of the two films you prefer, their success at the box office proves that the story is as renowned as it ever was, with the character of Willy Wonka attracting the most attention due to his quirky personality. The 2023 film ""Wonka"" gives us an origin story of the title character in a movie that should keep both children and adults entertained for most of the time.Although I'm not entirely sure if we needed to know about the origins of Willy Wonka, this film shows just barely enough about him to still retain that necessary air of mystery without completely ruining his character. When we first meet the young Wonka, he is shown to be ambitious about opening a chocolate shop, singing his passion for the sweet treat loudly from high atop a ship's mast. Upon arriving at his destination, Wonka learns to his dismay that this place is dreary, depressing, and has little time for fun-loving individuals like himself. In fact, no less than three minutes later, Wonka is even forced to pay a fine for daydreaming out in public. Things take a turn for the worst when Wonka is essentially forced into slavery to pay off a huge debt due to his inability to read a contract's fine print as a result of his illiteracy.In spite of all his hardships, Wonka's spirit remains untarnished as he is determined to share his wondrous treats with the world, no matter who or what stands in his way. What I enjoyed here was how the film was able to balance Wonka's confident oddball personality with that of him being the underdog in a new town, staying true to himself but still acknowledging the uphill battle he has to succeed in this harsh world. This is an important message that people of all ages can learn from, since becoming successful is not always an easy task and doing so without sacrificing your own integrity is a challenge within itself. As a result, the otherwise off-putting Willy Wonka becomes a relatable character the audience can find themselves identifying with.Being a musical, there are numerous moments in the film where characters break into song whenever it is necessary for them to communicate their inner monologues. While the songs were all fine and served their intended purpose, I found that most of them weren't all that memorable. The one original musical number I liked the most was near the beginning, where Wonka learns about the fates of his five co-workers/prisoners and how they are doomed to ""Scrub Scrub"" until all their debts are paid. The reason I enjoyed this the most was because it is done in the most Roald Dahl way possible, complete with word play, dark humour, and crackpot villains.Additionally, there are also some variations on the classic tunes from the 1971 film. For instance, the ""Oompa Loompa"" song makes not one but two appearances here, sung by an Oompa Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Instead of singing about misbehaving children, Lofty sings about why he is no longer welcome among his peers, which is both sad and funny once you learn the actual reason. The older viewers might appreciate the callbacks to the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" film and I'm certain the younger viewers will like the newer songs, but I can't really see any of them getting stuck in people's heads once the movie has finished.As the title character, I liked the youthful spin Timothée Chalamet was able to add to an already exceptionally outlandish individual. His take on Willy Wonka is that of an experienced young man who seems ready to take on the world, only to find that not everyone is there to support him in his endeavours. Chalamet's Wonka seems to be unique among his predecessors in that he does not seem to be the younger version of either one, although he does show some of the condescending traits of Gene Wilder's version and the melancholic insecurities of Johnny Depp's version. This almost seems like a compromise of sorts, as though the filmmakers tried to combine both Wilder's and Depp's Wonkas into one so as not to alienate the fans too much. I would say this does work for the most part, however, I personally think they should have just picked one and gone with that instead.Most of the supporting cast were quite good, especially Wonka's five co-workers turned friends who assist him on his mission. With that in mind, Noodle is clearly the main one out of the five that receives the most attention in the story. Although I did like the idea of her being Wonka's street smart friend, I think there was one important thing about her character that is never explained. Early in the film, we learn that Wonka is illiterate, struggling to comprehend even single letters of the alphabet, which is where Noodle comes in to teach him how to read. Being an orphan who never went to school, how did Noodle become intelligent enough to be able to educate a grown man on the basics of reading and writing? We never find out how she acquired this level of education, so this seems like a major plot hole the movie glosses over. I'm not sure if this is the film's way of saying children are sometimes smarter than adults, but it would have been nice to have been provided some explanation as to how an orphan raised on the streets is capable of teaching an adult man comprehensive English skills.I thought the three main villains were rather amusing at times, but Mr. Slugworth is clearly the leader of the trio. Slugworth is shown to be the brains of this whole operation, which is established by the firm, aggressive handshake he gives to everyone he meets. This film treats him and his two colleagues as though they are running some kind of narcotics ring, only with chocolate instead of drugs. I suppose this would make Slugworth the Gus Fring of chocolatiering, which is made evident by his widespread infamy over the entire town. On that note, I just wish we could have seen more of Mr. Prodnose's and Mr. Fickelgruber's intimidating influence throughout the story. It just seems like all of Matt Lucas's and Mathew Baynton's comedic talents are going to waste here, as their characters serve little purpose other than to agree with everything Slugworth says.Though far from essential viewing, ""Wonka"" still serves its purpose as an enjoyable origin story of the most famous fictional chocolate maker in all of children's literature. It may not instil the same level of wonder as the other two feature films before it, but it provides just enough entertainment for a casual viewing with the whole family. Had the film placed more focus on developing its supporting cast and fixing some plot holes, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Still, you could definitely do a whole lot worse than what we got so all I can say is just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.I rate it 7/10.","

",Selina_Hazey,10-Dec-23,"As a child I grew up absolutely loving Gene Wilder in the role, I didn't care for Johnny Depp, that film was just too weird, along comes Chalamet, pretty good in the part, I just wasn't crazy about the film.I felt as though I was watching a musical somewhere in The West End, lots of musical numbers, and a plot which was there, but more so for the sake of it.1971's film presents us with a world of magic, what child (or adult for that matter) wouldn't have wanted to get into that factory, and didn't end up singing those songs, sadly there's none of that here. It's very well made, it's well acted, all that's missing is the magic.I know I shouldn't be comparing it to the past, it's better than the Depp movie, but not a patch on Wilder's.","

Wonka," Slightly Whimsical But Mostly Boring
",Socolorfull,07-Jan-24,"Boring about sums it up. We all know that just because a film has a few big names in it doesn't mean it will be great. It tries to be whimsical, but fails. The songs are mediocre. Noodle is supposed to be the heart of the movie, but her acting leaves much to be desired. Yes, she is a child, but if you're going to make a child the emotional center of a movie, that child needs to be able to carry that, and she can't.Has any sequal/prequel/offshoot of the Wonka universe ever captured the zany magic of the original? I don't think so, so maybe we should stop trying.This movie was at its best and most fun when people were eating wonka's magical chocolate. Everything in between that was just bad fluff. The repetitiveness of the movie was grating to me. Please stop with the same joke over and over and over again.The end did come to a sweet conclusion that may make you tear up a bit, but the ride to get there just isn't worth it.Skip this one. And if you are going to see it, don't bring your three year old with you. Where in the previews did it seem like this would be a movie that would entertain a toddler??? It's a live action musical, for goodness sake. Please save yourself, and everyone else in the theater, a headache, and don't bring your toddler to this movie.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!Who thought that a chocolate cartel would be a fun little plot device? This movie was billed as a family film. While sure, there are things in a family film meant to go over the head of the kids in the audience, these are usually throwaway jokes that don't impact understanding of the plot. The chocolate cartel was the WHOLE conflict of the movie. What does a child know about a cartel?","

Wonka," Felt the Satire...
",Cirdl3,31-Dec-23,"Felt like a satire movie for the government and those important rich people that already ruled the world for those poor people. The message in this movie is good enough, brilliant! Paul can made a satire movie for the governments and wrapped it to a child movie and make it feel easy to understand.When the police gain weight it really captured the government who bribe a money. They really teaches young audiences about bribery, corruption, and government. Besides that the visual in this movie looks wholesome, the CGI looks good enough. Paul made a great story telling and great characters development. Sometimes the acting is to much especially for Timothee acting.The soundtracks are catchy and great, the musical in this movie is not that spectacular, with a lot of back dancer and awesome choreograph, but it still good enough for musical and choreograph.In the end, Wonka prequel is good with all the aspect they have, satire movie but wrapped it to a childish movie, great soundtrack, fine editing with PowerPoint transitions, good enough acting, and strong messages.","

I was so bored. The music was awful, the singing even worse. The story was terribly weak and very dull. I couldn't care less. I couldn't get invested in any of the characters apart from Hugh Grant who was adorable. He was the only character that kept me marginally entertained.The snowy cold scenes made it feel Christmassy, a bit like a Dickensian film which was okay. It just lacked magic. It could have been so much more.I just wanted to leave the cinema. If I had gone to watch this film on my own, I would have left.","

Wonka," Surprisingly un-Wonka
",Alexandre1553,22-Jan-24,"For a movie about one of the most magical characters in literature, this is a surprisingly un-magical movie.I can hardly call this an ""origin"" story. The movie feels more like an episode of Wonka's adventures, and that's it. Doesn't stand out as a movie at all.You can tell Wonka is extraordinary: he produces the best chocolate in the world from night to day, and everything about him comes with a magic trick. But there's never really a look into his magic. Instead, this is a very campy adventure about this silly guy and his friends trying to escape the bad guys. That's it.Disappointing. A couple of songs stand out. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm not into something this campy.However, Timothée Chalamet stands out. He proves he's a very good actor who can pull off almost any role. Who would know the ""Call Me By Your Name"" boy could play such a silly character with such confidence. He is the greatest thing about the movie. Too bad about the movie itself though.","

Wonka," Boring and uninspired.....
",flicklover,28-Dec-23,I am the first one to admit that I am not a fan of musicals so when I see one it already has a big strike against it. Also I absolutely love the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film starring Gene Wilder. It was the type of film that is no longer made successfullybthese days. A musical with great central performance and great supporting characters. And most of all a whimsical quality that is endearing and memorable. This new film Wonka had none of that....It is the backstory of Willy Wonka. Wonka is played by Timothée Chalamet. His performance is not a bad one but he dies not embody the character like I wish he would. There is nothing distinctive about his performance. I understand that he's playing a young Wonka but this character seems completely different from the one played by Gene Wilder. The story is basically about Wonka arriving in Europe to open his chocolate shop. The owners of the the big chocolate factories want to destroy him. Along the way there is a collection of completely forgettable songs and characters that are also forgettable. I get that this is a musical and not high drama but nothing that happens is not at all involving. The production values are good but the film has no sense of wonder and whimsy that this story requires. I was mostly bored. There are a couple decent moments but it just a film without inspiration....Grade: C-,"

Wonka," Come with me, and you'll be, In a world lacking imagination
",haydyno,16-Dec-23,"This movie is advertised as an origin to Willy Wonka. Instead it should be advertised as a musical that has a merry-go-round plot that never actually progresses. We don't actually know anything else about Wonka that we know from the original.The plot starts off with Wonka getting trapped in smelly laundry/hotel with some other prisoners. Right then and there the writers trap the main character behind an almost impossible way of escape. So for about an hour of this film, Wonka attempts to escape this, and ultimately gets bought out by Slugworth. His candy shop is destroyed, and then he decides he wants to help Noodle by going after his ""Chocolate Mafia"". The last minute of the movie rushes around with Wonka and the Oompa Loompa creating a factory and that's it.Hugh Grant delivers an awesome Oompa Loompa performance, however his lack of screen time and interaction with Wonka was very disappointing.If you're going to this movie expecting to see how Wonka creates his inventions, chocolates, factory, and discovery of Oompa Land, well you'll be leaving like a bad batch of Wonka chocolate.","

Wonka," Good movie with many problems
",tarascopablo,12-Dec-23,"First of all... This new take on a young Wonka is actually fresh and interesting. We were used on Wonka being a secondary character of Charlie and the golden ticket story.The movie is well crafted but it has serious problems:i) Chalamet is a fantastic actor and has the potential to be one of the great ones of his generation BUT he was a miscast. Im sorry, but i just don´t see him as Wonka.Ii) Part of what makes a musical great is that the songs and numbers are meant to be remarkable and catchy. After almost 80 years, people still sing singin´in the rain yet Wonka has no memorable song or tune except for the Oompa Loompa bit that was taken straight outta the original one.To me, this 2 flaws are terrible and make it a bad Wonka movie and a bad musical but taking those out of the equation, it is actually a good film.Enjoy it with your loved ones,Stay safe and happy holidays.","

Wonka," A world of pure disappointment
",Dargumin,10-Dec-23,"When I saw Paul King (who has done a wonderful job with the Paddington films) was directing the new Wonka a film I must admit I was a little optimistic. But sadly rather than seeing a world of pure imagination it really was a world of pure disappointment.Timothee Chalamet had big shoes to fill, following on from the late great Gene Wilder and living legend Johnny Depp in portraying the titular zany choclatier. Sadly he does not have the charisma of either. It was frustrating that he didn't show any of the crankiness or attitude which made Gene Wilder's version of Wonka so brilliant, instead he's presented as a naive dreamer.As a musical, the songs were so mediocre, I can't imagine the kids will remember any of them once they've left the cinema, barring the ones we've heard before in the other films. The film would have been less tiresome if they had skipped many of these songs.At one point during the film I looked at my watch hopeful that there wasn't too much of the film left, yet it turned out it had only been on for 45 minutes at this point and it still had over an hour to go, I literally couldn't comprehend how that first 45 minutes had felt so much longer.If I can say one nice thing, it's that Olivia Coleman, Paterson Joseph and Rich Fulcher were the hilights and helped make the 2 hour slog just about bearable.","

",HeydarEntertainment,04-Jan-24,"This Movie was good, it had some good elements in it, a little plot twist and some good writing, humor, but it had too much singing! That ruined my experience, the old one (1971) Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory will be a timeless Classic it had humor and more and also some music elements but there weren't that many and they went by very fast. This is going to be a Hard one. I'll give it a 5-6 out of 10. (PS: J watched the Movie in German because I live in Germany). Wonka was an interesting Prequel, it made me laugh sometimes and was very interesting. This Review was Spoiler Free :) Event though Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a Success and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was too doesn't mean it needs another Movie, Warner Bros.-Power is a gift, do not abuse it.-Roald Dahl (13.

Wonka," Worst movie I've seen in a long while
",lakonur,09-Dec-23,"In this latest film, it's clear that something vital is missing. Despite the commendable efforts of a talented cast, they struggle against a script that is both boring and predictable. Their performance, while earnest, cannot elevate the lackluster storyline.The music, often a redeeming feature in such films, sadly fails to deliver. It doesn't capture the audience's interest or invite participation. There's a noticeable lack of catchy tunes or engaging rhythms, making the musical aspect forgettable.Targeted at families, the film surprisingly doesn't resonate with children. The humor is limited and mostly revealed in the trailers, leaving little to be discovered in the theater. The sporadic laughs from the younger viewers are few and far between, indicating the film's failure to connect with its intended audience.A key element missing is the enchanting and quirky charm typically associated with ""Wonka movies."" This film follows a too straightforward and mundane path, lacking the vibrancy and uniqueness that made previous films stand out. Overall, it's a disappointing experience that lacks the magic and personality needed to make it memorable.","

Don't go thinking this will be the classical Gene Wilder Willy Wonka. This movie appeared to have so much potential, but in reality the previews hyped it up. Can't really call it a prequel when it doesn't really relate to the original movie. The songs were bad. Timothee Chalamet tries to pull off The Greatest Showman impression and comes up short.

",dougy-tz,25-Jan-24,"Willy Wonka almost seemed like a side character in his own movie. Instead of being about Wonka and the Oompa Loompa (played very well by Hugh Grant) it's more about an orphan girl called Noodle. God forbid you could make a movie about a white man doing something positive on his own merit. Imagine how fun the movie could have been with the Oompa Loompa and Wonka making the beginnings of the chocolate factory from the ground up, traveling the world and getting to know lots of interesting sub characters from around the world (then at least the forced inclusivity would have made sense.) Instead the whole movie is centred around a little area where the rival chocolate makers shops are located, they are boring forgettable characters as are 90 percent of the characters in the movie. You're not going to find people 30 years from now still using the names like you would with a Veruca Salt to describe someone's behaviour. In fact I genuinely doubt people will still be talking about this in a few months time, like most recent Hollywood drivel it's another forgetful movie from the meat grinder.The movie is bizarre most of the time, with ridiculous out of this world magic tricks happening that make no sense. Timotheé Chalamet seemed to be doing his best Jim Carrey impression as well. They could have made this movie and called it something else, you really don't have to tarnish the name of such an iconic character.

God forbid you could make a movie about a white man doing something positive on his own merit. Imagine how fun the movie could have been with the Oompa Loompa and Wonka making the beginnings of the chocolate factory from the ground up, traveling the world and getting to know lots of interesting sub characters from around the world (then at least the forced inclusivity would have made sense.) Instead the whole movie is centred around a little area where the rival chocolate makers shops are located, they are boring forgettable characters as are 90 percent of the characters in the movie. You're not going to find people 30 years from now still using the names like you would with a Veruca Salt to describe someone's behaviour. In fact I genuinely doubt people will still be talking about this in a few months time, like most recent Hollywood drivel it's another forgetful movie from the meat grinder.The movie is bizarre most of the time, with ridiculous out of this world magic tricks happening that make no sense. Timotheé Chalamet seemed to be doing his best Jim Carrey impression as well. They could have made this movie and called it something else, you really don't have to tarnish the name of such an iconic character. I really wish I hadn't given this movie the time of day as it wasn't worth it.","

Wonka," Tom Davis perfection
",hchmmyzv,27-Jan-24,"I saw this film on a rainy Sunday afternoon with my husband and adult son and we loved it. Paul King perfection that is a delight to watch, and which lifted our spirits and provided momentary escape from the real world. I loved the entire film but Tom Davis performance was a highlight. I cannot I see him in a mini kimono with a tiny tea cup and saucer. Comic genius no doubt facilitated by partnering with Olivia Colman in the film. It's not as wonderful as Paddington or Paddington 2 but that's ok, a tough act to follow. However, I would happily watch any Paul King film multiple times - there's no side to the humour - pure joy.","

Wonka," Willy wonka and the high school production
",lei_lei1,07-Jan-24,"Its clear that warner bros have chosen a director for this movie with a real vision for what it could look like, because quite literally 90% of the budget went into its set design (and rowan atkinson).In all seriousness though, the set design is gorgeous. Glamorous actually, would be a better word to put it. Great trees with pink tinted rosy petals and 20th Century alleyways that look like they're from the set of Harry Potter and all the color and lights you could want in a lifetime.But everything else in the movie just doesn't live up to the set design. The acting feels artificial. Lines feel memorized and delivered without intent, which makes it hard to concentrate on the movie. The best performance we saw throughout the entire movie was literally from the oompa loompa. And for a musical, this movie is just weak. Songs feel forced, and lyrics fail miserably to hit the mark. Like take a look at this stuff:""If you want to view paradise, simply look at them and view it Somebody to hold on to, it's all we really need, nothing else to it""Also I should probably mention that like 90% of the actors can't sing and rely heavily on autotune, which is obviously perfect for a musical. But nonetheless, I enjoyed watching the movie. I won't ever watch it again nor remember any of its songs, but it felt good watching it. That's all I can say. If you have a kids or a family or are just in the mood for some nice lighthearted chocolate factory lore, you will like this movie. It felt like a music video or a high school production actually. Rehearsed lines, funky costumes, characters that try to be funny, but it felt good and it kinda made sense, and I don't regret watching it. It kinda made me feel like a kid actually, and I liked that.3/10. Not. The highest rating, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie.","

",qjxsfpqd,06-Jan-24,"The movie was absolutely bad. Don't get me wrong, I really like the original movies, but this one... I didn't even realize it was a musical at first and by the time I figured it out after the first few songs, it was over for me. I don't even think it was necessary to make a musical out of it. Not even Chalamet was as good in this movie as he normally is. The plot made absolutely no sense, the jokes were nowhere near funny, some of the songs were so bad that I was about to walk out of the theater. I was definitely not the only one who thought that.In my opinion, the movie was only made for the money, not to tell a good story. Wasted money and brain cells, don't watch it if you don't want to waste your time.","

Wonka," Challenging viewing experience
",christopher-19951,04-Jan-24,"This new film adaptation of Wonka left me soo disappointed; it falls short of expectations. The musical aspect felt lacking, deviating significantly from the original's darker themes. It seemed to stray far from the essence that Wonka fans hold dear. This movie just felt way more fantastical and like some Dr Suess alternate universe with Wonka. The plot dragged on unnecessarily, making me wish it could have been wrapped up in a concise 30 minutes. The Oompa Loompas' appearance was underwhelming, and the heavy reliance on CGI made the viewing experience challenging. While I understand it's geared towards children, the cringy comedy and lengthy storyline might test even their attention spans. Although Timothée's singing voice didn't resonate with me, there were a few moments that brought some laughter- (all independently from the movie, I was laughing at it, not with it). In summary, the film turned out to be a mediocre experience for me.","

Wonka," Good enough for a Willy Wonka origin story
",Ingrouille181,11-Dec-23,"I had no interest in seeing Wonka. Just like Solo: A Star Wars Story, I didn't need a movie about Willy Wonka's backstory; his real story is in the main story of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Sometimes less is more, and leaving his backstory out gives him more mystery and intrigue. I liked Timothee Chalamet as Wonka well enough, he's got great charisma, and all of the other cast do a great job too. The songs are really hit or miss, and most feel like songs I've heard in lesser known musicals before. It's passable for a Willy Wonka origin story. I appreciated the characters love of chocolate and wonder. But I think a movie like 2000s Chocolat (ironically staring Johnny Depp) plays with the love of chocolate and fantasy better, I'd recommend it more than this. Maybe giving Wonka the Greatest Showman set up would've helped this movie more. If you're a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory fan, this probably won't do much for you. I'll give it a solid 6 out of 10.","

Wonka," Don't Expect Previous Wonka's - But Worth Watching & Why..
",dan_slentz,19-Dec-23,"Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies - Movie Review (12/16/23): ""Wonka"". First thing to know is to NOT expect either previous version of the movie related to the character. It's neither Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp's version. It's not about a kid coming to the factory after getting a gold ticket. Nothing like that.. so don't expect it. This is Willy's return after going to Oompa Loompa Land and wanting to start making chocolate. Knowing that will help you by not having wrong expectations. In this case, Willie goes up against a ""gang of three different chocolatiers"" (one is Slugworth).The movie is worth seeing.. and it's a movie event, but be aware that it certainly feels more like a stage play in some respect as the acting is ""big"".. as if exaggerated and animated, as if it's being played TO an audience.Timothee Chalamet does a nice job as Willy Wonka, but he fortunately doesn't have the craziness of Depp's Wonka, but neither quite the warmth or interesting appeal as Wilder's Wonka. Don't expect Wilder or Depp's Wonkas, and that will also help your expectations.Though this isn't a musical, there's a fair bit of music and songs in this new version. Some of the music is a bit campy, but some of the music and songs WILL bring back fond memories of the Gene Wilder version of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".I can say that for about the first half of the movie, I really wasn't enjoying this new version of the movie much.. but after about half way through the movie, I started to like and appreciate this movie for what IT is, and not what it isn't (which is like the other two).As I said, do NOT expect the previous other two Wonka movies and look for something completely new. If you go into it and keep a ""clean slate"" image and appreciate it as a brand new movie, I think you'll like it more.Only other note is that Chalamet sings in the movie, and he's not bad, but he's also not as good as an actor like Hugh Jackman (who is an actor who is also an excellent singer.. and other similar actors with well-trained singing voices).The story line is a good one, and the acting is very good by Wonka and the others who are ""in debt"" (you'll understand if/when you see the movie), but the actors portraying the chocolatiers and police are more like the over-acting characters from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (cartoonish in their over-acting). I'd give this movie a 6.2 and say that it's definitely worth seeing.. and seeing on a big screen. I think if the director had taken this movie a little less ""Chitty Chitty-ish"", I would be up in the mid 7 rating... or even a little higher. Go see Wonka at the theater!","

Wonka," missing the wonka spark
",ferguson-6,12-Dec-23,"Greetings again from the darkness. It appears as though I'm one of the few early viewers who walked away without having been beguiled or enraptured with this musical prequel to Roald Dahl's 1964 story, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Full disclosure requires me to admit that I actually found it a bit dull, and that's mostly due to the lead performance by Timothy Chalamet. I understand that he's the hottest young actor working today, and brings along an entire fan base, but for me, Willy Wonka should have a twinkle in his eye, a spring in his step, and enough charm to draw folks in ... even at a younger age.Writer-director Paul King and co-writer Simon Farnaby collaborated on the thoroughly entertaining PADDINGTON 2 (2017) and are back at it in this third film from Dahl's classic children story. Most recently, there was Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005), and it's been more than 50 years since Gene Wilder bounded between charming and menacing in Mel Stuart's WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971). King and Farnaby deliver an origin story which allows for a much nicer (or should it be sweeter) Willy Wonka, and instead sprinkles the menace on a few supporting characters, ensuring some dark themes are present.A ""deal"" with Willy's mother (Sally Hawkins) has the illiterate Wonka arriving in town with only a few coins in his pocket, and a dream to build his chocolate factory. His innocence and naivety soon leave him penniless and contracted into indentured servitude, along with some others, at a shady laundry establishment run by the dentally challenged Mrs Scrubbitt (Oscar winner Olivia Colman) and her baritone behemoth assistant Bleacher (Tom Davis). Willy bonds with the others being held captive, including young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), who somehow holds the same optimistic outlook as her new friend. Willy soon discovers that he has landed in the town with a chocolate cartel led by Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton), the local chocolatiers who bribe the Police Chief (Keegan-Michael Key) with none other than ... chocolate, in order to keep the new kid from selling his superior goodies.Willy has even more challenges to deal with, including a knee-high, orange-faced Oompa-Loompa (Hugh Grant), who seeks restitution by stealing from Willy Wonka while he sleeps. Grant's Oompa-Loompa is a definite highlight here (just as he was in PADDINGTON 2), especially during his song. The other familiar song in the film is ""Pure Imagination"", though none of the new songs by Neil Hannon are particular catchy or memorable.In addition to Grant's sarcastic Oompa-Loompa, another highlight is certainly Nathan Crowley's Production Design, ranging from Scrubbitt's grungy basement to the picturesque town square and ultimately, the chocolate store sequence. The decision to have the young, idealistic Willy overflowing with optimism and lacking the grumpiness and menace of the grown Wonka makes sense for an origin story ... I simply didn't find it as magical, as entertaining, or as interesting.Opens in theaters nationwide on December 15, 2023.","

",ianharrison747,29-Jan-24,"After grappling for a whole twenty minutes with the pseudo pretentious Maestro, one was even more apprehensive about Wonka. Scrub -scrub, in for a penny, in for a whole box of chocolates.It's definitely Dahl not dull, Harry Potter with humour and Hugo with chocolate. Being confronted by the shop steward from Made in Dagenham, the Vicar from Four Weddings, the butler from Downtown, Matt from Little Britain and Hugh Grant from everywhere- it's not plain chocolate. Timothee Chalamet with one of those grave things I can't find on my phone and Calah Lane as Noodle were super whilst vulnerable and likeable as the leads.The pair that stole the show with the fantastic nasty parts were Olivia Coleman and Tom Davis as Scrubbit and Bleaker romping through their unfriendly guest house. The use of CGI was hilarious and colourful, just amazing with the sets. Music was fab despite the fact I hate musicals. ! Hats off to director Paul King. Yes we know he had a massive 125 million dollars budget even allowing him to shoot in Watford- he created a great film for all ages and backgrounds. Oops and watch out for Hugh as an orange man with green hair.","

",gnillipsemaj,01-Jan-24,"I do not often like musicals. I am, as I'm sure millions of other people are a massive fan of Roald Dahl's work. I was very sceptical of what this may be like. I was surprised and delighted with this film. I think anyone who is very familiar with Roald's work will see that the creators of this really understand how he wrote and why and have honoured his brilliance in respectful and intelligent ways. Yes sure it's a total fantasy and quite silly, but once you tune in with that and allow yourself to enjoy what it is it is a great ride. Some songs are irritating and a bit poor but others are beautifully written and really funny. What this film really excels at is the delightful design of everything, if you enjoy that in a film you will love the world created here it is beautiful, magical, ingenious and spectacular. The score is also very nicely woven and had me a bit teary a few times. I really admire how it has been linked in many ways to the original, respectfully and tastefully. It goes without saying the cast is brilliant. Watch it. It's lovely.","

I didn't laugh, didn't cry, didn't enjoy watching any of the characters! Wonka wasn't a poor child who lived with a poor single mother, and certainly wasn't a magician with an endless portal hat! He was a child of a rich dentist who didn't let willy eat chocolate because of his teeth. This movie is for kids that's right but writers could stick to original story at least.

Wonka," Take me back to the factory
",oliverwilkins1,07-Jan-24,"Roald Dahl was renowned as a storyteller so a character driven take on Willy Wonka's coming of age was always going to be a challenging task and for me this has to go down as a failure.Firstly it must be said this is not the fault of the lead actor who plays a believable and authentic young Wonka. Nor indeed the assemble cast including notable funny interludes from Hugh Grant and Rowen Atkinson to name just two.The costumes were also exceptional and one of my real highlights. However the fundamental story and storytelling was really muddled and the basic principle of a musical, that the musical interludes augment and advance the plot was missing, forgivable if songs themselves are catchy and not entirely forgettable.Wonka tries to set itself in a magical world. One where it can go from snowy wonderland to balmy summer nights from scene to scene. Where Wonka himself is the arbiter of magic in the form of chocolate. Want to fly? There's a chocolate for that! Want to be inspired? Guess what, there's a chocolate for that too.But get trapped in a formulaic predicament not of your making? Well suddenly you've only got your good old fashioned wits to rely on. It doesn't make sense.One could argue that it's not supposed to make sense, it is about magical chocolate after all. Which is probably the best argument to make. It's just it doesn't sit right with me. The joy of the chocolate factory, is that the magic was held within it, it was limited. By letting the genie out of the lamp and having unlimited wishes they've removed the suspense, the wonderment and the drama.","

It was imaginative, entertaining and a great film for the whole family. It does justice to this beloved eccentric character who so many of us grew up watching.

Wonka," Do you have a sweet tooth?
",chand-suhas,07-Dec-23,"Willy Wonka's origin story puts him in London, where he wants to make his long dream come true. With the most unique recipes, he quickly establishes himself as the best chocolate maker which irks the trio of the chocolate cartel. They want him gone in order to have their monopoly. How Wonka finds his unlikely family in London, who support him to make his dream turn into reality as well as take on the trio of villains forms rest of the story.This musical aims to establish this as a sweet film right with Wonka's introduction in the opening credits and it succeeds in that. Atleast 3 songs stood out and the back story to Noodles provide the much needed drama. There is also Wonka's bonding with his own mother. The songs compliment these emotions as well as the wacky ambition of the young chocolate maker. With the likes of Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan-Michael Key in the supporting cast, makes it even easier in keeping the entertainment intact.The humor worked for me throughout and Timothee Chalamet brought some freshness with his take on the titular character. Calah Lane as Noodles was another standout character. The songs keep entertaining and so does the comedy scenes followed enough dose of drama without dragging the story. Ofcourse adult Wonka turned out to be quiet different and this film doesn't try to reveal anything about that, presenting Wonka as this sweetest boy learning to value relationship and succeeding in his dream to open a chocolate shop. It's a screenplay of convenience and there isn't much to complain.","

Wonka," Wilder, Depp and Chalamet
",GusherPop,19-Dec-23,"""Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy.""
""Wonka"" is a two-hour musical comedy directed by Paul King, inspired by Roald Dahl's Wonka books but not strictly following them. The film aims to amuse, delight, and inspire cheers when the bad guys are defeated. The performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are likely better than needed to make it a hit, as it is considered a pre-sold property, as many people know and love Willy Wonka. Wonka and Noodle, two orphans, are sympathetic to Wonka's situation. Wonka carries a chocolate bar created by his mom, a candy-maker, for inspiration. The main bad guys are a trio of powerful businessmen who control candy manufacturing and distribution, keep the city's corrupt police force under their control, and have passed laws making it difficult for anyone else to break into the business. The film features Sally Hawkins as Mama Wonka, who becomes a good luck charm for big-budget fantasies. ""Wonka"" is a captivating and enthusiastic film, with a withholding quality from the character of Wonka, who can be likened to Gene Wilder's long-lost grandchild in moments of quiet contemplation and madcap inspiration. The film's effectiveness makes it a cynical enterprise. Wonka, portrayed by Chalamet, is an innocent and earnest character with a distinctly British sensibility. Unlike Depp's and Wilder's portrayals, Chalamet lacks guile and is guarded in an unnamed European city. The humor is set against a visually dense Technicolor world, with costumes and sets beautifully made. Willy Chalamet's performance in ""Wonka"" is a captivating portrayal of a boyish sweetness with a hint of sadness, expressing his love for chocolate-making. He is portrayed as a wholesome character, resembling P. T. Barnum played by Daniel Day-Lewis' son, Chalamet. Chalamet's heartfelt baritone singing is a testament to his character's wholesome nature. The film's lines, such as ""Put your hand inside your pock-elet, get yourself some Wonka chocolate!"", are a testament to the character's belief in the power of chocolate and its ability to elevate one's mood and life. Chalamet's performance is a testament to the power of chocolate and its ability to change lives. The film overrelies on computer-generated effects and stunts, including a miniaturized performance by Hugh Grant as the Oompa-Loompa Lofty. Despite skepticism, Chalamet gives himself fully to the wonderment and vocal demands of the role. The film is a playful, heart-tugging take on a beloved character that is smarter than it lets on. The film's beautiful costumes and sets make it outstanding to watch. ""Wonka"" is a musical prequel to the Roald Dahl tale, featuring Timothée Chalamet as the title character. Willy, a 25-year-old chocolate lover, arrives in London after seven years of sailing around the globe. He has recipes for his candy, such as hoverchoc, an egg of chocolate with a bug inside that causes levitate. Chalamet's character is characterized by a long purple coat, vest, ascot, and rumpled top hat. Willy's dream is to bring the wonder of his candy to everyone in the world, bringing his passion for chocolate to life.","

His color inspirations and drive backed by a lack of common sense defines his name.The creative uses of candy and colorful creations are enough to inspire anyone.

",teddabread2,29-Dec-23,"When I heard that there was going to be a prequel to the first two Willy Wonka movies I got very excited! It was also quite exciting to see a new actor that i've heard a lot about that plays Wonka in this movie. Timothée Chalamet.I didn't know a lot about this actor except that he was quite famous and had been in a lot of famous movies like Dune, Little Women, Bones and All, Don't Look Up and more popular movies. Matter of fact, this was my first movie that I saw with Timothée Chalamet being a big actor in it, also the first movie I saw that had him in it. No offence, but i didn't think that he would have the right personality to success like for example the Johnny Depp Wonka. But oh boy. This movie was actually REALLY good!Positives:The acting is good.The dialogue is good.The musical is good.The cinematography is good.The CGI is quite good.The characters are likeable.The villains are actually VERY good, same with the heroes.The movie has some cool scenes and themes.The jokes/comedy in the movie is MOST of the time a bit funny even for an older audience, and DEFINITELY very good for a younger audience!Timothée Chalamet as Wonka is actually a pretty good choice, he also has some nice musical skills. It would be nice to see a sequel of this movie with Timothée playing Wonka once again and Noodle being in the story of the movie too, once again, they are a good team for the movie and are pretty likeable characters that make you root for them.The movie has a good runtime.The movie has a good pace.The movie has some good and SURPRISING actors in the movie like Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean), Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, Tom Davis, Simon Farnaby and more!If you pay a lot of attention in the movie, and if you've seen both Paddington movies, then theres a high chance that you'll recognise 4 actors, more or less, that different actors have been in one Paddington movie, or both!The fantasy in the movie is very good.The movie is very wholesome and definitely keeps you focused with the charming tone and theme to the movie that matches with the movie being a musical.Most of the movies surprising actors are actually VERY good for not only being in Mr. Bean or the Johnny English movies (like Rowan Atkinson), but also for the Paddington actors that surprisingly ALSO fit good into this movie!The movie still manages to keep that Willy Wonka style to it and doesn't only do it in a, ""Welcome to my chocolate factory!"" Way and then some troubling moments happen to some people in the movie.However, THIS movie manages to keep a creative and DIFFERENT idea to it as well as a much more different plot compared to the other Willy Wonka movies. And it works VERY well!The movie is creative and unique.Negatives:The comedy in this movie sometimes isn't that funny and falls flat if you're watching this as an older audience.It feels like some of the actors in the movie don't try to have their absolute BEST charm to them.Timothée Chalamet sometimes in this movie doesn't really have that ""I am Willy Wonka!"" Feeling to him and more has that ""I am a person who can make magical chocolate!"". I mean. It's creative and all, but he doesn't really match that well for especially that Johnny Depp Willy Wonka style. That weird, funny and confused person which is the personality that Johnny Depp's try in being Willy Wonka had.The movie sometimes doesn't have singing in like very PERFECT opportunities which is quite sad and ruins a bit of the moment.Sometimes the CGI in the movie is quite obvious, but otherwise it's very good.Overall this movie is VERY good and MUCH better than I expected! Even if you aren't that big of a fan when it comes to Musicals you'll still have a big chance to like this movie, especially if you like Willy Wonka and want to have some originality which is a quite different story to the other Willy Wonka movies. I DEFINITELY recommend this movie!","

Wonka," Fun for the Family
",chenp-54708,09-Dec-23,"It's a decent origin story about the character of Willy Wonka with good performances, beautiful production, musical tracks, and some good humor. Director Paul King, known for his works on Paddington 1 and 2, does a solid role in handling the setting and themes. The production, color presentations, and the sound designs are great with some good visuals effects and style. All the performances are pretty good as Timothée Chalamet, Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant and the rest of the cast members are all fun to observe. Rowan Atkinson is always a blast to see.The narrative is standard and King does try to provide some new interesting elements and style to the story and characters and there are some concepts that worked and some that could have been better. On the humor and singing, there are some good singing moments from the cast members and the humor was solid, although some humorous moments felt flat. The character of Willy Wonka is fun to observe but the other characters weren't really that investing or emotionally engaging to connect with. Some dialogue moments could be better.While it's not amazing, the pacing was good and I was still invested to see where the movie was heading. Overall, it's definitely not the best movie from Paul King but it's still entertaining with fun visuals and a good time to watch for the Christmas Season. Now time to eat some chocolate.","

Wonka," Really Quite Exceptionally Horrible!
",martimusross,28-Jan-24,"WonkaOh dear!It was quite inexplicable, this movie was an origin story for Willy Wonka, why anyone thought this was needed, necessary or appropriate I have no clue.It had no touch of Dahl at all, and his wicked cruel sense of children's humour beloved across the world. This was a bland facsimile populated by beige characters.I watched it because of Timothée Chalamet, Hugh Grant, Tom Davis and Olivia Coleman and they really tried to make something of this putrid pastiche. The acting was top hole but the script was bottom drawer. Mister Dahl would have hated it, and never watched, whilst taking a fat cheque in royalties, ever the mercenary!Timothée's singing and dancing was excellent but embedded in a flawed monstrosity of imagination.I cannot see any child enjoying this having been press-ganged by their parents to go to the movies.I'm giving this a firm 3 outta 10, having ruminated over this, I give all 3 points to Hugh Grant he was horribly fabulous!","

",xxrenxx,20-Jan-24,"This movie had none of the appeal of any version of the Roald Dahl novel, it certainly doesn't qualify as
the sequel it was advertised to be when there's no perceivable way from this story to evolve into any version of the original story.The musical numbers are weaker even than the casting. The entire movie plays out like a cheap stage production in which none of the actors wanted to perform.There was no need to retell wonka's story to make him a sad, likeable type when the entire original concept leans heavily on his dark nature and outright insanity. Just felt like watching a cash grab that'll be tossed on the pile of movies noone asked for.","

",superjohnn,10-Dec-23,"I adore the original 1971 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it is a true classic. The 2005 edition with Johnny Depp was okay but compared to this film it is a masterpiece of epic proportion.Chalamet does not do a great job as the titular character, it feels like he was overacting constantly. The story is strange and is hard to follow. The visuals may look attractive to some but personally I found them nauseating. The songs are terrible and forgettable, and there is an unnecessary amount of them. Very very few jokes land.Hugh Grant does an ok job but others did not perform here.Don't waste your money seeing this.","

Wonka," Willy Wonka's Musical Chocolate Melody Is Delicious
",SAMTHEBESTEST,06-Dec-23,"Wonka (2023) :
Movie Review -Wonka Review: So you must have read Roal Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (1964); you must have seen Gene Wilder's blockbuster ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) and then Tom Burton-Johnny Depp's mega hit ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2005), so now it's time for Timothée Chalamet's origin story of Willy Wonka with ""Wonka"" (2023). It's been almost seven decades, and the tale hasn't lost a bit of its magic. It's so enchanting, joyful, and colourful that all you need to do is handle it with your good skills. That's it. You have success in your hands because the source material is just too good. Comedy lover Paul King gets it right. Paul understood the assignment well. Wonka is an exhilarant, amusing, extremely engaging, musically vibrant, and full of chocolate entertainer that stays true to its origin and gives it a nice modern touch as well.Wonka is like a prequel to what you have seen in Wilder and Depp's movies. There you have a chocolate factory, and here the story takes you to the backstory before the factory was built. Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) is a youngster with the talent to make incredible chocolates. He isn't settled yet, though. Rather, he hasn't started his career. He keeps wandering the streets and halls and showcasing his talent for making chocolate that can instantly win people's tongues and stomachs. Since he is selling chocolates at cheap rates that even ""poor"" people can afford, the competitors sense the danger. They try their best to keep him out of the business in whatever way possible, and most of the time they succeed. Amidst his ambition of becoming a great chocolate maker, Wonka is scammed by a small hotel owner and is made her servant for years to come. With the help of Noodle/Nicole (Calah Lane) and other imprisoners, Wonka must find a way out and also set his business against the corrupt chocolate businessmen.First of all, Paul King has written a king-size entertainer for all age groups. The humour is organic, the gags are real, and the magical touch of Wonka's fantasy world makes this one very interesting and engaging. The musical numbers are also well written, as the lyrics have meaning to keep the mood going. Wonka's origin story is not old or outdated; rather, it's completely unknown for many, and that's why there are so many pleasant surprises in the movie. In the end, we see Wonka building the factory, which we all know, and you can connect dots very well there. We are short on good musical comedies nowadays, and thanks to Paul King for writing one that lives up to expectations. We had children, young males and females, and adults in our special show, and the comical segment had us all in splits at the time. I think that's just dandy. I was craving; I was drooling for chocolates by the end, and I wish I could enter the screen just like Mia Farrow did it in Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" (1985) and devour the mashmello and all the flavours. It's so freaking tasty.Timothée Chalamet is fantastic as Wonka. I wouldn't dare compare this young lad with legends like Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder, but yes, he is our Willy Wonka, alright. If those generations remember Wilder and Depp at that time, then let this social media generation remember Chalamet. Calah Lane is a sweet child with some adorable scenes, and she looks so cute in all of them. Paterson Joseph is not the deadly, cruel, but funnily cruel villain here that one would expect in a chocolate-comedy flick like this. There is something about his character that we miss in so many other musical comedies. Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton (that yuk ""poor"" joke was so rich) support him well. Keegan-Michael Key's transformation had the audience on a roll by the end. Our favourite Mr. Bean, Rowan Atkinson, is a desperate chocoholic, but who must have thought about giving his character the reference of a priest? I mean, it's so hilarious to know. The first frame of his had the audience hooting, and we all really wanted him to have more screen space. Jim Carter, Tom Davis, Olivia Colman, Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Natasha Rothwell, Rakhee Thakrar, Rich Fulcher, and others were fine in their supporting roles.Joby Talbot's songs have made Wonka extra delicious, and one can even go on tapping their feet in the cinema hall without even realising when that process begins, automatically. I was tapping my feet, and I didn't even realise it. Mark Everson's editing has literally no flaws. The only scene that looked slow and dated was when Noodle finds her mother, and then you have to think again to know how important that scene was for the film. Chung-hoon Chung's camera gives you some yummy frames of chocolate and whatnot. Roald Dahl's classic character needed a modern restoration on celluloid, and Paul King has given us that. Action, music, comedy, a little bit of a thrill, and an overflow of chocolates-that's what Paul serves you on the table in no time. Scrumptious is the word! ""You've never tasted chocolate like this,"" says Wonka in one of the songs, and I can assure you that he really meant it. This chocoholic musical melody deserves to be swallowed with tasty rashes on your tongue. There is no need to go to any chocolate shop; just visit the nearest cinema hall.RATING - 6/10*","

Wonka," Instantly forgettable
",superfox_888,22-Dec-23,"I LOVED the first half hour! It was magical, wonderful, Wonkatastic.Then it died soon after plot point 1 signalling Act 2. I should have listened to Hugh Grant's complaints about the film. It gets bogged in melodramatic sentimentality with forgettable songs. Reminded me of Hugh Jackman's The Greatest Showman at times. Every great idea starts as a dream, and there's no shortage of big ideas and daydreams here.Timothee Chalomet is a competent Wonka, but the dialogue did no favours. He'd say a Wonka-ism like, ""scratch that, reverse it""... and never utter it again. The other characters are forgettable sidekicks. As far as I can see, the Oompa Loompa was included just for continuity's sake and holds no narrative purpose. As mentioned Hugh Grant has been quite vocal in his criticism, saying he only took the role for the money. As an Oompa Loompa, I quite liked him.On the way out of the cinema, I listened to people around me. Not one kid liked it. A couple of adults did. Most just wanted chocolate.","

",vinsond21,08-Dec-23,"Finally, we can close this unremarkable year with a magical dose of Wonka, which will hopefully wash away the bad memories of the plasticity of Barbie and dreariness of Oppenheimer from the summer.Timothee Chalamet sings effortlessly the songs with clever lyrics by Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy. Give the Oscars to them both already.The production design and art direction provide a dazzling visual feast, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.For better or worse, Willy Wonka here is presented as sweet and warm and lovable although we know him as a much darker personality as played by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in the films based on Roald Dahl's book. This is the back story, so I guess he started off more innocently. But I still can't get over Timothee Chalamet's absolutely flawless performance. In this very challenging role which includes singing, his speech and demeanor are pitch perfect.So happy to end this dismal year on such a fabulous note!","

",b5fanatic,31-Jan-24,"Just saw Wonka. It's okay. But it's nothing like the Roald Dahl book. Nothing at all. It's like little orphan Annie, complete with most of her story in the og movie in the 80s, almost down to every plot line except the daddy warbucks. The orphan even delivers laundry and sneaks people in and out like Annie in the movie.And the horrible woman that owns her drinks gin. Sound familiar? She meets the magic chocolate man. I don't know why they didn't just call it Annie Meets The Magic Chocolatier. Though mildly entertaining, it's got none of the karma that Dahl brings and none of the comedy that Annie had. It's not very funny, and it's not very enchanting. It's meh.","

",albertozurro,07-Dec-23,"Does chocolate remind you of Christmas? Yes.Does a Dickensian city and poor people immediately take you back to a Christmas setting? Definitely.Do musicals recall you good old times with your acquaIntances? Absolutely.Ladies and gentlemen, that's 'Wonka'! A brilliant movie filled with magic. Chalamet delivers a wonderful performance, whose range of acting hugely widens with this role, from a 1920s clown like Chaplin to a 1950s charming dancer like Gene Kelly.I was especially delighted with the city's atmosphere, it's a Victorian London-like city. It's clear that Paul King knows how to bottle Christmas essence, mixing grayish pedestrian streets and brick buildings with goldish open malls. Watching this movie takes you back to the time when you were a child, and you walked hand in hand with your parents watching extravagant shopwindows displaying the finest products on Christmas.And what about the music? It's perfect! 'Oompah Loompah doompety do' won't get out of your head besides the fancy choreographies, every detail and nuance conveys a Christmas ambience. You can even taste the chocolate, slip with the iced flor covered in snow, smell the chestnuts, notice the smoke from the chimneys...
Finally, we're not even un mid-December ans ""it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas"" so please get yourself a hot chocolate mug get together with family and enjoy watching 'Wonka' because it will become a Christmas classic.","

Wonka," I think I owe Tim Burton an apology...
",robabwilliams,21-Jan-24,"I decided to check out this movie after all the hype with people giving it 9 and 10/10, but I honestly feel like I watched a completely different film. It was just bad, not even the ""so bad it's good"" kind of bad. The acting was alright (Hugh Grant was probably the highlight), and with an A-list cast and a high budget, there's no excuse for it to be this disappointing. The story, dialogue, and music were major letdowns. It felt like I was watching a local amateur production of a rejected Willy Wonka musical that couldn't make it to Broadway.The plot didn't make much sense; it was like someone asked ChatGPT to write a script for a Willy Wonka prequel. The film also struggled to decide whether it wanted to be British or American, making it a confusing mess. I was initially skeptical about a Willy Wonka prequel, especially after not being a fan of the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton remake, but after watching this, I think I owe Tim Burton an apology. The original Gene Wilder film was perfection, and this attempt again falls far short.","

Wonka," I'd say this is a success
",r96sk,13-Dec-23,"Enjoyed this!2023's 'Wonka' is very good! It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.Timothée Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.Tom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.Someone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.All in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).","

And I got some B rate orphans drama. Wonka is not him!

",henryhoooover,08-Dec-23,"This film is nothing like the older Willy Wonka films and is a huge disappointment. The story is altered a bit without giving too much away but it's not interesting enough to hold your attention. The acting is pretty average, although better in comparison to the other aspects of the film such as its humour. That's my next point, it's not funny at all. I maybe gave a little smile at 1 or 2 moments but that is all, which makes this film a failure as a comedy movie. The older Wonka films had much better humour and far better acting, therefore resulting in a much more enjoyable experience.The music is also distractingly irritating, and is certain to break windows. I regret seeing this and am dissapointed as I enjoyed the older films.Maybe young children will enjoy it but if you don't have any then I would give it a miss without a doubt.","

Wonka," Poor Choice in New Talent Ruins Prequel Attempt
",farthingtonwisemore,02-Jan-24,"Unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet's performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.The film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothy Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.One has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.","

Wonka," A bland tasteless experience
",Jsotosoto2,06-Jan-24,"Chalamet was the wrong casting choice for this role. Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp stepped into the larger than life role of Willy Wonka and gave the character substance and depth, a sense of something you could feel unfolding on screen. You were able to buy into their characters and believed that they actually were Willy Wonka. Unfortunately, Mr. Chalamet somehow managed to do the complete opposite. Almost every time he spoke or tried to add in a ""Wonka-esque"" quip I was immediately transported from the Wonka fantasy world to a realistic modern day one. My biggest complaint and reason why I will not recommend this movie to anyone is in large part due to the extremely lackluster songs and sense of low budget production. Low budget production? Yep, that's right. I was highly unimpressed with the feel, style, and overall vibe of the costumes, choreography, and sets. The entire thing felt rushed, thrown together, and in some inconcebible way like a high school production. I maybe laughed once during the whole movie and not even at one of the constant lame jokes. Multiple story lines that had nothing to do with Wonka himself created a sense of confusion and added to the jumbled up mess of the movie. I gave the movie 4 stars and the only reason was for the magnificent Rowan Atkinson. Also Hugh Grant was ok. Overall, this movie was such a huge disappointment it makes me want to go back and watch the originals just to make myself feel slightly better.","

There's no eccentricity or edginess to his character. He is not fit to lace Wilders boots. His sidekick noodle Is more wooden then my kitchen table.she has zero charisma. The entire English cast are overacting and beyond irritating. The musical scores must have been written by a 5 year old. Scrub scrub scrub. I'll scrub this movie out of my head very quickly.Nothing happens in the whole movie.its bland and soul less. I'm amazed by some of the rave reviews. Was I watching the same movie?I could write a book on how bad this movie was.I thought Barbie was bad, this runs it a very close second!","

Wonka," The beginnings of Willy Wonka in one of the best prequels in history
",Elvis-Del-Valle,12-Dec-23,"Years after Gene Wilder brought Willy Wonka to the big screen for the first time and after Johnny Depp played him, now the beloved chocolatier returns to recount his beginnings before creating the chocolate factory. The film tells a charming story that manages to maintain the essence of the 1971 film and update it in an excellent way. He presents us with an innocent and charming Willy Wonka who has that charisma and eccentricity that so characterizes the character. The movie shows Willy as a kind of magician and that's what he's always been since he first appeared in Roald Dahl's book or the original movie. Without a doubt, the actor manages to maintain the eccentricity of the character. Hugh Grant plays the first Oompa-Loompa that Willy met and the way he embodies this peculiar character is wonderful, making him striking. Even though short real actors were used in the original film and CGI was used here, they managed to keep the Oompa-Loompa's appearance and quirkiness intact. The film's musical numbers are a work of art and have the feel of the original film's soundtrack, making the musical scenes masterful. It is quite appreciated that some parts of the original soundtrack were also used. The acting, the production, the special effects, literally everything in this film is excellent, managing to respect the vision of the source of origin and making it a worthy successor to Dahl's work for perfectly capturing its magic. Wonka is definitely one of the best prequels in cinema history and a beautiful film to enjoy with the whole family. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.","

Wonka," Oompa Loompa Doopa Dee Doo, I have a movie for you.
",matitya-33937,01-Feb-24,"In case you're wondering, yes, I have read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. I greatly enjoyed it and its sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. And despite it sometimes deviating from the books, I love the 1971 movie with Peter Ostrum and Gene Wilder as Charlie and Willy Wonka. I wasn't a fan of the 2005 Willy Wonka movie (and I will not call it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) because even though it set itself up as a truer to the text readaptation of the book, it completely sacrificed to that for an origin story and character assassination of Willy Wonka which completely undermined the books and everything about them.Having said that, I went to the theatres with heavily managed expectations for this one and I z was surprised by the extent to which I loved it. Unlike the 2005 Willy Wonka movie, this didn't try to have its cake and eat it too. It was just his origin story and didn't attempt to splice that in with a new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory adaptation. And it does so brilliantly.Chalamet played Willy Wonka so well that I frequently forgot he was the same actor as Paul in the Dune remake. Wonka's found family relationship with Noodle was sweet and heartwarming. I greatly enjoyed the original songs and new dance sequences as well as the covers of pure imagination.Slugworth and the others were extremely memorable villains (and I would defend the race swap on the grounds that 1971 Slugworth was an imposter.) And indeed, quite a lot of the humour, in addition to being quite funny was the kind of humour you would see in a Roald Dahl book.There are three criticisms of this movie I feel compelled to refute. 1) But Willy Wonka isn't that heroic. (My answer:In the sequel he is) 2) Willy Wonka is way too trusting in this. (My answer: Yes and that's an actual plot point in this movie and it's worth noting that in the Chocolate Factory story, Willy Wonka's secrets were stolen from his factory by corporate spies already meaning that if the movie ends with him opening the factory then he shouldn't be that cynical yet.) 3) But this movie doesn't work with the Chocolate Factory lore. (My answer to that; It does if you read it as a prequel to the 1971 movie specifically and this film gives more than enough reason to believe that that's meant to be the case.)So in conclusion, I loved it.","

Wonka," ""Daydreaming Penalty: $3""
",moonspinner55,17-Dec-23,"The background story of candy-maker Willy Wonka, a child magician-turned-chocolate lover who arrives in a thriving metropolis and immediately runs afoul of lying/cheating/thieving chocolate sovereign Arthur Slugworth. Wonka (an illiterate!) is railroaded by evil hoteliers and is sentenced to work in the washer-room, where he befriends an urchin and conspires to usurp Slugworth with his delicious chocolates made with giraffe's milk. This CGI nightmare from director Paul King--targeted at restless kids raised on Taylor Swift videos--opens with the tinkling notes of ""Pure Imagination"" from 1971's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (and goes on to use that song plus ""The Oompa-Loompa Song""). That's a nice touch, yet the dreary action that takes place down in the dark brown-and-beige washer-room is enlivened only by the ""Scrub Scrub"" number. The plot, concocted by King and Simon Farnaby from King's original treatment, isn't involving: Wonka escapes to open his own shop--across the square from Slugworth's building--only to have his candy poisoned, causing the crowds to turn on him and burn the place down (the urchin solemnly tells Willy, ""We can rebuild"", while the audience likely asks, ""Can't that wait for the sequel?""). King's sense of humor is of the dryly dubious kind found in today's kids' movies, wherein wonderment and magic are greeted with eye-rolling skepticism. When crowds gather (and they do--at regular intervals), no one is overly-surprised when magic chocolates make Slugworth and his flunkies levitate. This is a movie about wonderment without any wonder in it--the whiplash editing eliminates it. In the lead, red-nosed Timothée Chalamet doesn't possess a strong singing or speaking voice--nor, indeed, a strong visual presence (he's forgettable in the role). Some of the supporting players are marginally better, though the casting of Paterson Joseph as the lips-pursing Slugworth doesn't pay off (he's whispery-intimidating but drip-dry and vacant, like the pimps in the blaxploitation movies). The CGI will probably please those who can't get along without it, but it looks cheap when focusing on Hugh Grant as Wonka's chocolate-stealing nemesis; we can't get an idea of this Oompa-Loompa's size, which seems to change, nor his personality (he's brash and yet benign). The intermittent musical numbers give the film a bit of a lift, but not enough, and a vengeful plan for Wonka that lands him in a rising pool of chocolate (""Death by chocolate!"") puts a damper on the whole thing. ** from ****","

Wonka," Underwhelming bright shiny wrappers but a dull centre
",tm-sheehan,14-Dec-23,"My Review- Wonka
My Score 6/10I don't mind sequels and prequels if they achieve something original or unique but I felt that Roald Dahl would have been totally unimpressed with this cliche overload musical confectionery.I'm a lover of musicals and great children's stories but not this movie in fact as much as I enjoyed Timothée Chalamet's characterisation of young Willy Wonker pre his Chocolate factory I was bored .Even though at times some of the musical numbers are spectacular I kept thinking this is just another attempt to make a cash cow out of an iconic character .I kept thinking I've seen this character before they are just borrowing from old musicals like Oliver or Annie .The plot is very different to Roald Dahl's backstory to Willy Wonker who he wrote was the son of his hometown's local dentist, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. This unfortunately made Willy not allowed to eat chocolate and sweets, and he eventually ran away from home, later starting up his chocolate business from a single shop to a gigantic factory.In this Wonker movie Willy is an aspiring magician, inventor and chocolatier who arrives by boat to an unnamed European city to fulfil his dream of opening his chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He decides to stay at a laundromat after he becomes penniless where he meets the devious Mrs. Scrubbit and her henchman Bleacher who run a sweatshop laundry exploiting their workers.The three other villains are three chocolatiers named Mr. Slugworth, Mr. Prodnose and Mr. Fickelgruber who mock Wonka's chocolates .They scheme together and call the corrupt Chief of Police to confiscate Willy's earnings for the day and continue to thwart his ambitions which if realised would ruin theirs.Wonka is another huge budget movie estimated at $125 million which may or may not succeed I hope it does but it didn't with me and I really wonder what audience demographic this movie is aimed at ?I doubt it would entertain or hold the interest of children under 13 and I also doubt anyone over that age would get much entertainment out of it other than some good performances and a star studded cast.I enjoyed the 2 Paddington movies that Simon Farnaby and Paul King who also is the director of Wonker made but I feel have missed the mark in this movie .To many new characters come flying in and out in all directions but don't seem to add much to the story . Perhaps it just that Roald Dahl had said it all in 1964 in his novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which has already been adapted as a stage musical book by David Greig, music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Mark Shaiman and Scott Wittman.Joby Talbot the composer of Wonka has written a few good songs for the movie but nothing that I'd say would be remembered certainly no where near quality of the Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley score for Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory which produced The Candy Man and Pure Imagination which is also used in the finale of Wonker.The ensemble cast is impressive and full of big names like Olivia Colman as Mrs Scrubbit , Matt Lucas as Prodnose , Hugh Grant as Oopa Loompa Guard 1, Sally Hawkins as Willy
Wonka's mum ,Rowan Atkinson as Father Julius and Jim Carter as Abscus Crunch.They are all fun to watch for a while but I found the overall experience of Wonka irritating.Unlike the superb 2018 sequel to Mary Poppins Mary Poppins Returns Wonka for me added nothing to the wonderful Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory movie of 1971 starring Gene Wilder .However I will say top marks to Timothée Chalamet who impresses me more and more in his movie career. He is worth seeing in this movie as he sings and dances giving an elfish charm to his character in what for me is a lacklustre movie.This chocoholic got saccharine overload in a movie with to many bright wrappers and to many soft centres.","

Wonka," Weirdos and strangers have the best candy!
",Coventry,09-Jan-24,"Before, throughout, and after watching ""Wonka"", there was just one question spooking through my head: What would Roald Dahl think of it? Dahl was a genius, and he's in my top three of favorite authors/personal heroes, but he was also known to be a very skeptical and grumpy person when it came to film adaptations of his books. ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) and ""The Witches"" (1990) were two successful and widely acclaimed film-versions of children's novels of his, but the author himself hated them. I honestly wonder what Dahl would say about a spinoff/prequel of one of the most mysterious characters he invented.We'll never know, sadly, and obviously I never knew him personally, but somehow, I like to believe that Roald Dahl would have appreciated the colorful and excessively imaginative background story that is given here to his chocolate maker Willy Wonka! Enough about the writer, though, what did I think of it? Well, I watched it at the cinema, together with my 8-year-old daughter, and we both loved it. Could have done with a little less singing, perhaps, but it's a joyous and stimulating spectacle that is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face from start to finish.If anything, ""Wonka"" is loyal to the flamboyant mindset of Roald Dahl. It's absurd without being ridiculous, it's child-friendly without being childish, it's impossible but simultaneously fascinating, and you'll be getting a couple of unusually wrapped but valuable life-lessons along the way. Willy Wonka is a naive but very optimistic young man who arrives in a Mediterranean city with the dream of opening a candy store. He learns about life the hard way, as bad luck and sabotage pursues him, but Willy never loses his optimism and finds good-hearted allies. I really don't want to write too much about the plot, as it's more than worth discovering and experiencing.I had confidence this would be a good film, and this solely based on how the duo Paul King and Simon Farnaby previously handled the adorable ""Paddington"" films. They do make use of digital and CGI effects a lot, but it's due to the story being grotesque and fantasy-like. The performances are excellent. I have great admiration for Timothy Chalamet who doesn't depict Willy Wonka quite as eccentric as Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder did in the past, but nevertheless finds the character's right balance between pleasantly deranged and unworldliness. Hugh Grant is hilarious, although allegedly he didn't enjoy it much. At the end, all the dots nicely fit into the legacy of Roald Dahl, and I think that's beautiful.","

Recreating the Wonka persona doesn't work for me. As a character it was just too far removed from what I remember as a child.Children with no knowledge of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory will probably enjoy this as a stand alone movie but some things should just be left alone.Looking at cast, and the director, this movie should be much better than it is, but falls well short. Doubled up with the most talkative and disrespectful crowd I've experienced in the cinema meant there was no joy from me.","

Wonka," A sweet treat!
",Anurag-Shetty,11-Dec-23,"Wonka tells the origin story of Willy Wonka(Timothee Chalamet), the iconic chocolatier from Roald Dahl's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Despite being broke, a young Willy Wonka aspires to open the best chocolate shop in the world. However, he finds out that the chocolate industry is run by a cabal of chocolatiers, who are drunk with power.Wonka is an excellent film. Director Paul King has given us a movie that is hilarious, endearing, has a few catchy songs & above all, is super entertaining. The set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are perfect. Watching all of Willy Wonka's magical & delicious chocolates come to life on the big screen, is an absolute joy to watch. Timothee Chalamet is spectacular as Willy Wonka. Chalamet gives us another unforgettable performance, this time in a light-hearted role, that shows his incredible versatility. Calah Lane is outstanding as Noodle. Olivia Colman & Tom Davis are awe-inspiring as Mrs. Scrubbit & Bleacher, respectively. Keegan Michael-Key is hysterical as the Chief of Police. Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas & Mathew Baynton are perfect as Slugworth, Prodnose & Fickelgruber, respectively. Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, Rakhee Thakrar, Natasha Rothwell, Rich Fulcher, Colin O'Brien & Sally Hawkins are perfect as the Oompa-Loompa, Father Julius, Abacus Crunch, Lottie Bell, Piper Benz, Larry Chucklesworth, Young Willy Wonka & Willy's Mother, respectively. Wonka is a must watch for chocolate lovers & fans of Roald Dahl's source material & its two previous big screen adaptations. Watch it & have a whale of a time, with a guaranteed craving for chocolate, once the credits roll!","

It could have been bright and fun throughout.But instead they went with a negative and dark tone.Still, the main actor was terrific as Wonka.","

",Couchkik20,11-Dec-23,"Wonka is an amazing piece of entertainment reminiscent of old Hollywood when spectacle and awe truly meant something.The secret is that it is a cartoon made in live action. The tone, the musicality, the over-the-top acting and characters, everything has the sweetness and joy of an animated movie.The story is the emotional and musical journey of a very naive but smart character in the true spirit of Roal Dahl. It blends humor, drama and a baroque sense of insanity that wraps you with childlike excitement.Timothée Chalamet nails the complex Wonka by playing it in all seriousness and embracing the silliness like a male Mary Poppins.Paul King uses the 1940s love of dramatic shots, crazy colors and retro choreographies to fill his movie with fascinating set pieces. The shop scene is fabulous and just an example of the incredible attention to details : the right combination of digital and reality. Disney could learn a thing or two from it. Of course if you're familiar with the Paddington movies you will recognize story beats, aesthetic elements and an obsession with heist scenarios but it works for the best. As an incredible rollercoaster of old school fun,
Wonka will melt your heart.","

Wonka," Pedestrian Songs
",steve-32979,14-Jan-24,"There were some bight spots but overall I found the film disappointing. The stellar cast helped but sadly couldn't save it. The songs were predictable and pedestrian. The inclusion of songs from the original showed up how ordinary they were. They could have come from a round in 'Who's Line'. I am loving Hugh Grant's return to form but I think he was let down by poor special effects that didn't allow his character to develop. Considering the film was entirely shot in the UK, some of the Milan substitute buildings were spectacular. I feel bad marking this so low but a bit more effort in the musical department was required.","

Wonka," Quiet up, and listen down
",TheVictoriousV,18-Dec-23,"Roald Dahl once wrote that he found Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka in 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to be a way too ""sappy and saccharine"" version of the character he first envisioned. Well, if that one was ""a bit too much"", Dahl is lucky to have passed away before he could witness the Timothée Chalamet version.Here is a Wonka who is full of cheer and whimsy. Being that it's a prequel, I guess we are to understand that this is set before he adopted more kooky and sinister traits, ergo this isn't quite the Wonka we know. The real issue, perhaps, is the casting. Chalamet can be dark and brooding (Dune), and a little creepy if he needs to (Bones and All), but having him dial up the whimsy feels off.Of course, I also believe that there's a missed opportunity here. A while ago, with regards to FXP's The Bear, I wrote this: ""When Timothée Chalamet was cast for the upcoming Willy Wonka prequel, many TV nerds pointed out that they could've gone with Jeremy Allen White if they wanted someone who has a sort of Chalamet energy to him, but actually LOOKS like a younger Gene Wilder, supposing that's the Wonka they were going for. ... Having watched the show that put White on the map, I see it even more. It's like they had some kind of character customization slider with Wilder on one end and Chalamet on the other and cranked it all the way up to Chalamet when they could've left it in the middle and gotten White.""Ultimately, however, I warmed up to Chalamet as the picture went along. His singing isn't always great, yet there is an earnestness to it all that seems to have won critics over. Indeed, as if this year in movies wasn't already wild enough, it now closes out with the revelation that, yeah, even the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fan-fic prequel is a part of the ""cinema is back"" club. It's good -- for the most part.Perhaps we were foolish to presume that a Willy Wonka musical as done by the man behind Paddington -- boasting a cast of such names as Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Colman -- would be mere soulless IP nostalgia bait, especially in the year when Hollywood pictures of that ilk finally would begin to f*ck off. (So starved indeed were people for anything other than the usual slop, with its green-screened everything and persistent key-jangling, that even the return of the Saw franchise, itself more ""on fire"" than before, was cause for more jubilation than, say, most of Disney's output in 2023.) Sure enough, Wonka has more lively and well-staged musical numbers than any of Disney's recent remakes and is unabashedly colorful to look at.I maintain that some aspects looked unpromising as the trailers came out and that the final product is flawed, but this was still a joyous viewing that certainly left me in the mood for some exotic sweets.One still baffling element is the casting of Wonka's first Oompa-Loompa. Instead of a little-person actor, it's Hugh Grant's head on a small body. I understand if little people would find this sort of role demeaning (or if Peter Dinklage's comments about the exploitation of little people made studios less willing to cast little-person performers in roles like this, ironically making the landscape more difficult for the group he sought to protect as they now get even less work), but this isn't really a sight one gets used to.Lastly, allow me to once more evoke David Ehrlich with the following musing: ""There's a delicious irony to the fact that Warner Bros.' first big release since Discovery CEO David Zaslav (once again) canned a completed film in exchange for a $30 million tax write-off is an anti-capitalist fable set in a city run by a ruthless chocolate cartel who've diluted their own product in order to hoard the profits."" Hollywood will never be perfect, but sometimes, as with the year 2023, it lets out more gold than usual. Golden tickets, if you will? No? Okay.","

Olivia Colman and Calah Lane are excellent all along, as is Timothée Chalamet, who once again rises to the challenges of his role. Of course, many will be unable to resist making comparisons with Johnny Depp's previous performance, but in my opinion, Mr. Chalamet has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. A perfect Christmas film for young and less young curious ones!","

Wonka," Not a prequel. It is a standalone in its own Wonka universe.
",samnaji-15383,15-Dec-23,"A prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an enticing idea, especially if the film is a prequel to either the 1971 or 2005 film. It should not be a difficult endeavour provided there is consistency to one film or the other. The problem I found with this film is that the setting has the Germanic vibe of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but Timothee Chalamet is channeling Johnny Depp from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Apart from the Johnny Depp's Wonka impersonation, there is nothing in this film that is related to that 2005 film. The backstory of the dentist father and the origins of the oompa loompa are dropped for something different. Shame. I would have liked it if this film was set in that universe. To add to the disappointment we did not get a story that is set in the 1971 universe either as the character of Slugworth and the people are completely different as well. Put it this way it is a film very much for 2023. I mean if you are going to do a prequel, at least try and be consistent with that 1971 universe.There are some positives. I found Timothee Chalamet charming and a great fit for the role. Some of the jokes landed, but not enough to warrant a comedy (in the full house I saw it in, no one laughed out once). Paterson Joseph was fantastic as the villainous Slugworth. It was also great to see Tom Davis get more screen time (a very underrated actor). Hugh Grant was probably the best bit of the film and it is a shame we did not get more of him. The dancing was also fun to watch.Unfortunately, for me, most of the songs did not land. The story was also lame and the character of this young Wonka did not gel with the craggy, somewhat mean, reclusive character we know when his chocolate ideas get stolen. To be honest I was somewhat bored by it. I checked the time twice as I felt it was 20 minutes too long.It is not a film I would see twice after loving the first two movies. I came away disappointed as it was not the prequel I had hoped to see.","

Wonka," A sour experience
",harhouflo,02-Jan-24,"I really wanted to like this flick, even so, I went to the theatre with relative low expectations. Well, I should have even lowered them further. So far, enough has been said about the music. About how bad it is; and it really is bad, with just very few exceptions. I could have looked beyond that fact, being a musician myself I try to be less critical, a bit more open minded when it comes to musical numbers in movies. But in Wonka that's hard to ignore as it was just one bad song after another, sometimes crippling the already crippled super-predictible storytelling. Obviously the whole story is about Wonka but more depth often is added to other characters. You like them, you feel for them, you want them to succeed. I didn't care much for any other character, neither did my kids, they didn't care much for Noodles either. All of them seemed shallow and boring, including the villains, perhaps even Wonka himself, as I felt we were all waiting for the moment his personality would flourish and make us root for him till the end. Instead, it was more like looking forward for it to be over.In my sons's own words ""The scenery was great, the story...meh!"". In my teenage daughters' words ""this is so cringe"" (she still thinks Chalamet is very cute though). To be fair, there's very little in life teenagers don't find cringe. But this is coming form a couple of Willy Wonka movie fans, they both love and still watch the Wilder and Depp's versions. This one they said they're OK not to watch it ever again.It felt to me at times like I was watching a TV musical presentation or episode, where you kind of expect mediocre numbers and flat storytelling, because that is exactly what Wonka was. Sadly there's not a whole lot to choose from at the theatres right now and we had seen previews for Wonka that seemed promising, we all felt let down.","

Wonka," Roald Dahl in the corporate era
",movie-reviews-uk,25-Dec-23,"I'd been hearing many excellent things about ""Wonka"" in the run up to this Christmas and figured that it would make excellent Christmas Eve entertainment. I wasn't wrong. The film is entertaining, enjoyable and easy to watch. There's very little here to offend anyone.Which is rather the point of Roald Dahl. His stories always carried a quite malevolent edge, a real tangible darkness where bad things happened. This is what made his stories so great - they never shielded you from reality despite being based in fantasy.Sadly ""Wonka"" has none of that magic. Instead Willy Wonka is simply someone who wishes to bring joy to the world and that's basically what happens despite the dastardly dealings of the baddies arrayed against him. It's all very simplistic and not particularly memorable.On the plus side the film looks great, it's very well made and the bad guys really are the most awful caricatures. There are quite a few familiar faces from the British TV and film universe and they all put in a good effort. It's just a shame that the script isn't worth the sweat.Still the younger kids will certainly enjoy ""Wonka"" with its wild array of chocolates and sweets. They should enjoy the musical numbers too as they're very slick and professional. But this isn't a Christmas classic in the making I'm afraid.","

It was a movie that mabye had a somewhat good story but there were songs every 5 minutes and they were so predictible that me and my friend could predict every one.There were no good joles all of them were too old or just too bad to consider a GOOD joke.There were also good charecters but there were to much bad ones to go with them.There are some poor trys at teaching some lessons like don't trust stranges and such but it wasn't some good trys and it is obviously made for children of younger age allthou it is 12+

Wonka," Entertaining enough
",nightwishouge,10-Feb-24,"Based on the previews, I desperately wished to avoid seeing this movie. But my girlfriend's little brother wanted to go, so hey, free popcorn. I was rewarded with a film that is suitably okay and occasionally pretty good.This is the origin story of Willy Wonka--so beholden to the 1971 version that it reuses its songs, but apparently not intended to be a canonical prequel. This Wonka is kind and magnanimous to a fault, a pure being who only wishes to inspire joy and imagination through his magical confections. It's difficult to imagine this character growing into the cynical, eccentric, and occasionally sadistic recluse Gene Wilder played. Wonka's relationship with the Oompa Loompa (Hugh Grant in a scene-stealing performance) seems carefully constructed to avoid invoking the residue of enslavement that hangs over the novel and its other adaptations. In a way, creating a backstory for a character like Wonka is as foolhardy as trying to set the Joker's origins in stone--he just works better when he's nine-tenths mystery--but the filmmakers establish so firmly early on that they're doing THEIR OWN THING that you never really feel like they're cheapening the classic interpretation of the character by over-explaining him. This is almost more of a parallel universe story, a what-if, a big-budget fan fiction that takes what it wants from the source material and doesn't sweat the rest of it.The acting is variable. I've enjoyed Chalamet in everything else I've seen him in, but his performance as Wonka is a touch too ""musical theater kid"". I suppose it's good that he's having fun, smiling and dancing with a kind of sexless energy that conveys to the audience, ""I'm not a threat!"" But it doesn't exactly make for a character with depth. Given that this is generally meant to be a fairy tale, I suppose it's all right to play a superficial archetype, but there were times when the character felt ""vacuous"" as opposed to ""relentlessly optimistic"". Olivia Colman and Tom Davis are a lot of fun as the unscrupulous owners of a sweatshop laundromat--very Roald-Dahl-esque in their playful grotesqueness. (Fan fiction prompt: What if Willy Wonka met Sweeney Todd? But keep it PG, please.) Calah Lane is unfortunately rather flat as Noodle, the obligatory sad-eyed orphan. Perhaps the writing failed her, perhaps it's that Chalamet was only giving her a single note to play against, but I found her lacking in charisma, which makes her character very slight and difficult to really invest in, which in turn hampered the sweetness of the ending. Everybody else is suitable to their roles.The biggest problem with Wonka is that it never really soars as a musical. The numbers are perhaps entertaining in the moment, but the staging often feels unimaginative and the music is forgettable. The only tunes you'll be humming on the way out of the theater are the standards from the '71 version. It almost feels as though the filmmakers made a straight narrative film and some studio head saw the result and was like, ""No songs? But the audience will expect songs in a Wonka movie! Quick, go shoot a few."" The third act pretty much eschews musical numbers altogether until the (underwhelming) reprise of ""Imagination"". Everything feels weightless and inconsequential the moment the characters start belting out a ditty, and the excess of CGI doesn't help. The movie works a lot better as a gentle comedy--pleasantly formulaic, at times emotional, and occasionally even whimsical.Wonka is no Paddington, but there's enough to put in the Plus column that I look forward to director Paul King's next endeavor.","

Wonka," Very average but worth a watch
",samhinchliffe-70241,31-Dec-23,"Felt this was more about the girl noodle than Willy Wonka. I was hoping to watch his struggle in getting the chocolate factory. Rather we have a film about him being trapped and having to sneak out with a girl. Pretty poor origin story he was the sub character, which was a huge mistake.But saying that it still had me laughing in parts. The casting was spot on which is rare nowadays. Again apart from noodle who I didn't really care about, and it got tired fast. Hugh Grant was great but wasn't in it nearly enough. Timothy was the perfect casting, they couldn't have found anybody else more perfect for the role. Worth a watch but I feel like it was a massive missed opportunity. Why involve noodle so much, absolutely no need for this.","

Doesn't even slightly match, looks awful.Songs are very lacking, not catchy or enjoyable, missing the right feel.

Wonka," Superb cast with music and lyrics that fall short
",rjsullivanjr,08-Jan-24,"It's wonderful to look at. The cast is accomplished and engaged; however, the music is mediocre and the lyrics don't have the edginess and zest that one associates with Dahl and his Wonka worlds (Charlie and C. F/Great Glass Elevator, etc.).Funniest line, by a mile, is Rowan Atkinson answering the phone: ""Pulpit!""In a two hour picture though, that makes for a massive shortage of memorable lines.The indentured servants in the washing factory lack sufficient backstory for us to care about their fates. Not to mention Wonka's own hazy background -- how does he wield magic so effortlessly? A better history of the chocolate ""cartel"" might have made those enemies more daunting instead of bumbling foils. The story is a mess. I feel for Mr. Chalamet who throws himself into a part that doesn't really find the beating heart of the Wonka mystique.","

Wonka," An Enjoyable and visually stunning musical
",lisafordeay,10-Dec-23,"Wonka is a 2023 musical fantasy starring Timothy Chalamet,Hugh Grant,Jim Carter,Olivia Coleman,Keegan Michael Key and Matt Lucas. Directed by Paul King(Paddington),the story tells the tale of Willy Wonka(Chalamet) who dreams of opening up his own chocolate store. But he ends up being stuck in a bnb owned by an evil couple (Coleman)who uses their guests as slaves. So Willy decides to make his dream a reality by asking the slaves to help him create a chocolate store in spit of the evil chocolaters and of course the evil couple. Will he succeed in his dreams?.Overall I enjoyed this film. The songs are good but not as memorable as say The Greatest Showman(they are more like Mary Poppins Returns)and the story has been done before so many times. Hugh Grant had me in stitches throughout as the Oompa Loompa.If you enjoyed Mary Poppins Returns or The Greatest Showman then you'll love this film. Also features Rowan Atkinson as a priest.","

",iamthemusicman14,10-Dec-23,"What is wrong with people nowadays, why all the bad reviews?!This movie is fantastic!The music is excellently crafted and perfectly performed by all.The humour is brilliant, I have never been in a cinema where everyone has laughed out loud, not just children but fully grown adults as well, laughing at a ""children's film"", as I keep seeing in a lot of the reviews on here saying.In my opinion there is no such thing as a children's film but instead films that are appropriate for children to watch but ultimately are for everyone to enjoy.It is my belief that ""grownups"" need to calm down and realise that not every film needs to be a gritty drama, blockbuster saga or a dirty comedy to be considered a great movie for adults to enjoy, let your guard down and just enjoy films like you used to before we all became adults with a singular cynical view of the world why can't we just be happy with lighthearted musical movies, why must we bash them just because its seems to be the way to keep within the in crowd.This movie had me crying with pure joy, with moments of sadness, and with the sheer lyrical talent coupled with the musical brilliance of this movie musical that we haven't seen the likes of in decades!Please ignore the negative reviews and let yourself enjoy this brilliant film uninhabited by what types of films you ""should"" enjoy.","

",kosmasp,12-Dec-23,"As in chocolate and ing ... well something. Anyway, no pun intended. And a musical again - you may say, like I did. Not really something I was looking forward to. And yet the movie got to me ... it really is a feel good movie and it really works. With all the ridiculous and enhancements and caricatures it is drawing. I mean talk about evil ... it relishes in it! The actors turn it up to 11 more than once.But they know what they are doing - they do not have to be reigned in. No sir - although I assume the director had a leash on some of the things ... he had to have, right? Considering all the small details added to the movie I will go ahead and say yes.While I was a bit skeptic, the movie had me quite early. Yes you could make cases about how ""kid friendly"" this is (stunts from the start, as in do not try this at home, riding on top of a car, jumping of it), but it is quite clear that the movie is fantasy. And I think kids can tell too, without wanting to do things they see ... and arent't we all addicted to chocolate already? I'd say the answer is quite ... well revealing ... I mean obvious! Also you get to see one character change physically ... so there is that too.This may be too sweet ... if there is such a thing ... and a pun you would be able to forgive ... now on to watch the 70s movie soon ... never got around to that ... until now, this being a prequel, it should work nicely.","

",PennyReviews,11-Dec-23,"'' Wonka '' is a musical taking inspiration of the 1971 version of the book adaption of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, serving as a prequel to the well known story. And trully, King does what King did in Pandington: give a heartwarming, enjoyable fairtale that pleases both adult and younger audiences.First of all, the songs were enjoyable, well performed, with entertaining dancing sequences, and witty lyrics. The costumes and CGI were all great as well, creating the right atmosphere for the story to be properly unfold.As for the story itself, it is pleasant, though, some scenes were a bit too much and a bit cheesy, and the progress of the plot was predictable as well. But the overall result was entertaining and heartwarming.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.","

Wonka," A giddy, lighthearted, funny, charming, and classic adventure!
",Bibliophile100,15-Dec-23,"Just got back from this on its opening release date with my Mom! I absolutely ADORED it!!!The story: Willy Wonka, a magician/inventor/chocolatier arrives in an old English city with a happy hopeful dream: selling chocolate and spreading magic and happiness to all of the townsfolk! However, three other pride and greed infested chocolatiers, Ficklegruber, Prodnose, and Slugworth (collectively knows as The Chocolate Cartel) are instantly consumed with jealousy and annoyance at Wonka's work, and decide to try and crush his dreams. Luckily, with a group of wishy-washy washers from a hard labored laundry business, Wonka might have just the friends he needs to succeed, and make his Mama proud!The cast was an excellent, interesting choice of actors; each actor had the perfect mood to fit their character in different situations in the film. I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and Olivia Colman's performances the best; they really made me laugh!The film had a nice lighthearted, cheery, and humorous tone to it. A little something for adults, and children. I felt constant giddiness throughout the film! Sets and effects were pretty neat as well. The musical numbers, were outstanding! For each situation in the film, there was an excellent song to go with it! My favorite songs were ""You've never had a Chocolate like This"", and ""A World of your Own"". Plus, as respect payment for the 1971 version, the Oompa-Loompa song, and ""Pure Imagination"" were also featured, with brand new clever lyrics!Overall, this was one of the most happy, funny, exciting, descriptive, detailed, and clever musicals I've ever seen!! I've never felt such giddiness, joy, cheerfulness, and happiness at the movie theater before!! I actually felt like I was a kid again, skipping down the theater steps with my Mom, still singing ""A World of your Own"". I truly cherished Wonka! DON'T miss it!! And if you get the chance, take the kids along too! You'll all have a scrumdidilyumptiously delicious time!!","

This is like Solo, it answers questions no reasonable viewer would have. The top review right now mentions it's a cash grab in the first sentence. That's correct.

",c_hookham,25-Dec-23,"Sometimes films remind you what the point of making films actually is. This is one of them.From the writing/Directing partnership behind Paddington 2 comes Willy Wonka's backstory full of whimsy, laughs and 1st class music and songs.Here we see the titular character arrive in the unspecified vaguely Germanic country of the original film where he's tricked into a life of servitude by Tom Davis and Olivia Colman's wonderfully hissable laundry owners. Here he meets his fellow serfs but sets about founding his confectionery empire in the face of some stiff competition led by the brilliant Paterson Jospeh as well as leading his friends to freedom.The songs by the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon and Joby Talbot are a particular high point, with For A Moment easily the best of the bunch. Chalamet is a great, wide eyed and slightly mad early incarnation of the chocolatier with a singing voice to match.Some beautiful set pieces and lots of laughs make this a top class festive treat.","

The humor is tacky and more aiming for the children audience. The musical sequences i did find to be quite forgettable. It was hard to feel emotional with the characters.

Wonka," Amazing OST and Performances
",Wildlost,06-Dec-23,"Spectacular production, wonderful casting and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. I was simply blown away by so many amazing original songs and performances, and there was a good balance of comedy and drama that would appeal to the whole family.Having only seen a movie poster of Wonka, I did not have much to go on. I did not even know it was a musical until the movie started, and then, I was engaged from beginning to end.From the playful glint in his eyes to his quirky smiles and cane-twirling sequences, Timothee Chalamet's whimsical performance gives nods to both Johnny Depp's and Gene Wilder's earlier depictions of Wonka, while still adding his own spin and spice (and all things nice) to the young Wonka he plays.There is a purity and crispness in Chalamet's delivery of both script and song that encapsulates that sense of wonder a young Willy Wonka manages to hold on to through the formative years of his youth, despite all the setbacks and hardships that befalls him. And this is key because it carries over into his later years, and it is the re-imagining through this lens of childlike innocence that inspires audiences around the world to have hope and dare to dream again.Special mention to Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa, who delivers his lines in perfect matter-of-fact British fashion. My niece liked his performance so much, she was singing Oompa Loompa all the way home, while I tried to sway her to sing Pure Imagination instead.If there is one movie to catch this Christmas with your loved ones, this should be it!

It's also a musical. Timothee arrives in a little town that is known for it's chocolate makers, to set up his own little chocolate shop.

Wonka," Fabulous and Perhaps Unexpected Gem of 2023
",ThereelscoopwithKK,28-Dec-23,"This may be my favourite movie of 2023. Based on the trailer I had very low expectations. Thankfully, unlike most trailers nowadays, it saved a lot of its juice for the actual film. The casting for this movie was perfection. Each character brings a magic to their role necessary to make this kind of film work.I was a bit concerned with the opening scene leading off immediately with a song and wondering if I'd just gone to a movie solely meant for 5 year olds. However, it sets the stage for the rest of what is a beautifully crafted family movie with excellent messaging and characters that grow on you more and more as the movie develops. The role of Wonka had high demands and Timothée Chalamet meets them. He's charming and his demeanour fits that of a young Gene Wilder version of Wonka. The supporting cast and villains are spectacular as well. There was no point where I felt bored or felt that scenes were included that didn't serve a purpose.Perhaps the best asset this movie has is that it has natural unforced comedy. So much of what's meant to be funny nowadays in movies is just so bland or overused. Wonka offers something new I haven't seen in years.Overall Wonka combines excellent character development, comedic relief, plot development, strong visuals, and a magical setting which only further elevates the superb performances. Most films these days are lucky if they are able to achieve just 2 of the above in one film.Huge thumbs up to all involved in the creation of this movie. Prequels are almost always a let down , but this one hits just right.See it in theatres if you can !","

My only complaint is that I watched the trailer beforehand and there was no indication of this movie being a musical which is frustrating when you go to the theatre expecting one thing and you get something completely different. Why can't trailers just say it's a musical?? I probably wouldn't have gotten tickets if I had known that. Despite it being a musical I did enjoy the movie but I probably wouldn't watch it again. It had some good moments but the signing was a bit corny at times. If you don't like musicals I would avoid this movie or maybe wait for it to come out on streaming so you can skip through the singing bits.,"

Wonka," PUZZLING BUT ENTERTAINING
",Sunsphxsuns,06-Jan-24,"About halfway into Wonka (2023) I began wondering if ""reimagining"" classic films is always a good idea. Do we really need another Casablanca (1942) or Gone With the Wind (1939)? Does Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (painted between 1503-1509) truly need ""CGI"" and other digital effects to enhance her iconic smile? I don't think so. Yet, there seems to be a lack of wonderfully original scripts in Hollywood. If that's not true, then why else would film companies continue to tamper with that which has already been wonderfully done? Perhaps it is because Wonka is a pre-sold property. It already has several generations of fans to bolster the box office receipts. After all, film making may be a fascinating art form, but at the end of the day, it is still a business with a bottom line.To its credit, Wonka offers a clever back story of Willie's origins. The film also introduces us to several new songs, some of which, are quite memorable, but not nearly as much as the reboot of the wistful tune, ""Pure Imagination."" One thinks of the late Gene Wilder even as Timothée Chalamet performs a very capable version on the screen. Chalamet is very charming, of course (he's a tremendous actor), yet the character is not written nearly as cynically as Wilder's 1971 portrayal. Indeed, even the brooding darkness in Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) is absent here. Wonka is far more optimistic than its two predecessors, though perhaps that is not a bad thing, especially for younger audiences.For the most part, ""Wonka"" is visually entertaining and hits several high marks one would expect for a film that had a $125,000,000 budget. It's an elegant enterprise to be sure, but nevertheless has some very BIG shoes to fill.No spoilers here as usual, but I can share that Timothée Chalamet reportedly was constantly sick during production as a result of having to eat an extraordinary amount of chocolate and candy.","

Wonka," A consistently entertaining musical fantasy origin story of Willy Wonka
",bastille-852-731547,17-Dec-23,"While I cannot say we definitively needed a prequel establishing the foundation of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, I still was looking forward to this film because of Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and having grown up with and enjoyed Roald Dahl's books. While far from perfect, ""Wonka"" should satisfy families looking for a good time at the movies this holiday season. The film may contain fewer direct tie-ins to Dahl's book than some viewers might expect; however, the whimsy and exaggerated humor of Dahl's writing is very present this story in enthralling and clever ways. The film centers around the conflicts that ensue when Willy Wonka wants to open his own chocolate shop, but realizes that the chocolate industry is heavily monopolized by a ""chocolate cartel"" of corrupt influencers.The film's aesthetics are unique compared to the 1971 Gene Wilder film and the 2005 Johnny Depp film (which also makes sense given the prequel nature,) but they are still very engaging. In particular, the production design of a wintry European city is frequently gorgeous, with excellent cinematography integrated with practical visual effects. Timothee Chalamet is great as Willy Wonka, although his singing during the musical numbers isn't anything exceptional. Yet his charisma fully inhabits the role to make an earnest and endearing character. The supporting characters are mostly underused except for the orphan girl Noodle. Hugh Grant has limited screentime as an Oompah-Loompa, but he does steal the show in every scene he's in. The overarching story of ""Wonka"" is a bit on the formulaic and sentimental side, but Chalamet's acting, enjoyable musical numbers and scrumptious production values make this a sweet and deftly paced treat for both kids and adults. Recommended. 7/10Note: I saw the film in The Big Show, Alamo Drafthouse's premium format screen. The picture and sound quality were very good, particularly during the musical numbers.","

Wonka," Charming greatness
",UniqueParticle,29-Dec-23,"I very much enjoyed Wonka more than expected although musicals are my least favorite genre, the old ones had singing just not as much as this version; this is one of the best musicals I've seen! Timothee Chalamet is excellent worthy of golden globe nomination for his performance he's enjoyable in anything and the set design/costumes are worthy of nominee as well maybe the Oscar's will have more.Such a great story I'm surprised there's only been 3 films in the last 50 years probably hard to make at least they've been spectacular! The comedy is great one of the best aspects, plenty of charm and packed with excellent entertainment throughout.","

",rrtiverton,20-Dec-23,"When the previews for ""Wonka"" first arrived, I knew instantly that I needed to see it. ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" was a childhood favorite of mine. This movie did not disappoint!Paul King and Simon Farnby did an exceptional job crafting the genesis story of Willie Wonka with wonderful homage to the Gene Wilder orginal. Timothee Chalamet is superb as the young Willy, and he actually can sing and dance! Bringing me to the music! The numbers were great; superb lyrics and execution. Bonus: MR. CARSON (Jim Carter) SINGS!!! (Downton Abby). Loved the story, loved the characters. Calah Lane as ""Noodle"" is incredible! Great casting all the way around!And I have to admit that when Wonka sings ""Pure Imagination"", it brought a tear to my eye.Loved it. With all of my 62 year old heart, I loved it.","

",cmdown-50506,20-Dec-23,"If like me you've spent the last I don't know thirty plus years of your life watching Charlie and the chocolate factory during the Christmas period you'll really enjoy this.It's obviously really different from the original but it still manages to capture the vibe and keep you engaged throughout with little Easter eggs, songs and it's many hilarious moments.I'm a sucker for a good holiday movie and that's what this felt like, it outshines the Depp remake by miles and serves as a perfect addition to the wonka universe.I'd definitely recommend this one especially as a family movie. It might have just made its way onto my yearly Christmas watchlist.","

",grigoraaakis-889-295918,27-Dec-23,"A very imaginative origin story of the beloved character. There is something peculiar about ""Wonka"" in that it is an origin story but we really do not get to see much of him and his travels around the globe. There's still so much mystery left surrounding his character. Other than that, Timothée Chalamet is charming and absolutely fitting in the lead role. His charisma and charm are doing wonders for the movie. Many side characters and many of them not fully realised. Olivia Colman is having real fun playing the hideous villain of the story. Hugh Grant shines as the Oompa Loompa. This was pure fun, filled with joy and magic. ""Wonka"" brings nothing new to the character of Willy Wonka but still is a fun adventure!","

Even the music, on the way home from the theater noting really stuck with me, other than the throw back pieces from the original movie.There were elements of the original as well as the remake, but just not the memorable type from either.

Wonka," Entertaining, but not quite a masterpiece
",martingreen-71835,01-Feb-24,"Where to start with Wonka..?I grew up in the era of the original Willy Wonka movie, which has been watched and enjoyed countless times during my life. So to compare the new Wonka movie to the original would be a little unfair.I did have such high expectations for the new Wonka, and was desperate to watch the movie. The movie trailers had me hooked, the outstanding list of actors just added to the anticipation, as well as the buzz and reviews of the movie.In its own right the new Wonka movie is very good, the sets, the acting, the star studded cast, tick every box on how to create a blockbuster. But to me it didn't quite hit the mark, and I somehow felt it could have been better.But don't get me wrong, it is highly enjoyable to watch, and takes you on a very special journey where age doesn't matter, and the movie will be enjoyed by young and old.You have to watch to make up your own mind, but I feel many of the ten star reviews are maybe a little biased.?","

Wonka," HUGE SURPRISE
",filmtohster,09-Dec-23,"WONKA is a huge surprise and a fun time at the movies. I didn't really expect much going in, besides King's attachment as director, but was surprised at how well-made this film is. It blends movie magic, well choreographed musical numbers, and a heartwarming story to make the perfect family film. Although I would've preferred a bit more moral and meaning to the story, Wonka delivers a feel-good experience and I enjoyed it a lot. It is just what it needs to be and subverts expectations. When I first heard about Chalamet's casting as the title character, I thought it wouldn't work, coming off of Dune (2021), but I was wrong. His charisma and joyous presence on screen made me realize his capability as an actor. All of the cast members were really good, but the main star of the film is director Paul King. He previously directed Paddington 1 and 2, two films my family and I really enjoyed, and was my only source of optimism for this film. He really knocked it out of the park with the way he handled the story and reassured my faith in him as a filmmaker. The way he handled the musical elements of the film were especially well done. Overall, this is one of the better films I've seen this year and deserves more attention.","

Wonka," Pretty Magical
",baileycrawly,14-Jan-24,"Wonka is an interesting film. As far as origin stories go, they don't exactly set it up for something you would ever think would be successful. And then, with the likes of the handsome (and talented) Timothee Chalamet in the cast, it's easy to think of this movie as something hastily made simply because the ""Willy Wonka"" property is still viewed as profitable by the studio.And, while that may be true to an extent, this movie was overall pretty decently made. Timothee not only delivers his trademark second-to-none acting chops in front of the camera, but he also adds singing to his repertoire (something I, personally, have never seen him do in a role). He's got a gorgeous singing voice, which serves to make this even better.There are lots of little homages to Gene Wilder and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film as well and, although they often feel like yet another soulless act of fan service (isn't that everywhere these days?), it still holds up pretty well on its own.The music is fun and catchy, the characters are easily sympathizable and relatable, and the story flows well enough to keep me fully interested throughout the duration of the film. Where it starts to fall apart, however, is in the lore... particulalry surrounding the Oompa Loompas and how they came to work for Wonka.Look, I can fogive Hugh Grant in part for doing a relatively terrible job in the role (he was focused primarily on the payday of it all and, at this point, who can really blame him?), but what's a little bit harder to forgive is that, given that this film is billed as the origin of Willy Wonka, the inconsistencies of where, exactly, the Oompa Loompa characters came from and how Wonka ended up being tied to them is completely inaccurate and muddled to the story present in the book as well as both film versions (although more extensively in Tim Burton's rendition of the tale).Overall, if you can suspend your disbelief and forget (to a certain degree) about the finer details of the original story, this is a fun little piece of moviemaking magic that isn't afraid to have a good time. And you should, too, if you relax and enjoy it.I want to close by giving quick props to the satirical elements tackling the government, coroprations and their shady behaviours. Sure, it was played up for laughs but I can't help but feel the industry is taking a few (light-hearted?) jabs at themselves with the story behind this film.","

Sure it was predictable as some mentioned, but I felt the way this movie delivered was creative and imaginative. I know others around me were feeling it too because we laughed together and struggled to hold back tears towards the end. Worth the hype. Worth my time. Worth my money.

Wonka," Amazing family movie!
",Amsterdam-100-87908,17-Dec-23,"To start off that this movie for me has a different target audience than the 2005 or even the 1971 films. The vibe is much closer to the 1971 film, which I think was the intention of the creators. That was good for me as I am not a fan of the 2005 version at all. The film is basically a fairy tale. I watched with my two boys age 8 and we all loved it. The film is visually stunning! The colours, the brightness, the kind of history feel combined with the magi was just brilliant. I see in some reviews complaints about the acting. I guess everbody's taste but for me the acting was spot on. Timothee makes an amazing Wonka. He is witty, sparkling but also just boyish and hopeful. He sings well, dances well... I loved him in this movie. I see also complaints about the story but I wonder what people actually expected? The film is again meant to suit also younger audience and it did. It is not meant to be War and Peace :) All in all for me a great movie experience. I will certainly watch it again with the kids when it comes on the streaming services.","

Wonka," Wonka For the New Generation
",shelbythuylinh,15-Dec-23,"I agree with one reviewer over Timothee Chalamet portrayal of Willy Wonka. And that the late great Gene Wilder the original is the original.But this is a new version over in the late Ronald Dahl's book series. Timothee's Wonka is innocent but optimistic and how that he is poor but still doesn't stop him.He plans to spend a night over in a lodge like, only to be tricked into paying more and when he can't come up with it, forced to do laundry with others like him who can't pay against their will as the owners were bribing people.But when his new friends including an accountant and comedian to name a few. And an imprisoned orphan named Noodle who wants to find her real parents, want to figure out a way to make their way home and be release from their predicament.Wonka only can make chocolate but the antagonist in the movie a corrupt chocolate maker names Sluggsworth and his two minions want to put their plans in action who gets a corrupted police chief played by the hilarious Keegan Michael Kay to stop Wonka.The chief seems to be decent but is conflict. It is with a great ensemble cast with Rowan Atkinson as a corrupt priest.","

Wonka," «All the good things in this world started with a dream»
",anonim-73883,28-Dec-23,"Opinion on the movie «Wonka» (2023):I'll start with the fact that I found out about the film «Wonka» in 2021, then I was looking at the schedule of future premieres and saw this film in future premieres and began to expect it due to the fact that my favorite actor Timothée Chalamet starred in the lead role. Later, I found out that this movie was directed by Paul King (the Paddington duology) and I began to look forward to this film even more, and finally, after two years of waiting, «Wonka» was released in theaters. Today I managed to go to the cinema and watch this film, and what can I tell you? Did my expectations come true? Let's find out!«Wonka» - is a beautiful and lamp family film about the fact that dreams come true. The most important thing is not to give up, no matter how difficult they are.The plot is naïve and simple, but on the contrary, it benefits the film, it captures you from the very beginning and does not let go until the very end, the 116-minute chronometer passed in one breath, quickly and imperceptibly.The humor in the film is funny, and a couple of moments touch you to the core. The characters were not cardboard and wooden, each of them was revealed, and you can feel for some of the characters and empathize with them.The cast is gorgeous. Timothée Chalamet is an excellent Willy Wonka, knowing that Donald Glover, Ryan Gosling and Ezra Miller auditioned for the role of Wonka, Chalamet is generally the perfect choice for this role. Chalamet played well and did not overplay. The rest of the cast also did an excellent job.I really liked the soundtrack of the film, the songs are inserted not just for show, but each of them advances the plot. One of my favorites is the song «Pure Imagination» performed by Timothée Chalamet. I liked the rest of the songs as well.Also, I would like to note the excellent costumes, scenery, visuals and excellent camerawork.As a result, «Wonka» - is an excellent and tube-like family movie that is worth watching with the whole family in the cinema. I think in a couple of decades this film will become a classic of the 21st century.My rating is 10 out of 10 and I advise you to watch it!P. S: By the way, «Wonka» was the second movie I watched about believing in a dream this month, the first one was «The Inseparables», coincidence? I don't think so.","

This prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory had memorable music, fun dancing, great special effects, lovable characters and mean villains, and everything you could want in a clever story.

",surrinderella,10-Dec-23,"The book was a part of my childhood and I absolutely adored the film, watching whenever it was on TV... so it was very excited when I heard this was being made.I personally think Timothée Chalamet is a brilliant actor so my expectations were high and then my friend mentioned it was a musical and honestly my heart sank. The original works because it's old and of that time and as a child you feel differently about musicals. Now, I just find them a bit annoying and most have songs for songs sake. So as the first song started, I was more than ready to roll my eyes .... but it didn't happen. The songs were sweet, in-keeping with the story and they didn't feel over the top.Timothée absolutely shone as a yong Willy Wonka with his hat full of magic and hhis heart full of hopes and dreams. I felt his characterisation was perfect, confident but his belief in his craft spoke for itself... in the reaction from those tasting them. I honestly wanted to eat those Hoverchocs myself - A cherry and salted caramel marshmallow chocolate containing a microscopic hover-fly, the descriptions reminded me of the Roald Dahl book.I thought all the supporting actors were brilliant but I particularly loved Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa, a character I immediately connected to and it felt nostalgic to understand how Wonka first became acquainted with them.It's got everything you'd want from a feel good movie from a little injustice, the wonderfully awful villains, the hero and the help. I think this is going to be a huge success and a film I know I'll watch again and again.","

Wonka," The most heartwarming adventure I've seen in a long time.
",Shamus248,29-Dec-23,"In an age where the over-saturation of superhero flicks is leading to giant Marvel productions becoming box office bombs, and the public is yearning for quality pictures to hit the big screen, gliding in comes Wonka. The third feature length film based on Roald Dahl's 1964 book, this serves as an origin story for Willy Wonka, portrayed by Timothée Chalamet.This prequel adventure captures all of the charm and purity of the Gene Wilder-led 1971 classic. Though it discards almost all of the edge and darkness that occupied both that film and the 2005 follow-up, that's honestly one of this film's strengths. This film is brimming with boundless amounts of heart, soul, warmth and humanity. Chalamet is nothing short of stellar as Wonka. He oozes empathy for those around him and dedication to his chocolatiering craft.The music and choreography are masterful. Every number has so much heart. The editing and special effects bring the in-universe setting to life in a way that is as majestic and dreamlike as the source material suggests. Calah Lane also shines as the adorable Noodle and Hugh Grant as the iconic Oompa Loompa.Just when I thought they didn't make movies like this anymore, this one left me with such a big smile on my face.

Wonka," A simply delightful and magical film to bring you cheer!
",meydiana-65242,29-Jan-24,"Wonka is the spiritual prequel to the 1971 masterpiece and family-classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This film is hyper focused on the backstory behind the wacky, eager and joyous chocolatier as he returns from a seven-year excursion and attempts to make his way in the world as the most renowned chocolate maker. Throughout the film, Wonka is faced with the success and failure of a candy-maker, while meeting a group of captive workers in a launderette, most notably a young girl named Noodle, who follow him on his journey to attaining his dream and facing the Chocolate Cartel trio consisting of Slugworth, two other well-known chocolate makers, as well as the police force. It is, in essence, the companion to the 1971 film and illuminates the humble beginnings of the titular character in a way we never thought we would see. Timothée Chalamet's performance as Willy Wonka is brilliant. Timothée, throughout the film, is able to capture that aurora we all felt watching Gene Wilder play the quirky and fun candy maker. His mannerisms, temperament, humor, wittiness, and enthusiasm is unmatched, cementing himself as the Willy Wonka we know and love in Gene Wilder. As first, many seemed skeptical of how well he would perform, but undoubtedly, Timothée Chalament is simply wonderful. Another charming performance is that of Calah Lane as Noodle, the orphan worker Wonka meets in the film. Her companionship matched with Chalamet's well-natured character, displays such emotion and hope. Lane's character is confused and silenced initially, but through Wonka, she finds herself and then builds the confidence to become wholesome while tagging along with him. The last performance that was quite impressive and exciting was Hugh Grant as Lofty, a cunning, ill-humored, and persistently annoying Oompa Loompa bent on making Wonka pay for his crime of stealing from Loompaland. Hugh Grant is hysterical, even though his appearance in the film is short of just half an hour in segmentation. Though his screen time was limited, Hugh Grant's performance as an Oompa Loompa is both comical and entertaining. He really does capture the disposition of the Oompa Loompa's from the 1971 film and even sings in the original riddle-like voice and rhythm from the 1971 film too! The additional and supporting cast are exceptional as well. Keegan-Michael Key, Rowan Atkinson, and company just add that much more laughs and interest to the film. The music accompanying the film is beautiful. Just like the original film, the score and compositions add such wonder to this story and even contain subtle clues of songs you may have heard in the Mel Stuart film! Such light-heartedness and beauty give the music such importance and depth, truly encapsulating the movement and tone of the film. The CGI, practical effects, scenery, and more were outstanding as well. Everything was on the dot and seemed real to the point that it will leave you feeling that making chocolate that can make you fly or coming across little orange men with green hair can actually exist! Overall, Wonka is the perfect film, not only because of its simplicity, but how it is representative of establishing the backstory of both literature and cinema's most iconic character. Though Gene Wilder is sadly no longer with us, he would be proud of Timothée's performance and the charm presented by every bit of time and effort put into the making of this film. A must see film is you love Willy Wonka or if you generally love this type of film!","

Wonka," Great family heartwarming fun
",a-clinch1,08-Dec-23,"Don't we need so many more of these types of films? Heartwarming feelgood wholesome fun. Friendship and dreams. Great songs. Remaining positive even in challenging times. One hour and fifty six minutes floats by gently and yet swiftly. Not a bad note throughout the film. Kids under ten will love it. Even my thirteen year old son gave it nine out of ten. The director also made the Paddington films and whilst it was not as good as them, it was still a great way to spend two hours. All of the actors were exceptional and you could almost tell that they had as much fun making it as we did watching it. Take your children to see it. You and your family will not be disappointed.","

Wonka," Timothee is a great Wonka, but...
",annapavlik,29-Dec-23,"But the music just wasn't it. Also i felt like the storyline lacked something and was to cringy at times ( the giraffe thing in church). I can still admit it was enjoyable movie, but i liked previous Wonkas better. Overall it's fine but just not great. I was so hyped for the movie but i was expecting something more from it, and definetly i wanted at least one catchy song 😭 Also it's funny how many people didn't know it's a musical, so be awarie. I would say probably kids will enjoy it, but if you watched previous Wonkas movies you may end up disappointed. Also i wanted to eat chocolate at the end of a movie do be prepared for that as well.","

Wonka," Hats off to the latest chocolate factory film!
",cricket30,20-Dec-23,"As Queen Victoria often said regarding Sherlock Holmes, ""The hat makes the man."" I think that Willy's topper from his latest cinematic outing is his best head covering of all three films. The milliner for this movie did a great job in matching head-wear to character to actor. This picture deserves at least a nomination in the ""Best Costume"" category on the basis of Willy's derby alone. Though some viewers may quibble that when the Chocolate Cartel blows up the ship onto which they've lured their rival toward the close of this story his hat should have disappeared as he swam miles to shore, this criticism overlooks the fact that Willy is a magician, so his hat obviously is magical, too. The film crew even included a Magic Consultant. In summary, this prequel gets a big boost from its attention to detail, particularly when it comes to hats.","

Wonka," Best Kind of Prize is a SURprize Hahaha
",dorMancyx,25-Dec-23,"Insipid, no gravity, made-for-child-less-than-10. Very cliche and predictable plot that is lacking in pacing and too magical to be believable. The girl who played Noodle has no acting skill whatsoever. None of the songs sticked. There are a few chuckle-worthy moments with Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Colman, but that's more because of performer charisma. Sally Hawkins is also laudable just for her perfect mom image. I do appreciate Timothee Chalamet for attempting to imitate Johnny Depp's version of Wonka in terms of the mannerism, expression, and cadence. Overall, a pretty bland film.","

",vengeance20,08-Dec-23,"I was skeptical going into this one & of course when I first heard about it, but nonetheless, went into seeing it as I have seen the 1971 Original & 2005 Remake of the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory Films.With dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor Willy Wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.I found the film to be quite good! It's got a good story, good characters & plenty of visuals & dazzling ace effects. Even for a musical, it's ace & really well made! The films a little long at 1 hour & 50 minutes & does drag a tad bit, but it's good with some not bad songs that are well shot when the actors dance & break into song!Overall, it's a pretty good film!

Wonka," A Magical Improvement for Willy Wonka!
",KFstudios2009,12-Dec-23,"Wonka's story in this film is very weakly based on the book, but they made something new, something we can call a prequel, but not exactly. It's a story on its own. The story that tells us the beginnings of Willy Wonka, and how he and his chocolate became famous. First of all, I was a little skeptical about this. I thought that the new actor for Willy would be dumb and badly played, but I got the exact opposite of it. Wonka performed by Timothée Chalamet played absolutely amazing, he did have this magic that somehow Johnny Depp didn't have. He was the actor that fitted the character surprisingly best, from what I have seen so far. Timothée did sing very good, too, and he sang the songs greatly with a nice voice, as well as the rest of the cast. The story was gripping and extremely well developed. Wonka's flashbacks with his mother (Not father this time) was a well addition to the story and his character development came brighter in, and he was more understandable then, too. Wonka as a character was good introduced, but I think his backstory came much later, and could come more on the beginning, but that's ok. Wonka's friend, Noodle, was a good addition to the story, and she as his friend was something amazing. Wonka's connection with Noodle was organic and didn't felt fake at all. The action and build-up was in a way that I could see it was a Paul King film. He directed the two Paddington movies, and he has a similar style of humor and way of building up action. The moral was good, good value and something everyone can get out from the story. But the scenography was the absolutely best thing about the film. The strong, powerful colors from the candy and chocolate, and the amazing decorations and exteriors in the town they lived in. Nice visuals, as well as the costumes for the actors and actress. Hugh Grant as the Umpa-Lumpa had a fantastic costume, and he was characterized great with good make-up and had the perfect size for the creature. The songs were composed fine, sometimes could the text have a better rhythm to the melody, but that was rare, maybe two or three times it happened. In the end, Wonka was a great experience, a perfect film for the whole family, I really liked the first film, but this one is just more magical and made in a different way, that I really enjoyed. Recommending!","

Full disclosure, I'm not a fan of watching musicals on the screen. If I want to see a musical, I'll go to Broadway. They really need to make it clear in the trailers that this is not a movie but a musical. Did I mention I'm not a fan of musicals? If you like musicals you'll probably like this.","

Wonka," Beyond disappointing
",corinnedeberry,29-Dec-23,"Speaking as a massive fan of Paddington 1 and 2, Horrible Histories (OG) and Peep Show, when I saw the cast I was about as excited as it's possible to be about a film. But there was so much wrong with it. The plot (too predictable, too boring), the dialogue (unmemorable), the songs (terrible idea!), the pace (too hectic)... I won't go on.My kids (15 and 12) were so bored. My biggest complaint is that they wasted the talents of a dozen superb comedic actors. Why did they choose to focus on this bit of the Wonka story? Why not start at the beginning and explore what made him a genius/magician with a slightly twisted view of the world? Why give him a (predictable) dead mother as motivation? Why not give Hugh Grant's character a bigger role?Simon Farnaby and Paul King were incredible on Paddington, so I can only assume they were forced to make a lot of compromises, or write this in a hurry. I genuinely don't know who this was written for but I hope there isn't a sequel! The only positive is that visually it looks great.","

Imagine my surprise when I realized it was a Wonka origin story.The story, while not terribly complex, was rich enough to keep attention as was the cinematography. The pacing was solid and 2 hours never felt laborious or drawn out.Where this movie shines was the acting/casting. Tomothèe Chalamet was absolutely perfect in this role as was the rest of the cast. The characters were colorful, endearing, and wildly entertaining. The music was fun, touching, and a few songs had me laughing out loud.I went into this movie to spend time with family.

",miguelungson,04-Feb-24,"First, it was deceptive because it was never marketed as a musical and it is. I have no problems with musicals but it's wrong to not say so.It has an okay story, but as a fan of Roald Dahl, they never should have adapted Willy Wonka if they will completely change his character. An adaptation means a different take on the same characters and the same story. If you change Willy Wonka's backstory, then he is not Willy Wonka anymore. Without the depth of his backstory and the borderline crazy and genius, this character is definitely not Willy Wonka!!!The acting and the songs are okay, but it could actually be a different story just inspired by Willy Wonka and it would be better.","

Wonka," A sweet and whimsical adventure!
",steveinadelaide,18-Dec-23,"I love chocolate! And it would seem that the consumption of nearly 7.5 million metric tonnes of it around the world last year indicates there's a lot of people out there who do too! And who among us hasn't enjoyed the past movies about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory? But how did Willy Wonka get to be such a famous character? Director Paul King has the answer in the new Wonka movie.The performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are all better than they needed to be to make this movie sure to be a hit. Timothé Chalamet, who portrays Willy Wonka, gives the character a youthful charm and eccentric edge that feels new and nuanced.The world of Wonka is whimsical and filled with vibrant colours, and the candy creations are delightfully yummy! The original songs are catchy and heartwarming. The well-composed songs are seamlessly integrated into the story and add a beautiful touch of magic and emotional depth. Despite my usual distaste for musicals, I found myself tapping my foot along on multiple occasions. Wonka celebrates the power of our imaginations and encourages us to embrace our own unique dreams.Considering how entertaining Wonka was for the most part, I feel bad about having to criticise it. I'll have to indulge in the guilty pleasure of chocolate consumption to compensate 😉. Just three things I'll mention:Firstly, the story feels a bit rushed sometimes, particularly in the second half of the movie, which leaves some of the character arcs underdeveloped. Second, if you are familiar with Roald Dahl's world or have watched the original film, you might recognise some of the story's fundamental plot points. And, finally, while Wonka shines, some of the supporting characters, like the young Oompa-Loompas, could have had their personalities fleshed out.Leaving those few flaws behind, it is important to mention that Wonka tackles some serious issues! It reminds us that 'the greedy beat the needy every time.' It touches on the themes of resilience and resourcefulness-traits we definitely need to develop nowadays. And most importantly, does candy have a point?Wonka is beautiful and moving, and it shows how important it is to be creative and follow one's dreams. And it justifies the necessity of chocolate! Despite its flaws (a predictable plot and underdeveloped supporting characters), Wonka is a fun film with a fantastic performance from Timothée Charlamet and is sure to be a hit with families with children older than eight. Lots of grownups, though, will be curious to see it as well!","

",thekarmicnomad,29-Jan-24,"This has a lot of things going for it - great cast, good performances, production and clearly some love was invested in making this.The result is a fine movie - but nothing fantastic.I think this is a children's film as oppose to a family movie.There is not much of a plot: stuff just happens and when a problem seems too difficult to tackle Willy literally pulls the solution out of his hat.This leads to a lot of silliness that kids will probably appreciate.The songs are ok but I have forgotten them already.The sets are interesting but the CGI feels oppressive.There is some great acting (especially Coleman) but most of the charters are pretty shallow.Whereas the original was about shunning greed, gluttony and selfishness - this seems to be about solving everything with magic and chocolate.Got a problem? Eat this sweet and it will make you big or small or strong or whatever you need.Got no money or any place to sleep? Eat a chocolate.I think too much was put on Calah Lane's shoulders - she gives a sterling effort but it is such a big part to put on such a young actor - and in a lot of places it shows.","

Wonka," Alarmingly poor take - show the kids the otherntwo
",TheMovieBBQ,21-Jan-24,"This is a trivial watered down dart board scripting. Essentially take a great work and arranging it in theost diluted way inorder to pretend to be unique. Extremely predictable dialogue and interjected with the most vanilla.lazy AI generated CGI and computer voice enhcnaed Ssng-along.kareoke at best.Was expecting a fantastic musical with an original take, but this is clearly some delusional direction with incoherent fantasy CGI travesty.The delivery of this particular story completely assassinate, ignore ls and disassembles the works of Roald Dahl.l to make a bick off the name.The only saving grace is the most excellent Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson and of Keegan-Michael Key the rest dial the roles in like some year 1 acting class due to the poor story and lack of leadership in the script for strong colourful characters. The portrayal of the main characters are diminished by the deeply superficial stereotypes rooted in culture rather than actual story.If you think this is harsh, try hearing the 11 and 12 year olds only laugh when Grant, Atkinson and MK deliver lines with flawless timing and vocal tincture due to some serious experience with rubbish scripts. The rest of cast did the best they could while delivering lines to green coated objects or green onesies - which leads to the next point...Visual effects, often are poorly executed and lazy with perspectives that bends fantasy into complete nonsensical visual oddity. Sometimes set building is worth it, just to deliver a believable charm to classic fantasy. The CGI is often visually askew and breaks immersion often. May as well has the set staff hanging about in any given scene and no one would bat an eyelidThe misical score is well executed and the throwback re arrangements are excellent but feels like the musics direction got told hard what to make. It was missings the individual input that is required to give it a X factor that takes a movie lift from the trivial into a classic.Full credit to cast and musicians whom must of been frustrated on set at the atrocious job of the editong so 4th wall breaking may as well if has the crew in shot.Writing - Sorry Bucket family, you.Do not exist - we will just do some random stuff and create more random stuff completely unrelated - I guess the sequel will be called Elevator and be about a magical egg beater. Did the writers get told what to do? Likely.""Come and see, you will see, a world of pure abomination""","

",Snootz,27-Jan-24,"With a current 7.6 approval rating it's evident the general audience liked this film. I usually very much enjoy family films. But I have to admit I found this a bit underwhelming.The only actor I really liked was Calah Lane, who played Noodle. The other actors just weren't given much script to work with.The songs were disappointing and the choreography worse. Add to that the general dismal and depressing sets, and there's very little in this that felt like Willie Wonka.The villains were cliche, the authorities corrupt, and the ""wonder"" of Wonka really wasn't that wondrous. What was seriously lacking was the sense of mystery that was in the original film, the eerie feeling that Wonka was just a little... odd.The main actor (Wonka) didn't really impress me in performance, singing or dancing. Of course that could be because the songs and choreography were sub-standard to begin with.In the end the film just barely held my attention, which really surprised me. I was expecting to sit down and fully enjoy this, but simply didn't. It was a disappointing presentation of a beloved character and simply didn't live up to expectations.I'm glad people generally enjoyed it. But I feel this could have been a whole lot better, especially with today's movie making tools and by today's standards. This felt like a cheaply-made film from the 90s, and that definitely wasn't what was expected.","

Wonka," A magically charming film.
",ethanbresnett,08-Dec-23,"Wonka joins a long line of IP that is being squeezed by the film industry as they try to eek out every last penny from recognisable names and brands. But does that mean that this film is just a lazy cash grab? Thankfully no.There is a magically charming quality to this film that warms the heart and puts a smile on the face. It is full of whimsy humour, over exaggerated characters and delightfully lyrical dialogue that all create a fun and engaging world to dive into. You can tell that care has been put into this film.It has a nice and breezy plot with some good character moments and decent momentum, even if it is a little overly sweet at times. I do also think it plays much more to its younger audience than its older one, and could have pushed some of the jokes and dialogue a little more to redress this balance. Overall the story is not particularly showstopping but it does the job.The cast is a veritable who's who of British comedy actors with some great bigger name cameos in there too. I do think the performances are a mixed bag but there are some great ones in here. Then there's the performance from Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, which I wasn't always convinced by. At times I loved it, but at others it feels a little cheesy (and not in the intentionally cheesy way that some of the other performances are).As a musical I was never truly convinced by any of the songs or any of the vocals. I'm writing this review shortly after watching the film and there are no melodies bouncing around my head that I can't shake. Usually after watching a musical I find at least one song to add to my playlist, but that isn't the case here.Ultimately I did like this film and it is a good time, but I think the brilliant tone and vibe cover up some of it's mediocrity. It has a good plot and a good lead performance, but there isn't much about this film that is amazing.","

",Jithindurden,08-Dec-23,"I've always liked Timothee Chalamet's performances. Even when he did things exceptionally, it felt like he was really good at that but still not enough for me to love him as an actor. There's a certain charm that I find in actors I grow to love and I found that in him here. Chalamet is brilliant as well as the rest of the cast. I didn't know Olivia Coleman was in this, and even though I recognized her face, I couldn't place her. She looks much younger here as the evil Mrs. Scrubbit and have a completely different body language that I couldn't place her till the credits came on screen, brilliant. Paul King has made this as sweet and optimistic as the Paddington films, even though it does have the darkness of the Wonka world. The movie doesn't dwell on those dark moments, it quickly follows them up with optimism. The songs were great and the older songs used were such fantastic placements. Willy Wonka is yet to be truly betrayed by people and he has the innocence and purity here and that works perfectly. Whatever problems I had must be things that aren't even part of what they meant to tell through this movie. This worked fantastically as a prequel to the 1971 movie.","

Wonka," The Definition of Charming
",cdjh-81125,08-Dec-23,"I hardly ever used this word to describe movies but Wonka is absolutely delightful in almost every way. Honestly if someone watched it and told me they weren't at least charmed by it I might question their sanity. Sometimes it's just nice to have a film about good people doing good things with a really wholesome message and outlook on life and Wonka delivers all of that and then some.Timothée Chalamet is amazing in this movie, very few actors could emulate that overly whimsy style of humour that Gene Wilder perfected and he does it so perfectly. The way he plays this character is so unbelievably endearing with just the right amount of sentimentality and it never made me cringe once, quite the opposite in fact. He's just the head of a whole cast full of unbelievably likeable characters that ensure that this entire film is chock full of satisfying moments some of which even brought a tear to my eye as cheesy as it might sound.It really should come as no surprise how well produced this film is on a technical and script level considering the fact that it's the same man who brought about both the Paddington films. It's gorgeously shot, especially from a cinematography perspective, and I loved all of the musical sequences all of which I'm still playing in my head right now. It's laugh out loud funny with a lot more well rounded character moments than I ever would've expected. This clearly was not a pay check job for anyone involved and this is the kind of craft I would love to see more of in blockbuster movies.If I had to knock the film for a few things it would be that a lot of the stuff away from the Wonka character wasn't nearly as entertaining. All the villainous characters were over-the-top in all the right ways but they did start to wear out their welcome for me after a while. Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa is such a great concept and he is fantastic but he wasn't in the movie as much as I would've liked because he and Chalamet made such a great pair. I also think the film was starting to feel a little long by the time the 3rd act came around but I was having such a good time watching it that it didn't bother me too much.Wonka was far better than it had any right to be and I could absolutely see myself rewatching many more times. Chalamet is basically perfect and this role just goes to show how much range he has as an actor. I would fight back against anyone who thinks this is a corporate cash grab because the feeling it gave me is one very few other movies have given me all year. I think the best compliment I could give Wonka is that it's absolutely a movie I would show my kids one day.","

",tqbkjbwvpd,11-Dec-23,"I had little idea what to expect, but the kids wanted to see it...There were wonderful moments in the Gene Wilder film and some great songs, it departed badly from the Dahl story and I found Wonka too harsh. Depp's was too tied up in the simile with Michael Jackson that it was just creepy and unpleasant, and I say that as a huge fan.We go back decades in the Wonka world to this film and we find a young man who is softer and kinder. This all makes sense.The casting is insanely brilliant, the pacing spot on, the script bonkers and wonderful with so many deft touches. The sets beautiful, the CGI well-managed and the music is simply amazing. We're still humming them all today and will be for years to come. Bravo Hannon and Talbot.Do a few of the actors need their singing a little digitally-corrected? Yes. But in a world of Wonka gloss and magic, I think that's a tiny criticism given what a wonderful, magical world it creates and how it fleshes out the Wonka story in such a respectful fashion that I think Dahl would be delighted with.And, wow, Calah Lane... watch her go places.","

Wonka," Make Heyday while the sun shines
",njijaaj,20-Dec-23,"There's a warm glow to this film. A comfort of joy washes over you as you settle down for this visual treat. It is a borderline musical and it does not take long to establish that musical numbers will come your way.. a lot. They are catchy for sure, but they are unlikely to win any awards. I really did like Timothée Chalamet in this. I thought it was a great casting choice. I'm sure there was a lot of thought went into choosing him and it paid off. I actually preferred his of all the WONKAs gone before. Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp were bordering psychotic weirdos, although I'm probably alone in that thought. Chalamet takes an easier friendlier approach and makes for his friendships in the film much more believable. I don't think the film would have worked otherwise. You know it's a HEYDAY movie now when there is an olde worlde funfair chucked in (and a giraffe) and the cast from past heyday movies (especially from Paddington) make a return for this predominantly British cast. Tom Davis was the chef T-Bone and plays Bleacher in this. I actually laughed out very loudly in the cinema when he puts his lederhosen on! Overall I loved this movie. My hard to please son who is 10, gave it an 8.9 so I'd trust that more than what I'm writing. Overall, lots of fun with a good ending.","

It will take you to a world of pure imagination and keep you there the entire time.It will end up being a classic and one not to miss. I couldn't name one thing I didn't like so this was a 10 for me.Think 'The Greatest Showman' meets 'Willy Wonka'.It's been a long time since I've left the movie theatre feeling the way Wonka made me feel.Being 35 means I had a childhood watching classics, one of them being Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I must prepare you. The end of this new 'Wonka' will take you right back to those same feelings you got watching the original for the first time. Prepare yourself to well up.Those first musical notes of 'Pure imagination' is transformative.Wonderful. Just wonderful.","

Wonka," I get it but not my taste
",SnoopyStyle,24-Jan-24,"Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives in a big European city with little more than a dream to open a magical chocolate shop. He signs a bad contract with Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman) and is forced to do laundry. He befriends little orphan Noodle who is similarly trapped. He struggles to sell his chocolates against a trio of establishment chocolatiers who have a stranglehold on the corrupt police.Sure, the 1971 movie has plenty of songs and a couple of them are iconic. I was not expecting a musical, but I wasn't surprised either. It is telling that the best songs here are redoing the old icons. I don't remember any of the other songs. This is adapting Willy Wonka to Broadway musical Annie. Chalamet is not quite Gene Wilder. Who is? There is a missed opportunity here. The movie actually gave me a great idea early on. Wonka is imagining his chocolate shop with pedestrians dancing away. In reality, it's all in his head. This world should be a Dickensian hell scape, but he sees the magical world underneath. That's what I want for this movie. As it stands, this is not going to be remembered like the iconic original.","

Wonka," Dr. Suess' Talent-less Twin
",Chris-74934,30-Dec-23,"Wow...and I don't mean that in a good way. First off, I am not a big fan of musical movie adaptations, however, I respect that many people do. I also appreciate that this art form requires a lot of talent, and I tend to take this into account when reviewing movies (in other words, I put my bias aside and evaluate how much effort was put into the movie, whether I really liked it or not). Having said that, this film was a dud. Every new song from this movie lacked cohesion and did not rhyme (unless real words were butchered to make it fit). It almost seemed as if somebody put together the complete soundtrack during the length of a 5-minute shower. Perhaps, ""Dr. Suess' Talent-less Twin"" put together this atrocity. That could be the only explanation. You will really appreciate the original films ability to seamlessly mix the word ""trepidation"" into a song, after sitting through this two-hour nightmare.Now, let's move on to the worst aspects of this movie: the plot and acting. The main actor playing Wonka (Timothy Chalet) lacks the basic screen presence needed for a supporting actor, much less a lead in a major motion picture. His embarrassingly small range of emotion was, at best, laughable. Other supporting actors were overbaked, resembling mere caricatures on many occasions. The plot was simply idiotic and bland, and could not be saved by the presence of Hugh Grant. I really cannot see why this movie received such high praise. I had very low expectations and would have given this a much higher review, had it just been average. I rarely give reviews below a 3 or 4 out of 10, but this movie is a worthy exception. Do not waste your money if you are on the fence. In fact, see ""The Holdovers"" instead, this holiday season.","

",Prismark10,26-Jan-24,"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory from 1971 was regarded as a mixed bag for many years. A strange confection that never hit the sweet spot. Now it is regarded as a classic.Paul King and Simon Farnaby the makers of the Paddington movies have reimagined a prequel Wonka. Before Wonka started the Chocolate factory.Timothee Chalamet plays Willy Wonka. He arrives in town to open his confectionary shop and introduce the world to his magical confection.Only the illiterate Wonka finds himself press-ganged as a slave in a boarding house. He could not read the terms and conditions.The cartel of chocolatiers fix it with the authorities that Wonka fails.Wonka was a big box office hit. So unlike the 1971 film, it will not have to wait to be rediscovered.I thought this was full of interminable songs and had lazy charm. The only bright spark was Hugh Grant with the Oompa Loompa song from the original movie.A lot of the plot from the naive innocent Wonka to the vile landlord Mrs Scrubitt were recycled from other movies like Les Miserables.","

He was great as Wonka!Hugh Grant was great as an Oompa Loompa, it was very funny seeing him as a small orange man with green hair.I loved the new characters like Noodle, Mrs. Scrubitt, Bleacher, the 3 chocolate cartels and there were so many more and they were all great!This version of Wonka has nothing to do with the previous movies ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" it is completely different, it is about how Willy Wonka became the famous chocolatier we know now.There were many musical numbers including new versions of ""Pure Imagination"" and ""Oompa Loompa"" it was very nostalgic and nice to hear again. The Original Score is amazing, and I haven't stoped listening to it since it came out, it's just something else, it's magic! To be honest I cried when Timothée started singing ""Pure Imagination"".There is a scene where Wonka and Noodle are running away from the zoo and singing as well as dancing and that specific scene melted my heart, it was so sweet and nice.Timothee brought a new version of Wonka to the world, there are references to the Gene Wilder Wonka and when you notice them there is a little spark in you which makes you smile! The movie is filled with love, happiness and hope as well as adventure.I really recommend going and watching this movie in the theatre with your family, friends and loved ones in general, it brings a bit of hope to you and it was just so magical.The cast was amazing and they all did an amazing job!""Everything in the world started with a dream"" 🍫🎩","

Wonka," Boring - suitable only for smaller children I'd say
",pufflingpants,04-Feb-24,"This movie tries very hard and does fail in nearly everything. There is no heart, everything that should be magical seems wooden, the camerawork, the directing is so boring. There is no depth in the acting of Chalamet, there is no sense of danger or hardship palpable when noodle is put into the coop or when we see the people in the laundry in the basement. So there can be no relieve or urgency felt when they are rescued. It's not the fault of the actors, the cast is good. And well, I hate the musical stuff (I always do ;-)), but that's just a matter of taste and doesn't affect my rating. I guess small children could have fun with this.","

Wonka," If Only I Had Watched This as a Kid
",guishanghai,29-Jan-24,"If I had watched this as a kid, I just know it would have instantly become one of my favorites. Unfortunately, as an adult, it ends up being quite difficult not to be critical of some aspects of this film.To get the positives out of the way, the entire production and costume design are outstanding, and when the story takes its time to explore Wonka and his quirky inventions, the creativity is, without a doubt, a standout (wish there was more of it!). A highlight is the shop scene with the yeti tears.Other than that, the story just didn't quite manage to engage me. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but overall, I didn't feel drawn in. The characters all seemed quite cartoonish and over-the-top in their mannerisms and dialogue, which struck me as odd since the original (to which this one is a spiritual prequel) is grounded in realism despite its fantastical elements. The Chocolate Cartel, Bleacher, and the Chief of Police are all examples of this-uninspired and one-dimensional.I don't want to be overly critical, knowing I'm probably not the target audience, but the songs were also forgettable, both lyrically and melodically. Finally, I wish the film hadn't relied on visual effects as much, as it ended up contributing even more to the lack of realism and made it harder for me to feel immersed. It all felt too fake.I guess that all pretty much summarizes my thoughts. I did have a few laughs and was marveled at times by the creativity put on screen, but at the same time couldn't connect as much as I had liked to the story and its characters.I still do recommend it though, worth a watch nonetheless.","

Wonka," It's fine. Not bad fine. Good fine. But fine.
",tvpvdbh,28-Dec-23,"Wonka was fine. I mean, it was good. I expected to be annoyed, and I wasn't in the slightest. It's well written, well directed, very good acting all around, uniformly by everyone. The songs are clever. Very appealing characters and a solidly written story. Timothée Chalamet is super charming as Willy Wonka, breezy and fun. I enjoyed Calah Lane as Noodle. She really grounds the whole movie with a believable combination of weary cynicism, unexpected wonder and hope. Olivia Coleman is a great villain, had a lot of fun. Keegan Michael Key, Matt Lucas, I mean, the entire cast is solid.Part of the problem is that, despite the seeming high stakes of the story, not very much seemed at stake. Willy Wonka is so breezy and so easily inventive, there's never any doubt that he's going to be ok. In fact, because it's a prequel, it's guaranteed he's going to be ok because he's destined to build that chocolate factory, after all. In the original, it was Charlie who had everything at stake, and you felt it. In this one, it should have been Noodle. But as she is the secondary character, her story can't be the central, driving one, even though hers is the story, as written, with the most at stake. In the context of this movie, however, her story is too tied to his for it to ever feel like the outcome of her story was in doubt.I left feeling, well, that was nice. Lots of good stuff. Solid. But Willy Wonka should be magic. And for whatever reason, the magic and wonder or giddy fun didn't happen for me. I liked it WAY better than Tim Burton's version, which I hated. But this chocolately treat, while well made and tastey, failed to lift me off my feet.","

A young Wonka is thwarted by over-the-top enemies who are outrageously cruel.There were too many songs and too many attempts at heartfelt 'Disney' moments that would surely have made Dahl cringe.There was a totally unnecessary subplot involving corrupt priests that could only be seen as a vulgar attack on the Catholic Church.Chalamet was very good in the title role and Olivia Coleman delivered the sought of broad comedy she was known for before her surprising Oscar triumph in The Favourite. Hugh Grant, and his clipped English accent, made the Oompa Loompa character amusingly memorable.There was too much focus on the Noodle character. Oodles of Noodle was too much.Just watch the 1971 version. It's the best.","

",jboothmillard,16-Dec-23,"The original 1971 Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder is a scrumdiddlyumptious classic, while the remake by Tim Burton with Johnny Depp has its tasty moments, I heard about this prequel to the Roald Dahl story almost a year before its release, I was looking forward to it, produced by David Heyman (Harry Potter), co-written and directed by Paul King (Paddington). Basically, aspiring magician, inventor and chocolate maker Willy Wonka (Golden Globe nominated Timothée Chalamet) arrives in the big city to seek his fortune and open a chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He quickly burns through his small savings and finds a laundry/boarding house to stay the night. But the owner Mrs. Scrubitt (Olvia Colman) is a devious woman, along with her henchman Bleacher (Tom Davis). Orphan girl Noodle (introducing Calah Lane), who stays at Scrubitt's, warns Willy to read the small print, but he is illiterate and signs the contract regardless. Wonka is confident that he can draw in customers for his chocolate at the Galeries Gourmet and sells his ""hoverchocs"" which make those who eat them fly. The three main chocolatiers of the galleria, Mr. Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Mr. Fickelgruber (The Wrong Mans' Mathew Baynton), mock Wonka's chocolates but are secretly impressed by their taste and his ingenuity and see him as a threat to their business. They call the Chief of Police (Keegan-Michael Key) who confiscates his earnings. Unable to pay Scrubitt, Willy is consequently forced to work down in the launderette for up to 10,000 days (27 years) to pay his debt. The other workers trapped in Scrubitt's basement are accountant Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), plumber Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), telephone operator Lottie Bell (EastEnders' Rakhee Thakrar), comedian Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Abacus tells Willy that Slugworth, Prodnose, and Fickelgruber are the ""Chocolate Cartel"" and are in cahoots to eliminate any competition. The Cartel's base of operations is located beneath a cathedral, run by the corrupt Father Julius (Rowan Atkinson) and his ""chocoholic"" monks, where they store a large container of chocolate. Wanting to get out and satisfy the public with his chocolates, Willy plans to distract Scrubitt and Bleacher, manipulating them into falling in love with each other, so that he can sneak out, with the help of Noodle. On his first trip out, Willy is successful in making sales, but the Chocolate Cartel exploits the Chief's love of chocolates to threaten Wonka into leaving town. Willy ignores the warning and continues to sell chocolate, becoming a sensation with the public. Noodle teaches him how to read, and he avoids the police using magic tricks, and sewage drains as escape routes. After introducing Noodle to her first piece of chocolate, Willy explains that his love for chocolate came from his mother (Sally Hawkins), who made him one last chocolate bar before she passed away. Willy has told Noodle that various times he has made chocolate, his jars have been stolen by a mysterious ""orange man"", who has been stalking him for years, but she does not believe him. One night, Willy and Noodle travel to the local zoo to milk a giraffe to create his signature chocolate using Giraffe milk. The two of them recruit Abacus, Piper, Larry, and Lottie to help him sell chocolates to pay their debts while evading Scrubitt and the Chief. Meanwhile, Willy catches the ""orange man"" who has been stealing his chocolates, an Oompa-Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Years ago, Willy took precious cocoa beans from Loompa Land, which Lofty was watching, and he wants Willy to pay him back in chocolate. Willy's group earns enough money to open his dream chocolate store in the galleria to an excited crowd. However, the Chief and the Chocolate Cartel have got wind of this, and they tell Scrubitt about what they have been up to. The Cartel spoils his chocolates, putting yeti sweat into them, causing customers to grow excessive hair and discolour their skin. The angry crowd demand their money back, ransack the place, and cause Wonka's store to burn down. Returning to the launderette, the Cartel confess their sabotage of his business and make Willy an offer. They will pay off all the debts of his friends, and give Noodle a future if he leaves town and stops making chocolate forever. Willy reluctantly accepts the offer and boards a boat that night. Lofty joins Willy aboard the boat and motivates him to return and fight back against the Cartel before they abandon ship after finding a bomb set to explode. With their debts paid, Abacus, Piper, Larry, and Lottie are released from the launderette, but Slugworth pays Scrubitt to refrain from releasing Noodle. Willy returns and his group rescue Noodle; Willy discovered she is the daughter of Slugworth's dead brother. Noodle's mother left her with Slugworth, but he realised she could claim the family fortune when she grows up. Slugworth dumped his niece with Scrubitt and lied to her mother that she had died. Willy and his friends put together a plan to expose the Cartel using an accounts book Abacus had spotted when he worked for Slugworth. Releasing the giraffe into the cathedral as a distraction, Willy and Noodle go beneath ground to find the book but are cornered by the Cartel. They are trapped in the container where they are to be drowned in chocolate. Before entering, Willy asks the Cartel to give a jar of hover chocs to the Oompa-Loompa to repay his debts, but the three men and Father Julius eat the chocolates, and Lofty appears and rescues Willy and Noodle. Confronting the Cartel and the Chief outside, Willy and Noodle expose their actions to the police and the public revealing the contents of the account book, and their chocolate is released through a water fountain, ruining their business. The Cartel uncontrollably levitates due to the hover chocs, while the Chief of Police is arrested. The crowd celebrates by tasting the chocolate containing Willy's ingredients. Willy unwraps his mother's chocolate bar, finding a golden ticket with a last message from his mother telling him that chocolate is best shared. Willy shares his mother's chocolate with his friends. Willy helps Noodle reunite with her birth mother, Dorothy Smith (Tracy Ifeachor), who works in the library. Willy pays off his debt to Lofty, but he says he could do with some help when he opens a new factory, he needs a ""Chief Taster"". Willy purchases an abandoned castle and with Lofty helps to build the Wonka factory. Meanwhile, Scrubitt and Bleacher are arrested trying to hide evidence of sabotaging Wonka's shop, and eating his chocolates, they are turned into the Twits. Also starring Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Officer Affable, Simon Farnaby (also writing) as Zoo Security Guard Basil, Charlotte Ritchie as Barbara, Phil Wang as Colin, Ellie White as Gwennie (Mistress of the Keys), Sophie Winkleman as The Countess, Murray McArthur as Ship Captain, Peep Show's Isy Suttie as Fruit & Veg Vendor, Colin O'Brien as Young Willy Wonka, Rufus Jones as Jenkins, Tim Fitzhigham as Sinister Ship Captain, Susie Fairfax as Abacus Crunch's Wife, Coronation Street's Ian Bartholomew as Sceptical Old Man, Justin Edwards as Green-Skinned Customer, Miranda's Dominic Coleman as Donovan, and Alison Pargeter as Wendy Chucklesworth. Chalamet is likeable as the aspiring constantly positive upcoming candy man, Colman and Davis are a great double act as the mean workhouse owners, Joseph, Lucas and Baynton enjoy themselves as the pantomime villains, young Lane gives a confident performance as Wonka's assistant, and Grant as the pompous wisecracking little creature is hilarious, spotting recognisable acting and comic talents is the cast is fun as well. There are some nice songs written by The Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon, including ""A Hatful of Dreams"", ""You've Never Had Chocolate Like This"" and ""A World of Your Own"", and the return of classic songs ""The Oompa-Loompa Song"" and ""Pure Imagination"" with slightly altered lyrics is good. As an origins story for the young chocolate factory character it works well, it is full of likeable characters, a charming Dickensian atmosphere, with colourful costumes and set pieces, there are some good laughs to be had, the family will all have fun with this little bite of magic, a sweet and enjoyable musical fantasy. Very good!","

Timothee Chalamet showed a quick-witted side of Willy Wonka that not even Gene Wilder could top. Wonka was exuberant and flashy, but not over the top. The Oompa-Loompas dawned the same orange skin green hair from the original and the iconic Oompa-Loompa music that the reboot butchered. The ""Chocolate Cartel"" was a laughable villain, but Slugworth (finally getting screentime) was a truly despisable antagonist.Wonka was a great watch for me, and I highly recommend that you watch it with your children (if you're old) or your parents (if you're young), or at least a dog or cat.","

While there were some visually stunning moments, most of the film was draped in old English overcast cobblestone. Drab & dull. Bring me Tim Burton, Johnny Depp & Danny Elfman any day of the week over this mess. Save your money and wait for it to hit the streaming platforms, or better still, save yourself some time and skip it all together. From a huge fan of the book, the original movie and of Ronald Dahl, I am said the see the legacy has been reduced to this pile of a film. Do better, Hollywood. Do better.","

Wonka," A somewhat bland prequel with a sweet edge.
",movieman6-413-929510,10-Dec-23,"Wonka is a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. This prequel was directed and partly written by Paul King, the director of the two Paddington films.Young Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) tries to bring more flavor to the world with his own unique chocolate. When he tries to do this with his own chocolate sales, Willy gets into trouble with the chocolate cartel. This cartel is run by Slugworth (Patterson Joseph), who runs the chocolate trade in more corrupt, dishonest ways.Together with Noodle (Calah Lane) and the fellow residents of Willy's new apartment complex, they secretly try to go against Slugworth's chocolate trade, so that people can enjoy different chocolates and other sweets from Willy Wonka's unique recipes and preparation methods in fairer ways. .
The book adaptation of Roald Dahl, his book about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory, was well received around 1971. They managed to make this film unique, once in the chocolate factory with colorful environments filled with different sweets. What further made this film unique was the acting of Gene Wilder, who managed to make the role of Willy Wonka his own with his own creative input.In 2005, the film was remade with Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. This remake was directed by Tim Burton, who also gave the film his own twist, which made the film a bit more unusual and dark.Now with this prequel to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, Timothée Chalamet gets the opportunity to make the role and the origin story a little more personal and develop it further. Unfortunately, he continues to play the role a bit safer and within the lines. As a result, the younger version of Willy Wonka misses his mysterious, special sides. Timothée Chalamet's singing is good, but seems a bit less pure compared to Gene Wilder's singing. Fortunately, other cast members know how to provide better and more appropriate singing, such as Calah Lane.In the original film, it takes about the first 45 minutes of the film for Willy Wonka's character to emerge in the film. In this prequel you get to see this character from the beginning, but after about an hour and fifteen minutes his fledgling chocolate factory really makes an appearance. In the beginning you follow Willy Wonka more as an illegal street seller of chocolate, while he tries to stay out of the hands of the chocolate cartel. This gives the film a different atmosphere. Once you get closer to the chocolate factory, the film may seem a bit more familiar. However, the film does miss some of the unique magical environments that the original film had. In the original film, Willy Wonka's helpers, the Oompa Loompas, were played by small actors. In this film, an Oompa Loompa is played by Hugh Grant, who is transformed into Oompa Loompa with special effects. This way, credibility is lost somewhat. Sometimes it can also come across as a bit unusual thanks to the visual effects. Because more use is made of visual effects, this film may seem less believable compared to the original film.This way, this film can become a new youth film for the modern generation, who can grow up with this film. Furthermore, the film may also be entertaining for fans of Timothée Chalamet.","

Such a waste of Timothee. The story wasn't connected to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was very disappointing. Chocolates didn't look good at all. Wonka looked already rich and successful guy from the beginning which was funny. Western people seem to like the first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I like the second one the best. Love Tim Burton's world. If I have to say something good about this movie, it's Oompa-Loompa's dance, but why did they cast Hugh Grant for Oompa-Loompa?","

All of them are names that have gone far beyond proving themselves. Our lead character, Timothée Chalamet, is young but has done some very good acting lately. They all fulfilled their roles very well. The script is pretty average, although it has a few shining parts. The main material is very suitable for high quality work without any boundaries in terms of scenario, stage art and musicality. The main work, Charlie's Chocolate Factory, is a work about pushing the limits of imagination. Even though there were a few fantastic elements in the movie, it felt quite weak to me in this aspect. It feels a little sad to imagine what this film could have been in the hands of a visionary.","

Abigail the giraffe, an evil Catholic priest played by Mr. Bean, and a solitary Oompa Loompa not portrayed by German midgets, but still singing, complete the ensemble.The film weaves together a medley of typical modern cliches, from the plight of enslaved token orphans to the sinister machinations of wealthy villains. Singing becomes a recurrent theme, with good-natured helpers and elderly gentlemen inexplicably assisting Wonka at every turn. The narrative is punctuated by mundane singing scenes, approximately every 5 minutes, featuring cheesy choreography. Notable characters include Abigail the giraffe, an evil Catholic priest amusingly portrayed by Mr. Bean, and a lone Oompa Loompa, deviating from the traditional German midget portrayal, yet still belting out tunes.","

It was so boring. I think I fell asleep a few times. The storyline did not take us on a full journey as the previous Willy Wonkas. If you're saying you can't compare, its hard not to. This story gives off the impression that if you have the imagination then anything can happen, but forgets to mention that it takes hard work to get to that point. It takes money not just imagination. The Wonka of 2023 was made for the new Generation. If you're a fan of Gen Wilder and Johnny Depp version then be prepared because you just may not like 2023 Wonka.","

As for the actors, this is the first time I've seen Thimothée Chalamet act, and he didn't convince me. On the other hand, the supporting cast is remarkable, with young Calah Lane's ""Noodle"" and especially Hugh Grant's ""Oompa-Loompa"" literally stealing the show!

",piispanenella,17-Jan-24,"Timothee Chalamet was the right choice to play Wonka. He was charming and captured a new side to the character hasnt been done before. Remakes are always tricky in that regard. This was more of a kids movie than I had anticipated, nevertheless I enjoyed it all in all. I didnt really enjoy the musical numbers. The singing was satisfactory but never excellent. The costume design and colours of the Wonka world where great though. The most disappointing part of this movie for me was the plot. I was hoping to see how Willy Wonka became the Wonka as in how he built the chocolate factor and how he found the Oompa Loompas (which granted that was slightly touched upon). However, the plot was a completely new story featuring a girl named Noodle and a bunch of characters whose names I dont remember indebted to an unfair Inn owner played by Olivia Coleman. They try and try to escape with the help of Wonka and his chocolates. The story isnt bad at all but it was disappointing as I was expecting somethign that was very specific to Willy Wonka and rather the movie gave a story that I felt like I had seen before.","

Beyond that it gets messy.The biggest sin is the incredibly unoriginal innkeepers and their list of charges for the stay.... Hello, are you doing a Willy Wonka backstory or a remake of Les Miserables?Willy Wonda the magician or chocolate maker? This show makes him look like more of a magician. He pulls an endless array of items out of his hat ala Mary Poppins' carpetbag. This does not jive with the source material.Slugworth in this film resembles a Bond villain more than a rival chocolatier. He even puts Wonka and Noodle in a Bond Villain type death trap.

Wonka," A warm hug of a film
",DanLawson146,26-Dec-23,"POSITIVES:1) Timothée Chalamet is absolutely brilliant here. The singing, dancing, charm and emotion are all present in abundance and I really wasn't expecting him to be so great
2) I thought the songs were very good and the dance choreography that accompanies a lot of them was also very impressive. ""A world of your own"", ""Pure imagination"", ""For a moment"" and ""Sweet tooth"" were real highlights for me
3) As the title of this review suggests, I found the film to be incredibly heartwarming and endearing. I thought the friendship between Wonka and Noodle was extremely powerful and in general I just thought the whole film made me feel better about the world and come out of the cinema with a spring in my step
4) Casting Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa was a stroke of genius. He's brilliant and his signature level of wit and sarcasm still shines throughNEGATIVES (all very small and nitpicky):1) Chalamet's line delivery at times was too cringey for me; ""land ahoy"" and ""absolutely insane"" are the two examples that immediately spring to mind
2) The character of Larry the comedian was so annoying and just felt completely unnecessary
3) There were a couple of times where characters throw and catch things and the cutting / editing of those moments was poor
4) I understand that it's a kid's film, but it always really bothers me in films when villains don't take the easy opportunity to finish off the hero. The chocolate cartel are completely okay with blowing up the boat Wonka is on when he tries to leave the city, but they don't shoot him when they're pointing a gun directly at him in their underground lair?? Instead they decide to slowly submerge him in chocolate instead for some reason??","

Wonka," Pointless
",jon-67-958809,28-Jan-24,"A hideous movie that attempts to give us the backstory of the Willy Wonka from the even more hideous 1971 Hollywood bag of tosh entitled Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which Roald Dahl himself hated.I really didn't see the point of this movie. It doesn't really tell us anything worth knowing about Willy Wonka, and even dares to radically change the Oompa Loompa backstory as told in Roald Dahl's books., in a way that makes absolutely no sense. It introduces a whole bunch of extraneous one-episode characters. Wonka himself is lightweight and lacking substance, with not a hint of darkness or creative charisma. All the songs are needless and throwaway, and the many attempts at big, Oliver-style street choreography numbers fall totally flat. The trio of Slugworth, Fickelgruber and Prodnose are a bore, and even performances by the likes of Olivia Coleman, one of the great comic character actors of our time, are insufficient to elevate this sorry excuse for a story beyond what it truly is... an ill-conceived, cynical attempt to capitalise on one of the greatest icons of children's literature.For me, this film will always represent one hour and fifty six minutes of my life I'll never get back.If you want to avoid making the same mistake, here's my three-step programme:1. Buy the books Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator
2. Read the books
3. If you must watch a movie of the books, watch the Tim Burton film from 2005 which is almost entirely faithful apart from a bit of extraneous backstory.","

Wonka," A beautifully conceived fairy tale about the origins of Willy Wonka.
",fciocca,14-Jan-24,"""Wonka"" tells the origins of the famous chocolate maker telling how his small business started. The staging is dreamy, but also grimy, creating a wonderful mix of different styles that merge well together. The directing of Paul King perfectly captures the mood of the film. The symmetry of the sets makes some sequences extremely engaging. The CGI is overall good and it blends seamlessly with the real environments. Unfortunately the oompa loompas played by Hugh Grant did not look up to today's VFX standards. I can pass over this issue, considering that in this film the character was very marginal, but in case of a sequel, this is an aspect that they definitely need to improve.As per tradition of every Wonka movie, this is a musical, and I truly enjoyed the songs that were very catchy and not too invasive, giving space to well written dialogues that made the story flow. I believe that the length of the movie was perfect, the film goes straight to the point. All the flashbacks displayed serve a purpose. This is how a fairy-tale is supposed to be: simple, short and sweet. I believe that this is one of those movies that both children and adults can watch and truly enjoy equally, and this for me is quite an achievement. Timothée Chalamet showed once again to be versatile and I believe that here shone, as he was able to demonstrate his skills as a singer and a dancer. Happy to see one of my all-time favorite actresses Olivia Colman, who was the comic shoulder, together with Tom Davis. I was glad to see Keegan-Michael Key who is always able to make me laugh, no matter the role. ""Wonka"" uses a lot of tropes, so the story is predictable. However it works, and not all movies need to be groundbreaking anyway. In my perspective it is definitely worth a watch, possibly to the cinema.

He is supposed to have a darker side but just feels like a lost teenager and has no scene presence whatsoever. Many other good actors/actresses do a great performance and makes the movie watchable but I do wish Hollywood stops casting these young actors just because they are pretty to look at when they have no clue how to act and express emotions.

The ratio in the first one was about 20% dreary to 80% hope. And that's one the main reasons it did so well.It's really depressing to see such a great cast and movie be ruined by something as stupid as ""let's fight greed as the plot."" The people who wrote this, have lost the thread of just how valuable not just saying that imagination matters is, but actually watching it is. Watching this movie was just watching someone attempt to be great and be repeatedly shut down until they became corrupt enough to play dirty enough to win. Which is not hope, it's just lazy.

Wonka," A lot of potential but didn't hit the mark and as a prequel it disappointed
",joanaaguiar40,28-Dec-23,"This movie was charming, entertaining, sweet (pun intended) and there were also moments of great acting that didn't go unnoticed, however a couple of things absolutely threw me off/disappointed me.First of all, I really like Chalamet and I think he's a fine actor and he was very charming in this. However, he didn't fully incorporate or commit to the level of extravaganza, wittiness and lunacy that Willy Wonka the character asks for. Perhaps Depp's performance in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which I find absolutely outstanding, conditioned my viewing of Wonka, but even if both interpretations are supposed to be independent from each other, having seen Depp's, the bar was set really high for Timothee and he failed to hit the mark. I would have love to see that naïve lunacy Depp's interpretation had in this movie too.Second, I didn't like the songs. And this is a biggy for a musical. They weren't catchy enough, witty enough, and sometimes even the metric felt off. I think for a movie with this budget, something much more impressive could have been done.Finally, and this one isn't an actual critique because perhaps it doesn't have the right to be so, I didn't like the backstory about Wonka's childhood because it broke the magic for me as a viewer that loves the character across both films to have two different childhoods. Different childhood, different man. Moreover, Wonka's childhood in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a lot more wicked and strange, a lot more Willy, and it also makes more sense regarding who Willy turns out to be as an adult. This ruined, for me, that part of the plot.These are the three major flaws that made this movie a disappointment to me, but for kids it still is a fun, quirky and inspiring movie!","

After watching so many kids movies that are overstimulating and have the most boring plots this was a breath of fresh air. I don't understand the low reviews but if you're expecting it to be like the 70s version I guess you were always going to be disappointed, Roald Dahl hated the original Wonka movie, I never read the book but I feel like this movie is closer to Dahl's work than the others.

As it turns out, Willy is illiterate.Not being able to pay the bill when he wants to leave, Mrs Scrubbitt locks Willy up in the basement together with a few other 'unfortunately tenants', who now does tasks around the house to ""pay off their debt"".'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' from 1971 starring Gene Wilder as the titular character had a fantastic production design, and a thought-provoking underlying theme. In 2005 the film was remade as 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. That film, too, revolved around a boy named Charlie, and the film had a much deeper meaning to it than the candy-coated façade it presented. This version of Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory relies heavily on visuals to captivate the audience. I found the story and the characters too slapstick - especially Mrs Scrubbit (even her very name!) and her henchman Bleacher, who were downright silly characters and aimed to entertain a young demographic.'Wonka' is beautifully theatrical, with an impressive production design and good visuals. They do attempt a deeper meaning to the film with regards to Noodle, but sadly it fell flat. There's so much slapstick and satire here that there's no room for a deeper underlying tone. This is by every definition a children's movie.","

Wonka," A sweet and lovable film that captures the imagination and wonder of Roald Dahl's world and characters, even if the titular Wonka is somewhat lacking in his diabolical side
",IonicBreezeMachine,27-Dec-23,"After seven years traveling abroad looking for exotic flavors, aspiring chocolatier Willy Wonka (Timothee Chalamet) arrives in Europe eager to establish himself. While his chocolates prove immensely popular, a trio of chocolatiers consisting of Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton) use their connections with the Chief of Police (Keegan-Michael Key) to force Willy away from selling chocolate. With no means of selling his wares, Willy winds up in a massive amount of debt at a boarding house run by Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis) and forced to work in their laundry to work off his debt. With the help of Scrubitt's orphaned ward Noodle (Calah Lane), Wonka and his assortment of friends who are also debtors of Mrs. Scrubitt craft a plan to upend the chocolate cartel.Wonka is the third theatrical incarnation of the characters from Roald Dahl's 1964 children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory following the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the first to not be directly based upon the book. Development on a new Willy Wonka film began in 2016 when Warner Bros. Reacquired the rights to the Wonka character from Dahl's estate with the intention later revealed to be making the film a prequel to the 1971 film detailing Wonka's origins. Paul King was selected as director based on the success of his work with the Paddington films, and even reteamed with some of his collaborators from Paddington 2 on writing the screenplay. Critical and audience reception has been very positive with Wonka also being credited with revitalizing the movie musical genre which has struggled at the box office since 2020. Wonka is a very sweet and agreeable film that tries to do right by the source material, even if it's placement as a prequel is somewhat undercut by its portrayal of the titular Wonka.From a purely technical point of view, Wonka is a gorgeous looking film. The production is certainly to be commended as the nameless European city in which Wonka takes place feels timeless and is rich in details from the busy din of the Galleries Gourmet to the purposefully unpleasant Scrubbit & Bleacher that carries more than a few shades of Roald Dahl's The Twits, Wonka creates a world that is beautiful and sweet while still possessing a bit of Dahl's signature edge and bite. The movie also features a bevy of notable British character actors in major or supporting roles with the likes of Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, and Olivia Colman being but a few whose presence adds to the engaging nature of the world created. Keegan-Michael Key is very funny as the corrupt Chief of Police who does the chocolate cartels bidding, and a running gag about how he's bribed in chocolate is very amusing and very Dahl like. But stealing every scene he's in is none other than Hugh Grant who plays Oompa-Loompa Lofty and his relationship with Wonka and how he came to be involved is very amusingly done with a rendition ""Oompa Loompa"" repurposed from 1971 original.I think this does lead into one of the weak points with the movie which is the soundtrack. While all the music is fine and sounds and looks good in the moment, I think the lack of differentiation among the presentation of the songs prevents any of them from standing out in a big way and it speaks volumes how the songs Pure Imagination and Oompa Loompa from the original film are included here and overshadow the new ones. We also have Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka and while he has a likable and engaging screen presence, I never felt like he was going to become Gene Wilder's Wonka from the 1971 film. While thankfully Chalamet's interpretation largely avoids the unnerving vision Burton and John August brought to the 2005 character, the Paddington influence really shows as Chalamet possesses all the whimsy you expect from Wonka but without the diabolical edge instead presented as a naive innocent dreamer to a fault. From the fact Wonka has a very pronounced motivation of fulfilling ""his mamma's dream"", his overly trusting and generous nature, and the fact he can't read it does feel like they've tried to copy that same Paddington feel to Wonka which I'm not sure is all that successful. Sometimes Chalamet is allowed to convey a more diabolical side to his character with his usage of stage magic and illusion to evade the police, but it's often overtaken by the focus on sweetness and innocence that Paul King and Simon Farnaby are more inclined towards.In terms of cinematic depictions of Willy Wonka, Wonka is a marked improvement from the 2005 film while not reaching the level of the 1971 original. While the film's production, atmosphere, and supporting performances are incredibly well done, the music is pleasant without standing out and Chalamet while likable in the lead role never sold me as an early version of Gene Wilder's take on the character. A pleasant enough experience especially if you enjoyed the Paddington films, but I don't expect to revisit Wonka in the same way I revisit Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.","

Wonka," Fun, wacky, fanciful, and full of heart!
",mishahaynie,27-Dec-23,"This is a prequel to the original 1971 film and the 2005 Tim Burton remake. It's directed by the same director of the Paddington Bear movies. He manages to capture the love and fantasy of this Willy Wonka magically. It's not going to be anything compared to the original movies, but it's its own and it is delightful in every way. I was apprehensive about going to see this because I'm not a big Willy Wonka fan, but by the end of this movie, I think it really surpasses the previous films tenfold. I ended up loving it because it's full of heart. I think that's what a lot of movies forget nowadays. This movie was just full of passion and spirit. Roald Dahl and his family has been very apprehensive in the past about adapting his beloved books into movies, and without question, I think this is a wonderful recreation of his work. Timothée Chalamet really embodies the spirit of Wonka in his portrayal. Some essence of this performance can be a little odd, but he looks and fits the part very well. But the standout highlight performance of this movie that really knocked my socks off was Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. And yes, you heard that right. They CGI'd his head onto an Oompa Loompa body. I heard from sources, the director said he wouldn't have made the movie without Hugh Grant being a part of it for some reason, and it's one of the standout moments in the film that is just absolutely delightful. It makes it even more wacky and fun-spirited. If you want to take your family out to a really endearing movie that's going to lift your heart by the end and make you feel all bubbly and cheerful inside, definitely don't miss going to see Wonka! It will make your heart flutter with amazement!","

Wonka," Great christmas blockbuster
",martinpersson97,16-Dec-23,"I attended the premiere of this movie, and was not disappointed. You will definitely expect a well rounded, cozy and all around funny affair for all ages with this film - and very much a worthy addition to the traditions of great and thrilling blockbusters around christmas times.Like a majority of people, I have of course watched the original film, yet it has been quite a few years. This film is more of a new adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel rather than a traditional prequel, however, so it stands well on its own. But like many great homages, it does pay its tribute to the original film in many clever ways.It is an all around funny, cozy and fun affair in the style of a great matinee adventure - splendid, colorful and memorable characters, catchy and memorable soundtracks and things that will stretch your imagination, to say the least!Definitely a great family adventure in the vein of Doctor Dolittle, The Wizard of Oz, or, dare I even say, The Sound of Music, to an extent.Overall, definitely a highlight of the year, highly recommended for everyone, regardless of age. I am sure most will appreciate this.","

Wonka," It fell short
",Dickiebyrne,19-Dec-23,"I can't put my finger on it, the film just lacked something for me, the music didn't hit the toe tapping quality it maybe could have. The songs over time might enter my most listened tunes for 2024 but interestingly the only time my ears pricked up were when I heard the notes towards the end for pure imagination. The set design and atmosphere were well done but didn't quite hit the magical notes you'd expect for Wonka. Olivia Coleman and Tom Davis were enjoyable but Wonka's sidekicks were sadly mostly forgettable. I enjoyed Keegan's ever increasing waistline over the film's length as he continued to sell himself out but would have liked a bit more menace from the three chocolatiers to offer a bit more jeopardy to the good guys.Hugh Grant was enjoyable and could have been sprinkled in a bit more across the film. Chalamet performed the role admirably, I'm not sure you need to have the qualities of a Gene Kelly to act and sing on film to perform these sorts of roles so he coped well enough with what was required of him.All in all a perfectly good 2 hours revisiting a children's classic and a welcome change from watching a string of below par superhero films.","

Hugh Grant for playing the ompaa loompa was absolutely fantastic. The singing was just like gene wilders version . Slugwoorth was the funniest villain in wonka . Noodle was the best part of the movie . Learning her story of her family is sad and very touching. Wonkas mother was very inspiring for the candy man .

While this is a entertaining movie for both children and adults (as proved from me glancing at my siblings during the movie), I really felt they still kept the vibe rold dhal would've had in his movies :D.","

Wonka," Worthy Prequel to the Original Classic
",Reviews_of_the_Dead,27-Dec-23,"This was a movie that I'll was intrigued to check out. Growing up, I loved Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I've never seen the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton film all the way through, but it didn't work for me like the original. I also believe that I had a teacher in elementary school read the book to us as a class. Jaime was excited when this was coming to theater so we made a date night to check it out.What we get here is a prequel to the story we know. I'll credit that for the most part, this could lead to the Gene Wilder version. Timothée Chalamet looks like him. I could even make the case that this one is beaten down by the world to be Gene. What we get here though is that Willy Wonka arrives back in what seems like the business sector of the town where he grew up with his mother. He wants to try his hand at selling chocolates. Wonka is a bit gullible and is stopped by a cartel of chocolate makers. They're made up of Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton). The police are in on it, the chief is Keegan-Michael Key.Wonka is also taken advantage of by not reading the fine print of a local boarding house. It is run by Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman) with the help of Bleacher (Tom Davis), who is her muscle. Wonka is forced to pay his debts for staying there. It is here that he meets Noodle (Calah Lane), who tries to help him. Also working in the laundry with Wonka are Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar), Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell) and Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher).It will take planning and guile, but Wonka is set to share his chocolate with the world, just like his mother wanted. It could be more difficult when there could be a little orange man taking his product and plus, he has to overcome the chocolate cartel as well as their network of bribes.What I'll say is that I had a blast here. Chalamet is a great Wonka. He can sing, dance and he's quirky to take on the role. I do love that he's navigating a world that takes advantage of him. Despite the odds, he does keep that chipper attitude that the character needs. What is interesting here though and I'll go back to something I said already, I could see him becoming the character from the beloved classic. I also like that character names share names with candy or other things in the Wonka world. The acting around Chalamet is great as well.Something else I appreciate here is that this movie made me laugh. It also put me in my feels with Wonka's backstory. Seeing what he has to go through to succeed also tugs at the heartstrings. There's also the story of Noodle trying to find out what happened to her family. Piecing that together brought a tear to my eye. There's also commentary here about capitalism that I appreciated. This is showing Wonka trying to break a monopoly on selling chocolate. It could be transferred to other things as well.Then to go over filmmaking, I love that this captures the spirit of Wonka. We also get a bleak and hard world so that split is great. It captures the heart of a Roald Dahl novel. There are fantastic things that you just have to accept. This does use CGI to bring that to life. In this day and age, not another way of doing it. There is money behind it so it looks good. I'll credit to that. This is a musical like every version. The songs aren't as iconic. I do think nostalgia is playing in there. What I will say is that I'm glad they did a version of the Pure Imagination song. That warmed my heart. I'll close this out by saying that if you love this story, give it a watch. I thought this was a worthy prequel to the original. It is a blast to watch.My Rating: 8 out of 10.","

Wonka," a nice but far from wonderful showing
",Special-K88,22-Jan-24,"The third live-action adaptation of Roald Dahl's much beloved children's novel chronicles everyone's favorite candymaker in his early days as an ambitious, itinerant young chocolatier who arrives in Europe hoping to perfect his craft. Naturally his path to chocolate bliss takes some detours, and he has to finagle the rotten, beady-eyed proprietors of a boarding house, as well as the corrupt, imposing Chocolate Cartel if he hopes to make his fortune. Not bad but not especially memorable this offers its share of warmth and charm, featuring affable characters and a couple of likable songs, along with a few nods to Mel Stuart's 1971 version, plus a jolly, vigorous display from Timothée Chalamet who carries the role of a winsome, wide-eyed Willy Wonka with aplomb. Despite a good message and some sweet (no, not the candy kind) moments sewn in the final act is surprisingly ineffectual, but you'll probably like it even if you can't really love it. **½",NA
Wonka," Delightful production, dark allegory
",malmevik77,18-Dec-23,"WonkaThis film continues a pattern I've seen in films recently where the main character hides their own pain by producing things that make other people happy, insisting that it boosts their own happiness. This, as expected, is not true, as the underlying pain continues even after a goal is reached. With Wonka, he produces chocolates of varying exotic and magical degrees so that when he reaches a goal of perceived success, that his pain will lessen or end. I'm reading into this too much, but I couldn't help but picture what the movie would have been like if chocolate has been replaced by drug addiction. They certain portray chocolate as a drug, even using the word cartel to describe those who sell their product.What follows next is a wacky and musical journey where others join his cause in order to escape literal but ridiculous imprisonment. The motives of the others are touched on, but attention is mostly paid to Noodle, an orphan girl. There are inconsistenices in the storyline about the nature of perceived corruption in law enforcement and about the ease of sneaking out of a years long depiction of slavery after it is first deemed impossible.However, I still loved the movie enough to look past that due to the use of colors, songs, wild exuberance, an elegant giraffe, and a silly character played by Rowan Atkinson. In accordance with the chocolate equals drugs, even the members of the church become corrupt to continue receiving their ""fix"".Of course, the movie ends as expected, with Wonka building his famous factory, to continue producing a better form of addictive substances. Maybe my addictive personality found joy in this never ending cycle of taking or making more of something to lessen one's own pain. Even with Wonka letting go of his original motive for making chocolate, he continues to do so, to inspire happiness in a dreary existence.Yes I loved it and recommend it, but it didn't sit right after thinking too much. Face value: it's a sweet treat with happy endings.","

Wonka," A Cinematic Confection of Delight and Emotion
",badeclerck,06-Jan-24,"Wonka, directed by Paul King, unfolds as a cinematic experience that, despite my initial hesitations, managed to capture the sweet essence of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory universe while breathing new and exhilarating life into it.Right from the opening seconds, the film takes the form of a musical comedy, an exuberant dance that immerses us in the singular ambiance of Wonka. These initial moments adeptly set the tone of the film, unveiling the goals and first encounters of the iconic character.One of the film's great successes lies in its impeccable pacing that keeps the viewer's attention constantly engaged. My initial concerns of potential mismanagement of the precious memories from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory dissipated as the plot unfolded. Each scene is meticulously placed, contributing significantly to the final resolution, a sign of skillful and thoughtful writing.Wonka is not merely a sequel but a rebirth of the beloved universe. The film cultivates a feel-good atmosphere from start to finish, offering a welcome dose of music, smiles, humor, and delightfully quirky characters. It all merges into a cinematic symphony that delights the senses and nourishes the soul.The pleasure also lies in the in-depth exploration of Wonka's character, revealing his past and weaving a touching relationship with his mother. These elements add an emotional layer to the story, making Wonka not only eccentric but also a human and vulnerable figure.In summary, Wonka is a cinematic adventure that succeeds where many feared failure. It respects Roald Dahl's universe while offering a fresh and refreshing perspective. Paul King has created a work that celebrates the magic of cinema and the delights of chocolate, making Wonka a deliciously sweet and memorable cinematic experience.","

Wonka," Good But Not Great [7/10]
",panagiotis1993,21-Jan-24,"This is my Live Reaction / Review for Wonka (2023): Im not the biggest fan of musicals and I know nothing about Willy Wonka the character but im willing to give this a chance. Wonka seems to have crazy magic skills. Chocolate that makes you fly? Now that's funny. Wonka should have read the paper before signing it, so dumb or maybe just innocent? I didn't know that giraffes could produce milk like that. Now they can fly? That's so cool and fun.The musical parts are good but something is missing, i expected better songs and dancing. I would prefer something more catchy I guess. Its kinda funny that Wonka doesn't know how to read. I love how in this movie instead of money the police officers just want chocolate, it's funny. Someone poisoned the chocolates? Didnt see that coming but its funny. They are willing to give him so much money to quit and stop making chocolate? Wait is he gonna give up just like that? Wow, they tried to kill Wonka? That's so evil.Drama: 2/5

Wonka," Whimsy Delightful, And Family Focus
",rgkarim,16-Dec-23,"LIKES:The Setting
-We're back in the origins of the inventor, which means stepping back in time, and King's direction has executed tis well.-Glorious European design by trade brings an old timey delight that Wonka held long ago. Streets abuzz with society in these gorgeous streets of cramped alleys, large squares, and buildings that hold so much charm.-It provides that classic 1971 feel, but holds the Tim Burton charms and presentation at points to blend the world into a playground best for sharing candy treats.-As the movie progresses, the imagination comes to life to continue to give Dahl's extreme fantasy setting life, helping fill in with color, to what started as a very greyish world.The Costumes
-Adding even more personality are the various costumes that come into the works.-Certainly no Marvel or Star Wars, Wonka's elements again go back to tradition and matching the very evolution and practicality of fashion, as seen in various piece films.-The suits are straight and stiff, the dresses are flowing and conservative, but hold status, and the ""riff-raff"" have more character than the elite, that only continues to grow with each sale of chocolate.-And Wonka himself may not be the aura of personality like the other movies, but that traditional look is still there, has explanation, and like the others gradually shapes into the beginning of the madness.The Acting
-A solid cast to bring the life, King's recruitment of actors and actresses was delightful in bringing a Dahl story to life.-I'm going to focus on four in this cast, because the list is first billed, but be assured that King has brought together people to make a cast that fits in the Whimsical Wonka World.Keegan-Michael Key is a fun twist to his Christmas Movie on Netflix. He's a fun antagonist, gruff, but clumsy, using comedy as his forte to make things fun, and an expression that feels very child and goofy. Fantastic line delivery that felt like solid ad-libbing, he netted points for the fun feeling.Paterson Joseph as Slughorn is a fine leader of the Cartel. Malicious, conniving, greedy, and more fill his delivery with spice, but never quite losing that fairytale restraint for a movie to be too scary or loud in a kid's movie. An excellent blend of malice and silliness I expected.-Calah Lane a wonderful member who holds the heart and soul of Dahl's focus, the child aspect with adult lessons to learn. Lane brings a lot to her role as Noodle, a fantastic dreamer, but hard knock life delivery that is perfect for this movie. Her chemistry with Chalamet is spot on and I loved her engagement with the camera.-Of course Chalamet is the star and once again dips well into a movie with commitment, talent, and accuracy in getting an aspect of Wonka. He's charming, goofy, vulnerable, and inspiring all at once, and that hard combination is done well for much off the movie. Solid interactions, great physical acting, and that gleam he matches to Wilder's look long ago, quite chilling in just how good this guy is.The Story/Sentimentality
-It's a Dahl origin story, and while I don't know how much is from his notes and works, I must say it felt welcoming to the Wonka universe.-Wonka keeps to the writer's focus on fantasy worlds, good lessons, and the consequences that come from greed, all nicely portrayed in that same coy jab that we've seen.-Yet, the movie takes the musical element and starts to expand more on Wonka, adding these touching moments that Burton did that hold deeper ties and investment that further mold Wonka into something more.-And all while keeping it fun for kids, the stories that come together have sentimental value, and keep to elements of fun Wonka's world is known to have.The Music To A Degree
-It's a musical, and you need music. Fortunately, Wonka has you covered... at least to a degree.-The quality is spot on for a theater visit, great use of instruments, tight control over vocals, and a solid use of technology to get you into the number.-Each song does add that Dahl story telling twist, one part moral boosting, one part character examining, and plenty of parts aspiration and dreams that Wonka always sings for the audience.-There are touching piano solos, blends of splendid instruments blaring, and the numbers themselves have elements that feel like others, helping boost the themes and messages as only movies can.-That's the delight of the Wonka music to a reviewer and fan like me.The Special Effects
-Better than the original, technology evolution has done much to help make these worlds come to life.-Wonka, to me, feels like a theater show with special effects of the cinema, glorious sets that only computers and a studio can make to help add that immersion factor.-Several accidents have much better evolution than 1971, with chocolate, candy, and other delights matching that look of Burton's studio.-And to keep the animation looking real with what looks practical and CGI mixed, again a solid entry in my eyes that really just brings Dahl's words to life.The Comedy
-By far one of my favorite elements is the comedy. A blend of adult and kid humor that never crosses the line to inappropriate.-Wonka's stumbling and naivety, the sarcasm of Noodle, the idiocy of the constable and the villains... it all works in a nice balanced use to relieve the moments.-The winner is Hugh Grant, an Oompa Loompa with attitude, sarcasm, and quite honestly the most traditional Wonka charm of the bunch. Perhaps an influence to the latter, perhaps not, he was my favorite element in use that blends older humor tastes, with new generation flair.The Charming Feeling
-What ties it all together is the charm and delight of the Wonka-verse in this movie.-Paul King has done this tirelessly in his movies, and Wonka somehow has that youthful feeling that still speaks to the kid inside of me.-Like Paddington, this movie just holds so much, speaks so deep, and is just a fun escape that got me back into the movies and away from the Internet wars.-That's why this film has the heart and shininess to it, and makes for a good time out with groups at just how much the hope, inspiration, and struggles you can see without getting too lost in ""new directions.""DISLIKES:The Pacing Inconsistency
-There are times the movie is slow as molasses, slogging through awkward world building, and the first day struggles on the town.-Then there are times where it's like The Flash has taken over and achieved the impossible, or maybe shown how far work ethic has fallen.-Either way, Wonka's issue is time balance, editing that took out a lot and made an inconsistent up and down that could have had better use.-It's not the worst, but, I wonder what potential it had if these elements could have been extended or smoothed out on the story, numbers, and fun.The Plot Hole Issues
-Let's get this out, we don't know if this a true prequel or if this is a new start based on the Internet, so let's just focus on this movie.-Wonka's got great consistency, but again, there are things that don't make sense that I can't say too much to spoil.-Let's just say the crafting element seems a bit too fantasy, some of the building opportunities are a bit too fast, and the suspense of disbelief a tad more than what a Dahl story had.-I'd have liked to see time balance help iron this out, and perhaps more time to talk, but again, this movie was doing a lotMissing Wonka's Darker Wit
-Wonka is coy, sarcastic, and a bit of a darker and sterner side to his comedy. I missed that in this movie.-Yet, as this is before the infamous spy ordeal, I get why it might not be there and we only see the dreamer side.-Story aside, missing that sarcasm and that comedic spike was something I held, fortunately filled by the Oompa Loompa that would accompany about a third of the movie.The Music On Another Role
-By far the most disappointing to me, is the splendor of the music and the unique quality
-Frozen, Greatest Showman, La La Land, and others are better to me in terms of variety of musical numbers than this film, a shame given the potential of the director and the world.-Wonka's music is good quality, but many numbers start out the same, many have the same build up and opening, then kind of get different later in the song.-Not that they aren't good, but without the visual elements to help, the songs didn't have quite the portfolio of originality that I had hoped, leaving me disappointed that the musical element sort of flopped outside of the Wonka dream tone.The VERDICT
It may not be a dive into the factory, but Wonka turns out to be one of the most fun movies I've seen in a very long time. That whimsical nature and Paul King's direction, really blends youth and experience together diving back into the world that grabbed me at five years old. It's a quality world building and special effects use, enough to make the impossible, possible, but never overwhelm it. A family film with so much charm, it really was a fun dive into the origins and escapism that made a theater visit fun with the technology ad songs. Such a charming cast and tight direction made this movie worth every penny, and though missing some variety, some of that factory wit, and even a little more of the adult fortitude, Wonka accomplished a lot and made the whole experience super fun and engaging to say the least. I find this movie to be quite worth a recommendation, and hope that under King's direction, we get a few more installments into this world of Wonka. My scores of this musical melody movie are:Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5.","

Wonka," Every good thing in this world started with a dream
",Cinema-reviewer321,13-Feb-24,"I like the first movie adaptation Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) with its good performances and songs, but the second movie adaptation Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) by Tim Burton was simply good enough with ok performances and a unique style from Tim Burton; so, I am interested on what you can do with a Willy Wonka prequel. The prequel movie Wonka (2023) was very enjoyable to watch with great performances, nice songs, over the top antagonists that fit the tone of the movie, and favorable effects; what made the movie nice to watch was Timothée Chalamet as the character Willy Wonka because of how likable he is throughout the movie, and that the actor pulled off some of the strange qualities of his personality.Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka does an excellent job portraying him as a likable and strange character that you like watching, and see him progress in the chocolate making business by making lots of unique kinds of chocolate and making the chocolate with lots of weird ingredients; he has quite a few emotional moments that are effective, and you want him to get through the many obstacles in his way to achieve his goal of becoming a famous chocolatier. Willy Wonka's friend he makes named Noodle played by Calah Lane, who is also particularly good in the movie, helps Willy Wonka with his goal because he helped her in bringing chocolate into her life and sort out the backstory with her parents; I liked the friendship between her and Willy Wonka, and thought they worked well together. Though not in the movie that much, Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa breaking in and stealing chocolate from where Willy Wonka is staying was funny to watch, and he had beneficial effects for the look of him and how he acted, along with an occasional song number from him.The antagonists being greedy chocolatiers that are part of the chocolate cartel were over the top in how they acted and treated Willy Wonka when makes chocolate that is too good making him a threat to their businesses, but was over the top enough to fit what the tone of the story, which was being lighthearted and whimsical; the other antagonist that is basically working for the greedy chocolatiers was the chief of police played by Keegan-Michael Key, the character had a sweet tooth for chocolate involving him gaining weight, which can be funny, along with Rowan Atkinson having a role in the movie. The songs in the movie are nice to listen to and were sung well; but also, there were a lot of nice-looking visuals of Wonka making the chocolate and the locations he goes to involving a zoo or the main square of the town he is selling his chocolate at.The prequel movie Wonka (2023) was very enjoyable to watch, with the lead character being likable to watch and the performances being well-done, I did not know what to expect with this movie; the movie had the whimsical lighthearted imagination of the original Willy Wonka & the chocolate Factory (1971) achieved with Gene Wilder. I think if you want a simple good musical and you like the original movie with Gene Wilder, then this movie will be likable enough for fans of the original, along with it just being an enjoyable time; it is not perfect, but the movie surprised me, and I got a delightful experience.","

Wonka," Took me back to my childhood
",rjal-1,09-Feb-24,"I am old enough to have seen the original in theatre. It has always been among my favs.This origin story was just as enchanting. I loved all of the Easter eggs which can only be noticed if you've seen the original more than a couple of times.Like the original and The Wizard of Oz, strangely, this film starts off in 'dark mode' where everything is dark and dreary. It kind of stays that way until the reveal of the chocolate room. Then it explodes with colour, dance and song. Classic!I love these types of films that awaken our sense of whimsy and have us harkening back to our childhood.I just saw it, so I am not going to say more until I watch it for another time and consider things like camera angles and editing which is all about the directors vision, which I also love to consider.I gave this a 10.","

Wonka," I got a cavity
",df4205,07-Feb-24,"Much like the Mary Poppins follow-up, this prequel to the much loved Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory falls flat at worst and mediocre at best. While it's not a horrible film, it falls well short of the bar set by the original staring Gene Wilder. Walking in the footsteps of a legendary, beloved classic is a near-impossible task as it is, but this film barely seems to try.The Music/Songs:The problem with modern day musicals, this one included, is that they're not songs - they're conversations set to a tune. While they sometimes meet the technical requirements of rhyme, getting there is quite ponderous as they fail badly in terms of meter. By the time a character has finished singing one sentence, I could've listened to three songs from the original. This, I think, is why the songs are largely unmemorable because each one requires us to essentially learn ""Modern Major General.""Compared to the original, these songs also seem largely lacking in point. Whether, as many others point out, they're far too frequent or some other reason, they just don't inspire a person to sing along. The original songs either gave us insight in to the character's state of mind, they're foibles, or their comeuppance. Here, its more like ""Ow, I stubbed my toe! It really hurt! I'll be walking funny all day!""The Characters:Grandpa Joe, Charlie, Veruca, and Willy are all timeless, well-known and had time to be explored/fleshed out. Heck, even the one-shot people like the scientist with the machine telling him it couldn't cheat and the psychiatrist demanding his patient tell him where a dream told him a ticket was had more personality and are more memorable than most folks we see here. The villains are cartoonish caricatures lifted right out of a Neil Breen film - Twirling their mustaches, talking openly about how evil they are, and doing incomprehensibly stupid things like keeping records of their misdeeds.Though Timothée Chalamet seems a capable actor, the writing for Willy Wonka doesn't give him much to work with. Here, Willy is presented as an ever-jolly fellow, constantly smiling and looking on the bright side of life. Does that seem even remotely like the enigmatic, wise-cracking, flippant, wise, distant, playful, fun-loving, often enraged and borderline psychotic Willy portrayed by Gene? The fun of the original Willy was that he could be all those things because from the time he 'fell' off his cane and did a roll you learned you could never know what to expect out of him from one moment to the next. This incarnation just doesn't seem the same man who would show such unbridled rage as during his ""You stole fizzy lifting drink,"" speech. Yes, people can change, but we should have gotten at least a hint of one of these other moods/behaviors during the movie, just to show him as being capable of capricious behavior.Final Thoughts:I agree with those that have already said it, it's a nice looking movie. The visuals and effects are excellent, but is that enough to carry a film? The original didn't have things like CGI and even adjusting for inflation, the budget for the original is a penny in the cup compared to this one, yet I can watch the original again and again and again...this movie just isn't going to get the same kind of love and devotion. While the actors do what they can, the movie winds up being too ""sweet"" for it's own good. The original was accessible to both adults and children alike, this one seems to lean heavily towards favoring children. There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but if you want your film to be timeless, you have to make it so adults aren't going to want to pull their hair out or to suddenly remember they need to cook a 2 and a half hour dinner.","

Wonka," While It's Not Perfect, It's Still A Good, Fun, And Enjoyable Imaginative Adventure Fills With Great Characters, Performances, And Musical
",HabibieHakim123,28-Dec-23,"8.5/10
The least i expected in Wonka was the musical being good and i actually really loved all the musical in Wonka and in fact the best thing in the movie, and the most i expected in Wonka was Chalamet portrayal is mostly gonna cringe me and guess what? He actually a good Wonka!, surprise me with this 2 hour of enjoyable magical adventure, a character adaptation from a lovable novel and character that surprisingly works, it's a very creative good imaginative story with good character development, good performances by all the cast, and fascinating production design, i grew up with the Johnny Depp version so Charlie And The Chocolate Factory always have a special place in my heart and always gonna be my favorite, just recently rewatch Gene Wilder version for the second time and overall it is still a good movie but at the end i already know about mostly everything in fact it wasn't even a complete story, Wonka however takes a whole new original story with a nod's here and there and i definitely felt more fresh watching Wonka than the Gene Wilder version and so i did like it a bit more, overall i can safely say that Paul King's Wonka did justice to the Willy Wonka character while it's not perfect, it's still a good, fun, and enjoyable imaginative adventure fills with great characters, performances, and musical, making it one of the most entertaining films of the year.","

Wonka," Pure Imagination
",marcslope,02-Jan-24,"Went to this kind of grudgingly, not being a fan of Timothee Chalamet and after seeing some so-so reviews. It was delightful! Still don't entirely get Chalamet, but he's game, sings at least as well as Gene Wilder, and dances a bit, quite capably. I didn't realize it was a brand-new story from Paul King, and it's quite a dexterous one, giving Wonka a credible origin story and allowing for plenty of sight gags, warmth, and satire.  Calah Lane is adorable, and there are fun turns from Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Colman, Rowan Atkinson, and, especially, Hugh Grant. It's visually sumptuous, especially in IMAX. The new songs, by somebody I never heard of, are just fine-OK, they have some lazy rhymes, but they tell the story, inform us about the characters, and generally do the heavy lifting musical scores used to do. It made me laugh out loud, and the ""secret message"" revealed at the end (but not here) is a charming, touching finishing touch. What a surprise this one was!","

Wonka," A Wonderful Watch
",kjproulx,26-Jan-24,"It was hard for me to not have some small expectations going into Wonka, simply because I am a huge fan of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. That original film from 1971 is a film I grew up watching many, many times. When I was younger I also liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I have since grown a distaste for it. In my eyes, after that Johnny Depp version, there was nowhere to go but up. I'm very happy that I got around to checking out Wonka though because it was just wonderful to watch. Far different from the other versions, here's why I recommend this one.Willy Wonka, a young man with aspirations of opening his own chocolate factory, works his way up the chain at a job that pays him almost nothing. With the help of some newfound friends, he may just have what he needs to get started. Sadly, he is being hunted by what the film calls ""The Chocolate Cartel,"" a group of people who wish to take Wonka down. His magic and wonder are too much for them and that scares them. This film is silly through and through. The villains all made me roll my eyes on multiple occasions, but Wonka was meant to be a family film and it more than succeeds at that.Even though I was watching this film based on the name alone, Paul King was the second reason. His writing and directing on both Paddington films was stellar. Those films are delightful and not only made for kids, but the emotional core and overall messages make them worth watching, and I feel the same way about Wonka. It's a fun, charming family film, but the way the film wraps up at the end had me in tears. It focuses on a lot of silliness to keep kids engaged, but I truly feel that adults will get more than they think out of the emotional ending, as well as the references to the original classic film (especially in the music).I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this film is first and foremost, a musical. The trailers don't exactly portray it as such, but there are quite a few musical numbers. I thought the musical aspect added to this film and brightened it up many times. Timothée Chalamet is also fantastic in the role, but he's great in everything, so I wasn't surprised there. If you're looking for a simple film that is fun and will likely put a smile on your face, look no further than Wonka. I would gladly watch Chalamet in a sequel to this.","

",jimparis-03634,11-Feb-24,"This was the musical that needed to follow Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The version with Johnny Depp did not fill that gap, it was a different story. I will enjoy watching this over and over. We seem to have a problem with those who do not like to see a happy story. That is truly a shame, as this is fantastic. People, go see this any way you can, it is worth it in any form. I really wish I had seen it in the theater, it would be worth it and more. I am beginning to see that Timothee Chalatmet is an actor par excellence. I am more interested in his future movies than I was before. Young man, you have a great future ahead of you.","

Wonka," Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure Capitalisation
",TomTalksFilms,19-Dec-23,"Out of all of Roald Dahls books, Charlie and the chocolate factory has to be the one that needed another big screen adaptation the least. After 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you may of been of the thinking like myself that this story has had enough big screen adaptations. That is however apparently not the case according to Warner Bros and here we have a third adaptation of that very same story, 2023's Wonka.Directed by Paddingtons Paul King and staring Timothee Chalamaladingdong as Willy himself. The story is prequel to the original 1971 film and follows Wonka as he tries to bring his chocolate to the masses. He is however not alone in this pursuit and the chocolate cartel that already reside in the centre of the city want Wonka gone. Firstly, I remember very little about the '71 film as it failed to have much of an impact on me as a child. I did however grow up with the 2005 film which whilst far from perfect I enjoy despite this perhaps being an unpopular opinion. Being that I'm now into my 20's I can't say I was that exited for another Willy Wonka film however I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised.The thing that perhaps surprised me the most was that the film commits to being a musical. Whilst the other two films certainly have songs, I wouldn't say they were musicals per se however this one certainly is. I didn't feel the trailer made that clear but perhaps that was intentional as musicals of late do tend to do poorly at the box office. The songs themselves whilst not anything I'm going to be listening to over and over again were enjoyable and worked well with the films premise. A premise based on a man who is selling more than chocolate he's selling dreams and doing so against a cartel who are simply selling chocolate at extortionate prices (Cadbury I'm looking at you) to make their wallets fatter. The music only added to the magic and the sense of wonderment that the film provides. Every character in this film is very cartoonish and the films target audience is clearly younger children however I think adults will still find things to enjoy here too. I did at times think the main villains the chocolate cartel were a bit overly silly to the point where they are no longer menacing however this didn't impact my enjoyment of the film overall.Compared to the 2005 film it's a very positive take with an optimistic Wonka who has nothing but the upmost trust in people which could at times be mistaken for naivety. Generally I'm not a happy go lucky person and I do still prefer the bleakness of the 2005 film however I can't deny I left this film with a beaming smile and despite it not being directly a Christmas film it does have a Christmassy feel to it.","

Wonka," ""The greedy beat the Needy""
",daisukereds,22-Jan-24,"Truthfully, this was much better than I expected.Not because of the simplistic script, the known Hollywood-people in roles other lesser-known actors could have partaken in (like Keegan-Michael Key's role! Although the rest of Wonka's posse was a breath of fresh air), the tacked-on franchise that didn't really need a sequel and such. But because the pacing is good, there's an emotional core that works very well and has a good resolution, and because as a musical it delivers catchy and energetic songs that all properly match the tone of what is being conveyed! I do think it is a bit too Paddington-adjacent (but if you are good at something) and somewhat derivative and quite different to actual-Wonka expectations.. but more is always better than none, specially when it is as competent as it is.And so, now that the movie is on streaming, it's not hard to at least suggest it.","

",joseph_smyth,19-Dec-23,"Let's start by saying it's a good movie. Certainly watch it. Actors and storyline are pretty solid and as for young wonka yeah not bad.Issues with the film are two fold. One I think there are too many songs. There was song every 10 mins or so. Simply too many. They were generally ok with some actually good but with so many the good are lost amongst the noise.Secondly and I think this is a director issue really the film lacks that real lasting impact later that comes from moments. It dosnt structure some of the scenes with enough emotion or platform the moment enough to let the very good actors (aside from the little girl who wasn't great, sorry) shine and take the audience to a height which leaves a last mark. Like when Wilder opens the doors to the chocolate room or tells Charlie that he's won from the original. I think that's down to director/producers to create the moment. The actors certainly looked capable.All that said the movie is still good and has a couple of elected moments. Grant is excellent (as he tends to be these days having found a comfort level in just being himself) and the best song in the movie remains imagination and a good rendition of it towards the end of the movie.","

Wonka," Deliciously Delightful
",JoshuaMercott,23-Jan-24,"Taking the iconic chocolate-making genius Willy Wonka and giving him a modern coat, the 2023 ""Wonka"" movie did right by the character and his legacy.After Johnny Depp's take on him in the 2005 movie and the original 1971 masterpiece with Gene Wilder, it was surprising and satisfying to see Timothée Chalamet give a stellar performance that was quite in keeping with Willy Wonka. He was empathic, innocent, and eccentric, lending ""Wonka"" an inspired humanity, emphasising a person's tendency to dream.This story goes back to when Willy was a young lad seeking an opportunity to open his first shop in the big city. In this regard, he felt like the thousands of young people today dreaming of opening their own startups.Poor but talented, Wonka went on to impress the masses, including the corrupt capitalist chocolatiers who wanted him either out of their business territory or under their control.There was much worth appreciating about how well the team conveyed this message, especially making it easy for young minds to understand. They, after all, deserve to know just how many doors the world intentionally closes.Driven by passion and ambition, and armed with countless chocolate and candy recipes and ideas - of the metaphysical and magical nature - an aspiring Willy Wonka came alive on the screen yet again.All the musical numbers were delightful. I was a tad nervous they'd be corny or cringey, but they did right by the song-n-dance legacy this particular IP is renowned for. Some portions can even make some people cry.A wealth of characters further enriched 2023 ""Wonka"". Aside from all the skilled dancers and choreographers, special shout-out to Hugh Grant (as Oompa Loompa), Sally Hawkins (as Willy's mom), Calah Lane (as Noodle), Natasha Rothwell (as Piper Benz), Rakhee Thakrar (as Lottie Bell), Rich Fulcher (as Larry Chucklesworth), Kobna Holdbrook-Smith (as Officer Affable), and Jim Carter (as Abacus Crunch).The seven villains at the heart of this plot also did noteworthy work. They were caricatures, but interesting regardless. Paterson Joseph (as Slugworth), Matt Lucas (as Prodnose), Mathew Baynton (as Fickelgruber), Keegan-Michael Key (as the police chief), Rowan Atkinson (as Father Julius), Tom Davis (as Bleacher), and Olivia Colman (as Mrs. Scrubitt) were a treat to watch; pun intended.On a side-note, I personally did not feel Hugh Grant was a bad casting choice for the Oompa Loompa, who is as iconic a character as Wonka himself. If you've seen Grant's best movies, you'll realize that he's capable of doing outstanding work.As a British-styled Oompa Loompa, he brought something amusing and fresh to the role, in alignment with his distinguished vocal delivery. Show-business often taps into intricate illusions, so one does not necessarily have to be short-statured to play a person of short stature.The emotional message at the heart of ""Wonka"" was that a genius can come from anywhere and that everyone - no matter if they're rich or poor, man or woman, young or old - deserves a chance at showcasing their talents.Eye-candy visuals and chocolatey-smooth timing defined various scenes and sequences. ""Wonka"" thus contained a captivating gloss of wonder with musical flourishes and subtextual finishes.It was another amazing chapter in the remakes based on this epic character whose cunningly hidden symbolism is matched only by his quirky grace.","

Wonka," Oompa loompa doompety DUMB ... but with bits of beauty
",Vic_max,16-Dec-23,"This movie had a number of beautiful callouts to the original movie with Gene Wilder - like the wondrous melodic tunes and the colorful ""land of chocolate"" imagery. I absolutely LOVED those things about this movie.However - the movie portrays Willy Wonka as some kind of wizard, capable of doing actual magic ... not magician-type tricks, but actual conjuring of virtually any kind of physical objects or landscapes .... albeit chocolate related. This is what confused the heck out of me.He's not supposed to have magical powers. He's supposed to be an eccentric, highly imaginative, and innovative chocolatier..Neither the book nor the two previous movies with Wilder and Depp portray Wonka this way. Even in this movie, he's just supposed to be a magician ... but then does continuous magical conjuring throughout the movie.I know ... the movie is a fictional fantasy and there's a lot of creative license allowed - esp. In kids movies. But I've never seen it this grossly overstated. If they wanted to go in this direction, fine - make clear at the beginning that he's a magical being.Anyway - I did emotionally enjoy the striking visuals, the references to the music of the original, Wonka's determined optimist attitude ... and, of course, every scene with Hugh Grant. However my brain rejected the storyline for the reason I mentioned.If you're fan of the books or.any of the previous movies - you're going to feel the need to check this out. Hopefully, you'll be more open to the storyline.","

Wonka," Cloying, Overproduced, and Bland
",filmguyci-22804,16-Dec-23,"I was born in the late 60s and saw Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory countless times as a child. The reason that film developed cult status was the off kilter performance by Gene Wilder. You never quite knew what to make of Wonka. The story of people trying to find a golden ticket was involving. The reveal of the Chocolate Factory was magical. And I can't think of a better hero to root for than Charlie Bucket.It was an interesting idea to do a Wonka prequel but the change in tone from the original is disappointing and disconnected. Here, Timothee Chalamet's Wonka plays like a male Mary Poppins. Likeable, seemingly magical, but overall lacking the edge that the character needs. Proof that the G rating no longer exists, it's a head scratcher that this is rated PG because I can't think of a more family friendly film than this.Timothee Chalamet is likable and sings well but is overall bland. Hugh Grant provided some amusing moments as the sole Oompa Loompa but hardly enough to create any laughter. My audience was dead silent.The CGI doesn't enhance the film in any way. I longed for the day when a real set was created for a film.The songs were fine but nothing reaches the heights of ""Pure Imagination"" which thankfully was reprised in this film.I hate to be a Scrooge but this film was a big misfire for me. It will most likely only be enjoyed by children who didn't grow up with the original.","

I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining and magical cinematic journey.","

Wonka," A bit of a wonky Wonka
",Boristhemoggy,07-Feb-24,"With dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor Willy Wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.Remember this is an origin movie, exploring Wonka's young life, and not remaking the original film. This review could be long, so if you just want a nutshell review, here we go:
Is it fun? At times, yes.Will I enjoy it? If you concentrate on the bits you like, yes.Is it worth the price of a cinema ticket? No.Will it get an Oscar? Absolutely not.Now, Wonka has been given a great cast. It's obviously benefitted from a huge budget. ($125,000,000) The CGI is very good, but not quite faultless. The story is great, and definitely worthy of a decent film telling.However...
Timothy Chalamet looks the part, but at his young age he simply does not have the ability to act with his voice and his face and body, as well as a seasoned actor. Also his singing is excruciatingly ordinary, and the songs were not even close to films such as The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins. I can't even remember a single song and the film has only finished 3 hours ago. He was pretty flat, carrying out every scene in the same way without ever showing anything but that smile. It really felt like he was just along for the ride and not invested in the story. He clearly failed to understand the character of Wonka properly and that showed in his performance. I think he was badly cast, he's not yet ready for a role like this. Or, maybe he was just poorly directed?If you are going to make a musical you must make the songs tuneful, and memorable. Not one song in Wonka is either of those things, and because Chalamet's singing isn't great, it fails as a musical.I dislike Olivia Colman, but it is fair to say her performance was one of the best in the film. She magically brought the character of Mrs Scrubitt to life and was one of the standout performances of the film. Pure acting talent, nothing more to be said.I've never heard of Paterson Joseph but as Slugworth he struck a brilliant balance between bad guy, and almost-comic book character. I could easily become a fan of his. He wasn't given the easiest part of the three chocolatiers, but his performance was very decent unlike the other two who I honestly felt presenetd as out of their depth amateurs.Keegan-Michael Kay was another decent performance as the Chief of Police. He nailed the part of bumbling fool, but without being completely silly and slapstick childish.I felt an affinity for the characters indebted by Mrs Scrubitt, mostly because of their predicament. But had we not been told they were indebted I would not have guessed as they seemed to be happy and lived cleanly and were well fed. None of that indebtedness really rang true but the characters were played well anyway.The rest of the cast slipped between average and really poor, and I have no idea if that's down to acting ability or direction. I suspect the former as Colman was so great in her part. Sally Hawkins shone in her tiny role, and I wonder why such a fabulous actress was given such a teeny part? It really doesn't make sense.The script was odd. I found odd sayings such as ""everyone being on the same page"" slipped into the dialogue and that really timestamps a film. There were a cluster of dialogue faux pas' such as that and I felt they had been put in there to satisfy people who like that nonsense kind of talk. Overall the script wasn't bad, but it failed to light up situations and people. There was nothing at all that I felt moved me or touched me, and I took nothing memorable from it.It's made about $570,000,000 which isn't a huge amount for a film like that about a much beloved story. I suspect many who remember Gene Wilder bringing Wonka to life were expecting something almost as good as that film. But while people new to Wonka might enjoy it on some level, and I very much expect many to do that, it falls flat as part of the Wonka World.Overall I don't think it's a bad watch, especially if you're not familiar with Willy Wonka, or if you are a Chalamet fan, but I am glad I dind't pay for a cinema ticket, and I won't be watching it again.","

Wonka," Loved it
",evelienkayaert,04-Feb-24,"I loved this movie. Great story, great acting, beautifully made. It felt like a breath of fresh air, a movie that just wants you to have a good time without overthinking, without to much elaborate action scenes. This was a movie where I didnt check my watch to see how long to go but rather how long to enjoy.Top cast with a few fun surprises along the way: Hugh Grant but also Rowan Atkinson!If I have a point of criticism it would be that this Wonka is a more aimiable and less wacko character than Roald Dahls Wonka in the books. But on the other hand: who cares?Just go see it, with or without (your) children :-).","

Wonka," 5 might be harsh but 6 is too high
",patbornotb,25-Jan-24,"I was so looking forward to a fun experience and having see the trailer it made such high promises. But did I laugh once, no, was I entertained, not really. The songs are simply terrible, the script is poor and although the acting is OK nothing really was wow!The only real bit of light, and that was dim, was Hugh Grant who had the best role, but his character as the Oompa Loompa never made eye contact with Wonka when he was talking to him, maybe because it was all done in CGI and he did not know where to look?At best it's eye candy and Timothée Chalamet is the new heartthrob and was excellent in Dune, but I don't know what age group this moving is aimed at?So I'll give it a 5 but it is more a 5.5 and I rate 6 as watchable and OK but this just missed even that mark :(","

Wonka," The Origin of the Chocolate Maker
",TheMysteriousReviewer,05-Feb-24,"I never thought we would get a prequel that involves Willy Wonka, but this was made pretty well. Wonka is a very solid movie that tells a good tale of how the chocolate maker himself began his chocolate business. It was able to provide a solid plot of Wonka's origin, creative visuals that stands out from the original, enjoyable characters that serve well of Willy's journey, and a track of fantastic songs. The movie may feel some of the writing would rely onto the laundry shop element than it would for how Willy started his factory, but other than that, it was definitely worth the tale. Would you like to see how Willy Wonka started his chocolate business? This is worth checking out. Even though it's not as special as the original film, this movie is worth doing its own business","

",samantha210406,15-Dec-23,"I wen't to the theatre without any expections of the movie - only having seen the trailer once and being a bit of a fan of Timothy's acting (Little Women) - and I was plesantly surprised. Especially by the originality of it all.Very good directing and smart screenwriting.You can tell that the actors had a blast while filming this little chocolatey gem and also a lot of freedom for impro. That was not a good, but a GREAT choice if you ask me. Too many remakes today are so to tell 'forced copies' of the once so celebrated original movie. Just a handful is perhaps better than the original. This movies accomplished to succeed at that.Also, big plus one for the humour in some scenes! (:","

Wonka," Too sugary for my taste
",spanking_machine,10-Dec-23,"There's a lot of things to say about this film, I guess we could call a prequel to the original Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory from 1971. Sometimes filmmakers make amazing prequels -Cruella (2021), comes to mind- other times not so much.The story takes us to the very beginning of the Chocolate Factory and the adventures and misadventures a young Willy Wonka had to face on his way of making his dream into reality.There's all sorts of new things happening in this movie. For instance we learn about how Willy Wonka and his first Oompa Loompa met and what had to happen for them to start working together -which added some color to the story, both figuratively and literally speaking-. Another thing, which some die-hard fans of the original film were not happy about, is that they turned Wonka into this joyful and agreeable creature - a gentle magician that pulls things out of his top hat ala Mary Poppins, if you will- someone that doesn't have a mad and scary side, totally unlike the previous interpretations of this peculiar character. So if you're one of those people that loved those unrestrained and darker scenes that we have seen in the previous films (yes I'm referring to the famous boat/tunnel of terror scene) well let's just say this might not be your cup of hot chocolate.Also let's not forget this movie is a musical, therefore expect to hear songs. Now whether the songs are as good as the original 1971 film, or whether they are any good for that matter, that too is open for debate.So all in all, I can understand why fans of the 1971 classic would be annoyed about some aspects of this movie, but let's be honest, the bar was high to begin with, however the question remains, is it not a good film? I kinda wish the first half of it was not as slow, the second half sort of makes up for it with some exciting thrills and action.In the end, I guess only time will tell whether this movie will stand the test of time or fade into obscurity like so many recent remakes, prequels and sequels * cough Mary Poppins Returns cough *.","

Wonka," Not my film
",akoaytao1234,09-Feb-24,"This is awful. Its a kind of slop you put out and forgot afterwards BUT I felt this is more offensively bland than usual.Timothy does ok work in this. Definitely the initial previews did not do him justice BUT this by no means a triumph at all. He plays the Wonka here earnestly. The kind of performance in Musical tend to put to their in-offensive and charming 2nd lead. The other performers were fine too. Its a bit too adjust too to be honest. No one from the other leads were really that noteworthy maybe than Olivia Coleman who did a fine performance.I have big issue with the direction of this one. I think it does not do justice for its performance aspect by cutting off the performers from their torso or cutting immaculately in the worst angles. It just so small to look at. Especially the biggest charm of musical is how it use space and movement (ie claustrophobia or emptiness tied with the rigidness in Cabaret or the expanse and movement of the 50s musicals). It such a choice for this one. Also, the singing here is so awful.Not my film.","

Wonka," A Superfluous Romp that is Pretty Good at Being That
",pinklightswitch,20-Dec-23,"As the worlds number one Willbert Wonkert fan it's a completely unnecessary but on its own solid movie. The directing didn't try to replicate the feeling of either previous Wonka films which is good, it reminded me of the Danny Devito Matilda movie in some places which is funny because Matilda was also created by Roald Dahl. The editing was actually really good, there are a lot of nice touches like sound effects and music syncing to cuts, which is a good segway into the music. The music was quite good, which is good for a musical, there were a couple of songs that I was a little iffy on but it had a lot of energy. The acting was also pretty good, everyone seems to be having a fun time especially the antagonists, but Timothy Chalemet did a decent job. There were a couple times where it felt like he was trying to replicate either one of the previous Wonka actors but when he isn't doing that he's doing a good job, it's definitely not the Wonka I know but it's supposed to be a younger version and I think they did a good job with that. Overall, a pretty good movie, however I feel like as a Roald Dahl enjoyer in the face of the excellent adaptation of certain stories from the book Henry Sugar directed by Wes Anderson also coming out this year, works that I think managed to capture what I loved about Roald Dahls writing and truly elevate it Wonka just doesn't cut it. Especially with the original 1973 movie also elevating the book in my opinion, it is good in terms of being entertaining and being technically good but I don't think it really felt like it either justified its existence, or really provided me what I would want for what is ostensibly an adaptation.","

Wonka," Disappointed
",helenegulla,10-Dec-23,"Charlie and the chocolate factory is my all time favourite movie (2005 version). I watch it 2 times every year; on christmas eve and during the easter Holiday. To be honest i was counting down the days until this premiere since they announced it, which was nearly a year!I was expecting it to be a little similar to the originals and that it would have SOMETHING to do with christmas, however it didnt. I felt like I was watching Oliver Twist, not willy wonka. What disappointed me the most was the storyline. We get to know some of Wonkas childhood in Charlie and the chocolate factory, for instance that he grew up with a prestigious dentist father (dr.wonka) who refused him chocolate/candy and he was sent away for chosing candy over his father at the age of 11. In this movie the story is completely different, showing us a loving (poor) mother who makes him chocolate from scratch on their houseboat. He persues chocolate in the hopes of seeing her again. This doesnt fit what we already know, and I prefer the original version. It would be much better if they went with this in my opinion. I always assumed that he wanted to prove his father wrong, that was his motivation to success. The end of Charlie and the chocolate factory where he made his father proud was moving.Also, the discovery of the tonka beans and their magic is a big part of Charlie and the chocolate factory. The «little man with green hair and orange skin» doesnt look like an Oompa-Loompa at all. He also talks english, not their language (which was fun). And the version of him going there and just finding 4 of their beans is BORING compared to how it was originally. He basically just saw them right away, took them and left. It is a lovely movie, but there is a lot of signing (the songs arent even that great) and some scenes just doesnt make any sense. The scene where they milk the giraffe and start signing is cringy. I barely managed to watch it finish. All in all a fairly good movie, but nothing compared to Charlie and the chocolate factory. I love that movie and all the Harry Potter movies (same creators), but this is just average. Sorry. It felt rushed and just did not fill my expectations. Hopefully someone else chares my opinion and makes a even better version in the future.","

But that's it.It's a pitty as the movie had all the ingredients to be an above average movie. But the story is dull, the other characters aside wonka and the Oompa loompa are really plain. And neither of the songs or the scenes are near to memorable. (Excluding the songs from the original movie)Compared to the two previous adaptations where I can still sing some of the songs from the top of my mind and remember the scenes and most of the characters, I can't remember any of the original songs of this movie just after whatching it, and I'm sure I will be forgetting the rest...I'm aware this is due to having high expectations, so without any context, the movie is a good one.7/10.","

Wonka," Lacks the dark undertones but delivers a fun musical
",MovieWarfare,03-Feb-24,"This prequel lacks a lot of the dark undertones of previous live-action Willy Wonka movies. Timothée portrays Wonka with this upbeat, charming and charismatic nature that lacks any dark edge to him compared to Gene Wilder. It doesn't help that the story doesn't explore more of who Wonka is, so it kind of wastes the prequel idea.However, it is a fun, light-hearted musical that delivers on a whimsical adventure that everyone can enjoy. Vibrant costumes, well-made set design, enjoyable musical numbers and great performances with superb direction from the director, who is known for the Paddington movies, execute a film that is a very enjoyable time.","

Wonka," Inspired By The 1971 Classic But Very Much It's Own Film
",gpeevers,08-Feb-24,"Found this film to be a very strong prequel to the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I thought Timothée Chalamet did a wonderful job with a performance that was inspired by Gene Wilder's but was still all his own. The film also features some wonderful supporting performances including Rowan Atkinson's corrupt priest, a pair of recent Oscar winners (Sally Hawkins and Olivia Coleman) and a wonderfully nasty trio of rival chocolatiers. Another standout was Hugh Grant as a lone Oompa whose look is much inspired by the 1971 film but digitally reduced and coupled with a great performance and inspired dialog.It should be pointed out that this film is more of a musical than its forbearer which featured a few songs. I liked the songs and felt they all worked though I wouldn't label it myself as a great musical.As someone who truly enjoyed the Gene Wilder film - I really liked the musical and visual cues they included here.","

It is very different from the previous two movies, and it is refreshing but still feels nostalgic.

I normally do not like musicals so I had no expectations of liking this movie, other than my general enjoyment of the original. This movie is shockingly funny, beautiful, and most importantly entertaining. Plus the editing was fantastic, every transition and shot felt smooth as butter and just had a sparkling energy to it. They did a great job of using visuals to capture that child-like feeling of imagination and wonderment. More than anything I think this movie has a lot of charm. The main cast is very likable and easy to route for, but even the ""bad guys"" made a lasting impact and I always looked forward to seeing them in scenes. Wonka doesn't push any boundaries for plot or dialogue, but it's a movie I'll be sure to see again and I definitely recommend you find the time to see in theaters!","

There's no way to sugar coat it, it's a musical. There are so many different ways they could have gone as a prequel. There's none of the mysterious and slightly dark scenes like the original. I feel like the Wonka in the new one doesn't represent the original Wonka. I may be hung up on the endless singing, but this version is the epitome of what is being pushed out lately. Don't go to this movie expecting anything that is like or even aligns with the original Wonka. Disappointing.","

I kinda like the scrub scrub song, but I was kinda surprised to find out Timothée Chalamet's singing capability. He can sing pretty well. Hugh Grant sang the Oompa Loompa song splendidly. He looked rather silly as an Oompa Loompa in my opinion, but he still performed very well. The antagonists were pretty despicable, which means the actors have done a great job. The drama was also very touching. This is an amazing musical to watch with your family. Don't miss it!","

Wonka," Exceeded my expectations.
",nicholastsichlis,27-Dec-23,"Wonka is a prequel that tells the story of how Willy Wonka beat the chocolate cartel with the help of an orphan girl and an Oompa Loompa, and made his dreams come true of being the best chocolate maker in the world, building his chocolate factory. I can see Paul King making a second film, where they adapt the classic story once again.First thing I want to touch on is Paul King as the director. He is famous for directing the Paddington films, which were amazing. This movie has a similar vibe, and I have to say the direction here was excellent. Same with the pacing, you never get bored, the film never loses its footing.Timothee Chalamet had no right being this good of a Wonka. He had the charisma and whimsical nature of Gene Wilder, while also lending some weirdness from Johnny Depp. But at the end of the day, this is a completely different universe they're building here, with a completely different Wonka. Sometimes Chalamet was a bit too much of a silly Willy for my taste, but you quickly forget about that.Chalamet is not the only great actor in this film, because the whole cast was absolutely perfect. Olivia Coleman best suited this slimy role, Rowan Atkinson (whom I wanted a bit more of) had the whole theater laughing, Keegan Michael-key was funnier than ever in this role, and last but certainly not least, Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa was a very strange choice to say the least, but I loved him. Heard he didn't though.The biggest thing everyone's talking about, is the fact that Wonka is a musical. I have no idea why they didn't advertise this at all, maybe because they thought less people would go see it, but then again, the original 1971 film had a ton of singing in it too. Anyway, the songs were all fantastic and catchy, Timmy needs to improve on his dancing skills but overall I loved every song. ""Come with me, and you'll be, in a world of pure imagination"" hit.Run to the cinema to watch this movie, it's the perfect film for the holidays, the kids will eat this up.","

Wonka," An enjoyable origin film
",nscoby93,16-Feb-24,"Though I've never really been a fan of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory or of Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Wonka, I surprisingly found rather enjoyable.Wonka is a fun, sweet film for the whole family. It has laughs, songs, and heart that I'm sure will entertain.But while I did enjoy the film, not everything worked for me. The music, for the most part, was good, and the comedy did land, garnering plenty of laughs. I, however, think there were some musical numbers that weren't completely necessary. Making some scenes feel stretched out.I also don't remember at all during this films marketing, was it ever presented as a musical. If I hadn't already known it was a musical beforehand, I probably would have been annoyed as I am not very fond of musicals. However, the musical parts surprisingly didn't turn me off as most musicals would because they had appropriate timing on when to stop singing and revert to traditional dialogue. Nothing annoys me more with musicals than when dialogue is sung, I find it completely ridiculous. Singing a song is one thing, but don't sing dialogue.The story, writing, and performances were all good, including musical performances. The cgi was solid enough with some sequences looking better than others.Finally, Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka and Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa. When I first saw them in the trailers, I was skeptical, but they both gave wonderful performances in their respected roles. I still would not put Timothee above Gene Wilder as I don't think anyone in their right mind would. Just to say, in this films rendition of Wonka Timothee fit in very well.Overall I enjoyed this film and it was entertaining but it still doesn't touch the classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and while I may not be a fan I can recognize a classic when I see one.IMDb: 6/10

Wonka," Looks beautiful but the story is lacking
",arod_85,17-Dec-23,"I'll start with the positive points. This film is gorgeous. I preferred the look and atmosphere to the Alice and Wonderland-ish feel of the factory from the 2005 version. Next, Timothee makes a great young Wonka. The other actors are pretty good as well and I was really impressed with the girl that played Noodle. Her acting was great, especially because she is far younger than I thought she was. Now for the aspects I found lacking. There was far too much singing. I would have preferred they omitted all the singing or at least cut down some of the songs. Timothee is a pretty mediocre singer, which is okay, he made hp for it with his acting, but that was more of a reason not to have them break into song every 10 minutes. Most of the songs weren't really all that catchy and it would have been fine with maybe the one from the original movie. The biggest issue with this movie was the story. It was so basic and reminded me of the cheesy storylines from movies from my childhood like ""Ritchie Rich"". I think I would have rather preferred a remake as opposed to a prequel. This was an origin story of sorts, but there really wasn't anything unique about Wonka's backstory that made the viewer understand how he became who he was. Though I thought Noodle was great, I wouldn't have bothered with a hole new storyline that didn't appear to have much impact on the present day Wonka. If they wanted an origin story, I would have preferred they spent more time diving into how Wonka became an inventor or chocolateer. It would have been fascinating to see other's reaction to him growing up as an eccentric outcast. It would have been great to learn more about how he came across the oompa loompas. Instead, they created a whole new story with a weak villain plot that was basic and contained nothing original or even fun. The film also made horrible use of the oompa loompas which was disappointing because they are essential to the Chocolate Factory story. In conclusion, this was okay. I did prefer it to the 2005 version. I didn't hate it, but I also wouldn't watch it again. Again, Timothee is a great Wonka though!","

Wonka," Great film and the best Oompa Loompa I could ever imagine
",sophia-75443,28-Jan-24,"Wonka is a terrific and exciting movie. I loved the new story so much. Many of you might love Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and don't like Wonka that much, because Johnny Depp is such a different Character.But the new Wonka actor is so much more believable for the role and all the new characters were absolutely amazing.Many people say, that all of High Grant's Oompa Loompa scenes were in the trailer. I don't watch many trailers just because of THIS. So many times the most interesting and twisting part of the story gets put in the trailer and you miss all the fun.Hugh Grant was the best Oompa Loompa I could ever imagine. At first I thought, he can't be an oompa Loompa, but when I saw his scenes in the movie...
He was so funny and I laughed every time the Oompa Loompa was around.So I was very surprised that the rating was very normal, since it was such a great experience for me!","

",dbuckshnis,01-Jan-24,"I can't recall the original movie with Gene Wilde so I can't comment on any references to the original show. So as a stand alone movie I thought it was entertaining and fun. I did not realize it was a musical and it was annoying at first but then it became paced better and songs were catchy.Timothy was fabulous as Wonka! Really captivating in his eyes and persona. The storyline was pretty predictable but the ensemble carried it well with both Jordan and Hugh stealing the show. Hugh was hilarious as an oompah loopa and his deadpan pace made him even more deceitful. Peele with his constant weight gain was funny too, especially next to Mr. Bean.Sets were great as was costuming. For $8 - it was worth the $$.","

Wonka," As a Wonka fan I was impressed.
",jae-32559,16-Dec-23,The original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. The Johnny Depp version wasn't my favorite. But Wonka was so incredibly sweet and enchanting. The trio of chocolate shop owner villains were classic child movie villains. The inn keepers were also a great highlight. But neither over shadowed Wonka and Noodle who were fantastic. I'm a 43 year old man and I left the theater smiling. It's a feel good movie that brings out the inner child. It's nice to escape for a couple hours from a world that seems very broken. Leave your adulting at the door and just have a good time.,"

Wonka," Fun and cute; good not great
",NS-movie-reviews,02-Jan-24,"The vibrance of ""Wonka"" is its best asset, along with a lead actor who does a great job with the task at hand. The whacky zaniness of the movie walks a fine line between wholesome and heartwarming to slightly ludicrous. A perfectly fine place for a good, but not great, movie to live.I wasn't expecting the plot to be quite so detached from reality. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief, which is understandable given the character and the world you're walking into. But sometimes the heart of the story itself lost its footing. The underlying logic of the tale being told, even if whimsical and fantastical, should be grounded in *something.*As the title says, it was cute and it was fun. It could've been better, but it was an entertaining movie.","

",rallymotor,29-Dec-23,"Watched this last night and the movie was way above my expectations. I did not know that it had that many musical scenes in the script. Most of the music was fantastic, so if you really like musical movies then this is a no-brainer. The story is mostly cheerful and uplifting, so I really enjoyed it. I was not certain what to expect going into this, but it had fantasy and some comedy, both are flavors I like in a movie. It's a heart warming story in general and all the actors are pretty good.Nothing terribly negative about this movie. I think they could have made more about the security guard lady, sounded like she could have had more to expand in the movie. I did not like one of the obstacles the characters had to face ""in the chocolate"", not to give anything away. Just not my style of obstacle, kind of gross, but again there is not a whole lot to complain about for this movie. Lighthearted, warm hearted, grab your bag of popcorn and enjoy this movie with your kids.","

Wonka," A charming and lighter reimagining of Willy Wonka for the 2023 family
",ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,31-Dec-23,"Wonka is solidly entertaining as a reimagined origin story for Willy Wonka from Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Timothée Chalamet is charming and sympathetic in this lighter sanitized interpretation of Wonka, singing and dancing in glitzy musical numbers in a story that details his beginnings and eventually built his famous chocolate factory.Director Paul King keeps things light and moving along swiftly. The musical numbers are well choreographed and upbeat and there are good laughs. Hugh Grant hilariously steals every scene as the Oompa Loompa.All that said, this is not the Willy Wonka character as I'm familiar with. Willy Wonka's darker nastier side, the part of him that's okay with the five spoiled kids getting hurt (or dying) for messing around in his factory and cracks cannibalism jokes, is fundamentally missing.That said, I don't think I'd want to watch Timothée Chalamet, with his delicate and sensitive demeanour, playing that darker side, in this 2023 vision of the story would break people's hearts-Adam Driver just popped into mind. I suspect 2023 parents now probably would keep the 1971 Gene Wilder film away from their kids and would have stuck to reading Roald Dahl's book...until now.This quibble aside, Wonka does competently fit itself properly in our current sensitive times as solid family entertainment. In fact, it is a cut above all the message-heavy Disney films this year.I recommend it for the whole family.","

Wonka," Worthy Addition to Willy Wonka Story
",herrcarter-92161,08-Jan-24,"I'm always wary when Hollywood tries to do a sequel, prequel or remake of a classic movie. It almost always ends up comparing unfavorably to the old movie that everyone loved. The horrible ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", with Johnny Depp as Mr. Wonka is a prime example. So, I must say that I was skeptical, and then pleasantly surprised once I saw ""Wonka"". It was very entertaining. It's definitely a product of the 2020's, but one that managed to keep most of the spirit of the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" from the 70's.""Wonka"" managed to maintain the whimsical, fantastic and somewhat dark tone that we expect from Roald Dahl stories. You had the fun, naive, always upbeat hero, our young Willy Wonka, played to perfection by Timothée Chalamet. You had his very likable friends, especially the young orphan girl Noodle, played equally well by Calah Lane. You had the campy, cartoonish villains, such as evil chocolatiers Slugworth and his compatriots, sweatshop owner Mrs. Scrubbit and the corrupt chocoholic priest. You even had Hugh Grant, lending his dry, British wit to the character of an Oompa Loompa. And, of course, you had the over-the-top sets, scenery and costumes. All of it combined to carry you away into a delightful fantasy world, where you eagerly suspended disbelief and let the outrageous story suck you in.Was it a perfect movie? No. But it came close. I did find the relationship between Willy Wonka and Noodle a bit cringy at times. They're supposed to be just friends, which is the appropriate relationship for a young girl and a grown man, but a times they seem to imply some kind of romance between the two. It just felt yucky. Also, the songs in the movie were pretty blasé and forgettable. If you're going to do a big, expensive production and you feel like you have to add songs to it, at least spend a few extra bucks to get some decent songs.Otherwise, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I appreciated the fact that it was a clean film, with no questionable content that would have made me regret taking my kids to see it. I also appreciated that there was no attempt to get political or preachy. On the whole, this was a charming, likable and engaging movie from start to finish.","

Two very touching tear jerking/happy moments, that even our 10y/o old son got emotional. Very touching, in a meaningful way...

Wonka," Fun, a musical I actually enjoyed. More Mary Poppins than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
",whitestar_man,05-Jan-24,"I was dubious, did we really need a reimagined Wonka in the form of a prequel, as a musical with Hugh Grant as an Ompalumpah? On paper I would have said hell no. But damn it if this isn't just some silly fun for all, something Hollywood has long forgotten as it churns out mediocre comic book movies.Yes it's silly, makes no sense and has the barest connection to Willy Wonka and Roald Dahl, but who cares its so much fun. And I hate musicals to boot.I won't bother with the story as it's pretty threadbare but sufficient to keep it going. It's the colour, the magic and suspension of belief that just work. The characters are very cartoonish and the baddies in particular do fit the Roald Dahl world, it's very British seaside comedy/vaudeville in character.Timothee Chalamet is perfectly cast as Wonka for this incarnation, his childish charm is perfect as a very nieve version of Wonka (which might upset purists), for whom nothing can get him down.Hugh Grant is brilliantly cast at the Umpaloopah and thankfully not over used.The young Calah Lane as the young but world weary noodle does a good job without being sickly sweet or annoying and the mottly crew of baddies, including Rohan Atkinson, are perfectly over the top without being annoying.The songs and singing is good, though not top notch.It goes along at a decent pace and doesn't overwear its welcome.It's not perfect and is very much a sugar hit rather than sustained good, but as a fun family fare, it's hard to beat and a rare gem. Just don't take it seriously or compare to previous Wonka's this it's own thing and if anything more in common with old British musicals like Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang than it does to either Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp iterations of Wonka.","

Wonka," Not pure imagination, but good enough
",Blazehgehg,12-Feb-24,"This movie is over-produced, trying too hard to be whimsical, and relies way too much on fuzzy nostalgia for the 1971 movie.And yet... I cannot deny I was charmed by it anyway.I suppose the secret is its portrayal of Wonka himself. The 1971 movie treated Willy Wonka basically as a God. Weird, but untouchable. Infallible. This movie doesn't quite dress him down, but it's not afraid to give him flaws.And, for a movie supposedly about Wonka's ""origins"", it does not get bogged down in explaining the source of his magic or mystery. There's still a bit of mystique about him, even if it does sometimes feel more unearned than not.It's precious about the ""Willy Wonka Lore"" (a weird concept to write down), but it doesn't forget to be itself, either. There's plenty of fun to be had around all the nostalgia and forced whimsy. It got me to laugh out loud more than a few times.Is it a worthy successor to the timeless 1971 classic? That's a tall order. Nearly impossible. And I don't know if this movie does it.But neither does that make this a bad movie. I quite enjoyed it.","

The side characters shined in comparisons.The most memorable part of the movie is the ending and that's only because they redid the songs from the Gene Wilder version as well as an updated visuals of the chocolate factory.Overall the movie is average, it just lacks a spark.

I was doubtful of the casting choice going in and my expectations were unfortunately met. The music was another aspect of this movie i absolutely despised. Every song is a tacky broadway like number that is only playable on mute. As for the visuals, they are on par with what paddington was able to accomplish and were overall very immersive and we'll established. The overall story was also great but was dampened by boring dialogue and jokes that miss the mark. The only real character moments I enjoyed were some scenes with the chocolate cartel members and the relationship between Mrs. Scrubbit and Bleacher.

However, not only did I finish it. I finished it with a smile on my face. It brought back old memories of being a child and hearing those songs again after all these years.

I really wanted to fall in love with it but it felt like it was trying too hard and consistently falling short. I felt like it lacked the magic of the original. I understand this was a prequel and a lot of the magic of the factory hadn't been realized yet but I still wished there was more candy in the movie too.For me, Wonka was extremely witty and clever, and made remarks that are simply unforgettable. This Wonka lacked that presence. Slugworth was very entertaining to watch- witty, animated, sarcastic, and funny. He was probably my favorite character in this version.","

Wonka," Paul King has done it again.
",hfreinoso,24-Jan-24,"Wonka was movie, I was interested in solely because of Paul King. He directed both Paddington movies (1 & 2) and those were films were such beautiful family friendly movies. And because of that I was so looking forward to Wonka. And after watching the movie, once again Paul King delivers with this film. Wonka is the spiritual prequel to the 1971 classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Timothée Chalamet's performance as Willy Wonka is brilliant. Timothée, throughout the film, is able to capture that aurora we all felt watching Gene Wilder play the quirky and fun candy maker. His mannerisms, temperament, humor, wittiness, and enthusiasm is unmatched, cementing himself as the Willy Wonka we know and love in Gene Wilder. As first, many seemed skeptical of how well he would perform, but undoubtedly, Timothe Chalament is simply wonderful. Another charming performance is that of Calah Lane as Noodle, the orphan worker Wonka meets in the film. Her companionship matched with Chalamet's well-natured character, displays such emotion and hope. Lane's character is confused and silenced initially, but through Wonka, she finds herself and then builds the confidence to become wholesome while tagging along with him. And the song ""For a Moment"" in the zoo was phenomenal, I loved that song and it almost made gulp. The music was so beautiful and each song was so catchy and it made the film better in my opinion. This film is a family friendly movie and I got to say I love this version of Wonka. All cast and crew did a spectacular job with this film. They were all memorable with this the villain's and the side characters were just so great. It isn't just with the Paddington movies, no Paul King know how to make TRUE family-friendly movies. 9/10.

Wonka," The definition of Whimsical
",fdbjr,01-Jan-24,"'Wonka' is simply a delight, the definition of whimsical, light as a feather and frothy with innocence. I write mostly to put some context with the 1971 version. That picture was a success, mostly due to a superb performance by Gene Wilder and three unforgettable songs (in otder, 'Candyman', 'I've Got a Golden Ticket' and 'Pure Imagination'.) But it had considerable flaws It began life as a promotion for a new line of candy. It was never properly financed - the scene designers did their best with a completely inadequate budger. Above all, there are several ham-handed, leaden sermons to the kids, about the dangers of tv watching, gum chewing, gluttony, and general selfishness. They're both unpleasant and boring. Oompa-loompa, indeed.The songs in this movie are not nearly so good, but they are all at the service of really wonderful production numbers (there are none in the 1971 movie). The villainy and villains manage to be as delightfully funny as the heroes. The movie is superbly cast, with Timothee Chalamet surprisingly good as Wonka (he is not been in too many movies in which he exhibited lightness-of-touch), and the likes.of Olivia Colma, Hugh Grant, and Keegan-Michael Key perfect in their parts.It's the best family movie in years. Roald Dahl would have disliked this thorughly, which only indicates what a triumph of innocent fun it is.","

Wonka," Joyous and funny
",alicrab,10-Dec-23,"Before I praise Timothee Chalamet's performance - he is an all singing, dancing, actor... the highlights of this joyous and funny movie were Tom Davis' Bleacher and Paterson Joseph's villain. Tom Davis in a lederhosen and a mini silk kimono holding a tiny tea cup and saucer will continue to make me chuckle... brilliant. Paul King and Simon Farnaby's script is perfection for me re the details of the jokes and characters, it just made me smile from ear to ear. The literalness of Matt Lucas's character, the heaving at the word poor by Mathew Baynton... I think this film is definitely for adults... children will like the music and the giraffe but the adults will enjoy the sublime humour. A feel good movie for all. And no it doesn't matter that Wonka is not yet the jaded eccentric Wonka of the Gene Wilder film. Chamalet smashes it out of the park. More from Paul King and Simon Farnaby pls.","

Wonka," Honestly far better than expected.
",jasonmartin-74754,25-Dec-23,"It's hard to watch the latest iteration of Willy Wonka without comparing to the original Willy Wonka from 71 and the subsequent Charlie and the chocolate factory from 2005. The joy from the original is unmatched but this current iteration had plenty of joy to bring. The comparison would be:
Original Willy Wonka> Wonka>>>> Charlie.Now for judging Wonka on its own merits:+:
Story flowed in cohesive reasonable manner.Protagonists were ""likable.""
Antagonists were ""unlikeable.""
All characters were well acted and portrayed their roles very well.-:
Songs weren't catchy and too frequent.Plot itself was wonky but completely forgivable.There's alot to like and enjoy about this movie for both adults and children. My humble opinion is to give it a chance. If you're apprehensive try on a $5 discount Tuesday I had some laughs and thoroughly enjoyed it.","

Wonka," You will be in a world of pure imagination
",chrisgordon75,18-Dec-23,"I did not know what the film would be, but had liked the trailers and went to watch this last night. It was a pure delight. Chalamet's Wonka was wonderful, capturing the essence of Gene Wilder, with sublime performances from all. The villains were ridiculously brilliant and pure Dahl-esque. The songs were catchy, beautiful set design and choreography. There was not a thing I could fault about it at all. I am 48, grew up watching Gene Wilder's version and this took me and my family completely to a wonderful world of pure imagination. As others have said, it is both visual and auditory feast, from start to finish.","

Wonka," Very pleasant and enjoyable
",sjo-15,02-Jan-24,"I really enjoyed this.Timothee Chalamet is a lighter, less scary and much more relatable Wonka than the last one. He has real charisma and is convincing.The supporting cast is a bit like a who's who of UK supporting actors and comedians - its fun to trace to the links back to the Director (via Mighty Boosh and Paddington), Writer (Ghosts) and others.We even get to see Phil Wang dancing!Olivia Coleman is a joy to behold. She plays bad very well and seems to be having a great time.Hugh Grant plays a small version of Hugh Grant as only Hugh Grant can - perfect.It felt a tiny bit long at 2 hours.Great story. Great effects and ideas - though not as magical as its an origins story.A few songs mixed with echoes of old ones.Its a fun family movie.","

Wonka," Timothee! Wow! Superb!
",c-butler-69,18-Dec-23,"I absolutely loved the film Wonka starring Timothee Chalamet! Timothee's performance in the film was truly fantastic and filled with charm. He brought a unique and captivating energy to the role of Wonka, making it hard to take my eyes off the screen. His ability to embody the character and bring him to life was truly remarkable. Throughout the film, Timothee's charm shined through, captivating the audience and making us fall in love with the character of Wonka. His performance was a delightful blend of charisma, wit, and talent. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish, thanks in large part to Timothee's incredible portrayal. I highly recommend watching Wonka for Timothee's exceptional performance alone.","

I'm a Johnny depp fan but honestly I thought this version was better than the one with Johny.What a happy movie.. we need more of this! We need to learn how to be a kid again and enjoy watching movies like these, instead of all those sad, horror, war, depressing stuff they call movies these days.I watched this on the theater and now I'm adding it to my all time favorite list.My friends are all hyped about oppenheimer meanwhile I'm glad I'm watching Wonka.Don't expect a movie that logically makes sense, this is a fantasy genre, if you want logic go for something else.","

The film was fantastic and we didn't want it to end. Timothee was the part for sure and I feel this will make him a household name.it will have the older generation feeling nostalgic for the old (gene wilder) movie (let's pretend the Johnny Depp one doesn't exist) and the young falling in love with the magic of wonka. The entire theatre clapped at the end and to add Hugh Grant as the umperlumpa was absolutely hilarious- stay into the credits for an additional bit of fun - enjoy.,"

Wonka," Moderate fun. Only moderate.
",dweston-38669,22-Jan-24,"The darkness and cynicism is missing from the classic 1971 original, Timothée Chalamet is too weedy and wet in the lead, since this is his story ,and he displays no oddness, weirdness or social insecurity that Gene Wilder famously showed,and the love interest with the character Noodle; is appalling; utterly devoid of chemistry, spark and ,well,love that this should be a textbook to screenwriters in how NOT to build a love interest. So so poor!It lacks the heart,soul of Paul King's previous Paddington films- which I can watch all day.However, it has a colourful, zesty feel, I laughed a lot, the songs have charm and the design of ? London in Victorian era that is an appeal, both Olivia Colman(Katie) and Hugh Grant are having a blast.I wont say that is shouldnt be made but it certainly needed to be better cast and a couple of rewrites.",NA
Wonka," Good; but not great.
",pmqkjpgk,17-Dec-23,"The new Wonka movie presents a visually stunning spectacle, yet falls short in narrative depth. The music, although well-composed, feels out of sync with Wonka's mouth, contributing to the film's superficialaity. The antagonists, while present, miss a sense of genuine malice, leaving one questioning their impact. This lack of depth permeates the movie, challenging its believability despite its fictional roots.References to the original film come across as forced, failing to capture the original's charm. The plot hinges on chance, an element that feels both central and contrived, further distancing the film from a sense of realism. Characters, except for a few, lack realism.Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka, while competent, doesn't fully embrace the eccentricity of Dahl's vision, feeling somewhat restrained. The story's arc, complex and unwieldy, makes it difficult for the audience to fully engage or root for the characters' journey.","

",wackoreviews,26-Dec-23,"Come with meeee and you'll beeee in the wackoooo world of my reviewssss! Being a prequel to ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", this movie follows a young and poor Willy Wonka who is filled with dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate. However, he later discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.First of all, and I really don't know why not much people knew this, this movie is a musical. Let me start with that actually, the movie is filled with so many songs all being so joyful and catchy. Although most of those songs are new, Wonka borrows a couple classics from the original 1971 film.The main storyline was pretty fun to follow, keeping in mind that the movie's target audience is the younger generation. Additionally, the small subplots where not just for filling and were actually quite interesting. The movie was pretty magical but not as much as I expected as the original was filled with surprises and magic. I don't know if I really should be comparing with the original that much but I also noticed they missed some key points that ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" but I think that they did that for the plot. Additionally, Timothe Chalamet's performance was really good especially the choreography and the singing. The rest of the cast was decent too.Score:8/10.","

Wonka," Doesn't feel like it fits
",madgizmo,06-Feb-24,For sure would be nice to see a good new Wonka movie. But this one doesn't seem to be the one. If you get all of them together this one is more a standalone movie. The time lines doe not match between the other movies. The style feels different. Even that it doesn't feel like a reall Wonka doesn't mean it was bad. It had some good humor. And still enjoyable doesn't really like that much of singing In a movie... But that just my taste. The acting was good and the humor was funny. The cast was prefect for the movie. Even though I wish Johnny depp was in it not even as Wonka but another part was even fine to. He always gives a movie a little bit more bite.,"

Wonka," Wonka Review
",dave118118,12-Dec-23,"Wonka - 8.5/10An unashamed family musical that is perfect for this time of year. It took 2 or 3 musical numbers before it grabbed me, but when it did, I found myself comparing it to Aladdin in terms of how catchy the songs were and how much energy it had. Then I realised that I am comparing a classic Disney animation with live action, which is the biggest compliment I can pay this film. Paul King has effortlessly achieved something that is incredibly tough to pull off. It puts every single Disney live action 'remake' to shame.The plot is a little messy, but they deserve credit for not just retreading the same Wonka story we've already seen twice on the big screen. I felt that King and Farnaby were looking at multiple Roald Dahl stories for inspiration. The three members of the chocolate cartel reminded me of the three farmers from Fantastic Mr Fox. The Giraffe bit reminded me of the The Giraffe, The Pelly and Me. Olivia Coleman and Tom Davies grumpy landlords were reminiscent of The Twits etc...Paddington 2 is a tough act to follow, and whilst this is a little uneven and has slight pacing issues, I think you just must let those knit picks fall to the floor and go with it. It's a joyous and hilarious film. Neil Hannon's music is catchy and full of clever word play. Other than a few moments where Wonka's eccentricity is a bit of a stretch, Timothée Chalamet does more than enough to cement his place as the second-best screen Wonka. There's plenty of room for the Wilder cynicism to grow within him, but for now we have a much more wide-eyed and optimistic Wonka and I look forward to seeing where they take him in the inevitable sequels that follow.Can Paul King make Wonka 2 as good as Paddington 2? He's certainly laid the chocolatey foundations.","

Wonka," In fine Tune with the Original
",BornKnight,23-Jan-24,"After so many years I wonder if the majority of people have seen the original (comedy / musical) movie of 71, that is a classic. I myself was a bit worried when I saw the announce for this one (haven't watchet a single trailer).Oh how I was wrong - Timothée Chalamet's Willy Wonka is just perfect on how he emulates the original Wonka by Richard Gere plus the musical and dance scenes aren't bad at all.To those who knew the original movie, this gets the start of life of Wonka as a chocolatier, and fill many gaps on the original story - but not all, one being the personality he achieved later and the later relation with the OOmpa Loompa.The movie is just a delight - every little character have its little part and backstory and the story is a family friendly one with all the magic of the original. Even the secondary characters are good choices and all relates in perfect tune.To those who don't know, the character was original from a book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' a 1964 children's novel by Roald Dahl, that had a sequence (a crazy one btw, in 1972). Many politically incorrect terms were already omitted in the 1971 book.The movie gets outside of those, being more a spiritual prequel film for the 71 one, exploring Willy Wonka's origins in 2023. And remembering the 2005 remake of the original by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.As a complimentary note, the Dahl's family agreed with Netflix to expand the Wonka universe on a series of animations for the streaming channel.The movie gets a 7.7 out of 10.o for be a B+.","

Only thing I can remember seeing him before was Dune and wasn't a big fan, but he won me over here.I went into this having seen not a single preview/trailer, so I fully expected this to be the same familiar story, retold. It was not, and I was pleasantly surprised. Loved that by itself, but I also really enjoyed the story they gave us. Character development is essential and many artists/creators lately forget about that. So this was a nice change of pace.","

Wonka," Full Of Whimsy and Charm!
",ScorpioDog,17-Feb-24,"'Wonka' was so much fun and is perfect watch for families! It perfectly balances the whimsy with musical elements.The musical numbers in this are so catchy! You will be humming so many of the songs long after the credits have ended. They also fit very well into the on-going narrative instead of derailing it. Timothée Chalamet did a great job playing the beloved main character. Quite a few of the film's villainous characters worked as well. In particular, the chocolate cartel and chief of police characters had some fun chemistry!While being a visually eye-catching film, the cinematography and editing could have been a little more adventurous. Additionally, I do think the Oompa-Loompa sequences should have been reworked. It seemed a little tacked on in order to have some more brand recognition instead of being a key part to the story. Overall though, this is a great family film!","

Wonka," Pure magic fantasy illusion and chocolate
",glori1491,07-Jan-24,"For me, the film that I have enjoyed the most of 2023, one of the best of this year, this is how the celebration of Disney's 100 years had to be. This film, which is an original prequel to the Cholate Factory, tells us about the beginnings of Willy Wonka, a half-wizard cholatero who in his childhood and youth always had a lot of magic, fantasy and illusion that guided him to follow his dreams and the dreams he created with his mother. Wonka arrives in the city where the best chocolate shops are with the hope of making his own shop (the dream he always had with his mother), due to his innocence (since he saw the best in people, he didn't know how to read but He said that he trusted what others did), he arrived at a boarding house where he signed a contract that he did not know how to read (he was left owing 1000 coins, 27 years of his life), just as there were 4 other people in that house who also fell into this trap and the girl Noodle with whom Wonka made a great bond, Wonka puts together a plan to sell chocolates and get his friends out of this prison and always take care of Noodle, along the way he has to fight against a corrupt church and 3 owners of chocolate factories (which had a monopoly), takes us on a journey of music (beautiful music, with the song from the original film Pure Imagination and many originals), colors, chocolates, fantasy and illusion in which one gets lost and when You realize the movie ended up leaving our hearts with more hope, excitement, excitement and desire to eat chocolate. It shows us a great Timothée (truly one of the best actors of the time), who manages to make Wonka his own character (nothing to envy of Johny Deep), with his own characteristics and he looks spectacular, associated with a great cast that manages to make an excellent film. I love seeing the strength that musicals have gained again in recent years, and they make us want to sing everything we do as the song said. This musical has some of the best musical scenes in recent years. And I'm going to close my review with my 2 favorite quotes from the movie: Everything good in this world began with a dream. So keep yours, and The secret is not the chocolate, what matters is the people you share it with.","

Timothy chalomet was perfect casting, the story ran at a good pace (I didn't know what the storyline was going into it) it was magical and engaging and so great for adults and kids. Hugh Grant, in his very short screen time, was brilliant and brought another element to the movie. Would definitely see this again.

Wonka," A Sweet and Magical Confection of a Film!
",msecaur,31-Jan-24,"I would have completely passed this film over if not for the fact that it was written and directed by the brilliant Paul King of ""Paddington"" and ""Paddington 2"". In anyone else's hands, it would have become yet another lifeless, overstuffed, unnecessary origin-story prequel. But in his, it becomes, like the Paddington films (albeit with a bit less slapstick bear humor and far more music) an equally whimsical, quirky, wondrous, and warm film about how one person, just by being themselves, can change the world around them, as long as they remain positive and don't give up on their dreams.I've always felt that Roald Dahl's 1964 novel, while not without its dark moments, was more joyous than many of his later books, a wondrous ode to his love of chocolate and a giddy exploration of the wish-fulfillment of being handed the keys to your own candy factory. King has tapped into and run with this sweetness, but he keeps it tempered, just as Dahl did, by following the mantra that adults are not to be trusted and make the best villains via his (and co-writer Simon Farnaby's) introduction of just enough grotesque, menacing, yet somehow funny grown-ups to keep things from becoming too easy for the protagonists without making the story too grim.Speaking of protagonists, as the title suggests, this story is all about the man himself, Willy Wonka, and while it took a few scenes for me to get used to seeing anyone but the incomparable Gene Wilder in the role, Timothee Chalamet gives a wonderful performance that definitely grows on you. By the end of the film, he literally moved me to tears. As a sort of amalgam of Chaplin's The Little Tramp and a young Harry Houdini, his youthful, wide-eyed Wonka definitely leans more towards the warm-hearted, twinkly-eyed side of Dahl's incarnation and Wilder's interpretation than the nonchalant candy maker who calmly accepts the possibility of naughty children being boiled into fudge or thrown down a garbage chute. All young Willy wants to do is make the world a better place with his chocolates. Yet Chalamet still manages to capture the eccentric, energetic, excitable, reckless, inventive man of the 1971 film version and Roald Dahl's novels without letting his quirks become overpowering (yes, I'm looking at you, Johnny Depp) such that it isn't a stretch to imagine that his Wonka and the man he will eventually become are one and the same.Timothee Chalamet also pleasantly surprises with his singing and dancing skills, which come in handy considering that, in spite of what the trailers will tell you, ""Wonka"" is an unabashedly old-fashioned movie musical courtesy of Neil Hannon's fun, catchy, and tuneful original songs. While Chalamet may not be Josh Groban, he has a sweet, natural voice with lots of color and personality, not to mention a gorgeous vibrato. For my money, I would much rather buy a record of his over Nick Jonas or Harry Styles any day, and I hope that he continues to be given the chance to further develop and show off his skills.In short, ""Wonka"" is a wonderful and unexpected surprise in more ways than one. King's childlike view of the world and his deftness at telling stories that are neither too clever for children yet too inane for adults matches perfectly with the world and words of Roald Dahl, a feeling clearly shared by Dahl's grandson Luke Kelly, co-producer on this film and guardian of Dahl's estate, who allowed ""Wonka"" to be the first time Roald Dahl's characters have ever been used in an original story. Worlds away from Tim Burton's nightmarish 2005 ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Wonka"" instead meshes beautifully with Roald Dahl's original 1964 novel and the 1971 film, giving fond nods and Easter eggs in abundance for those paying attention, while also managing to stand on its own feet as a great film, whether or not you've ever heard of Oompa-Loompas or let yourself explore a world of pure imagination before.","

Wonka," Passable
",simbiat,28-Jan-24,"It's nothing special, really, just passable. Somehow I have not watched original with Wilder, at least not fully: just bits and pieces here and there, essentially those related to memes, but I did watch the one with Depp. This new Wonka is definitely neither.Burton was definitely more into darker satire, and it definitely had a sense of certain style to it (which is Tim's strong suit). It definitely felt more a Grimm's fairy tail, if a fairy tail at all. You could still feel the magic there. I perceive Wilder's Wonka much more childish in that regard, which definitely has its own charm, and is probably more magical.New Wonka did not feel magical. Yes, there is magic, of course, but it was kind of... Meh. It was not exciting, it was not... Crazy? Or maybe not crazy enough? Which might have been a good character development point, since this is a prequel: they could have shown us how Willy slowly get more and more unhinged. We did not get that.Songs were also somewhat flat. I think Oompa Loompa's songs were ok, they did feel more refined, but that's it. And maybe they felt better simply because the character stood out more compared to the rest.Overall, it probably will be ok for kids, but adults may be be split, depending on their experience with other entries in the franchise.","

The Marvels," As Un-Marvelous as can be
",ICMooVees,13-Nov-23,"Listen, many of us have watched the MCU films and have learned that there needs to be a cohesiveness and strong villain that drives the movie. Following that thought, every good superhero movie is really more about the villain and the follow-on hero growth/action arcs that result from confronting and besting said villain. Zoom out on the early Avengers movies and you can see all that displayed because of Thanos. Some MCU movies do that better than others, and even a few DC movies nick it as well. Others fail miserably such as Ant Man Quantum thing, Shazam 1& 2 (crap big time), and WW 2 But this, this hunk of junk excuse for a movie, OMG! There were sooo many cringy scenes, biggest was the singing/dancing people! I think that was jammed in to give this schlock movie some sort of Indian/Bollwood flavor/nod because of that cringy Kamala Khan and family. UGG! This movie truly lacks any appeal. No one could even care about the villain or the vastly over used cats-eating-people to save them during a space station evac that didn't even need to be evacuated. That effect was cute and kinda jump-scary in the first move but should've stayed there. If you want a 3-second overview: It's a movie about people switching places, cats that eat people, and a lady that steals air, water, and sun. Trust me. You will regret paying to watch this. That's the whole story. No twist endings. It adds nothing to the MCU timeline and could be/should be the death-knell for Capt Marvel. It's worthless and completely forgettable. For a spot-on review, go watch the Critical Drinkers YT review. MCU needs to come up with something much, much better to save itself. I can only think that something along the lines of a Fantastic Four reboot with a Silver Surfer and a PROPER Galactus representation and arc could put the MCU back at the top. This Marvels dreck needs to be sunk into the Sun, never to return. Go away now.","

I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again.","

The Marvels," The MCU has hit rock bottom.....
",flicklover,17-Nov-23,"I don't follow the Internet for all of the news about trouble production and reshoots etc...Bur when I saw the first trailer of The Marvels I had absolutely no desire to see it. Trailers usually are put together by marketing to make a film look as good as possible but I think in the case of this film they could not hide how utterly awful this film would be. I don't believe in criticizing a film if I do r see it so I went expecting the worst with the desire to at least be entertained. This was the worst 105 minutes I have spent in a movie theater in a long time. The MCU has gone from being a franchise that had so e great films but mostly solid, reliable and memorable films. Since Avengers: Endgame, only with a couple of exceptions, the MCU has gone completely downhill. With every film, they feel so generic, so done without the care that used to be made them so popular. Now, the difference is like night and day. They have become aggressively lazy and average films. Forgettable. But none of them had been complete failures on every level until The Marvels.There really is no story to talk about here. It is a sequel to Captain Marvel that i admit is one of the pre-Endgame films I liked the least. I didn't think Brie Larson was particularly bad as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel but there was nothing special about her in the role. Here it's obvious she wasn't right for the role. She has no charisma as the character, it felt like she was phoning in the performance. In fact that is the case for everyone in this film. It's a phoned in film. There is not a single character or situation to care about. A villain that is probably the worst ever in the MCU. It's just a series of mediocre action scenes put together with so e exposition dialogue thrown in to pad the runtime. At 105 mi it's it's short by MCU standards but it felt like 3 hours!!!Hands down, the worst MCU film ever!!!Grade: F.","

The Marvels," The Twinsies!
",chand-suhas,10-Nov-23,"Dar-Benn, the leader of the Kree, is after the quantum bands. She finds one and the other is with Kamala Khan. Dar-Benn with the quantum band and her universal weapon starts the surge by creating jump points. It is upto Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel and say Professor Marvel to team up to find out what exactly Dar-Benn wants and stop her from making a bigger mess. With their powers interlinked, forcing them to keep switching into each other, how the trio manage to stop Dar-Benn forms rest of the story.The existing problem of MCU continues with The Marvels as well where we once again get a pointless addition to the franchise, whose sole purpose is to reveal that post credit scene. With a weak villain and an extremely powerful lead i.e. Captain Marvel who gets to team up with two others, no matter how much the stakes are raised, it never feels like a challenge to the mighty superhero. Instead the focus is on the teen humor.The best thing about The Marvels is it's short runtime. The humor not always work as intended though some of the jokes did work to an extent. The emotions too were on the surface level only. The reunion honestly should've been dealt better. Resorting to solving the high stakes problem in a simpler way or even randomly figuring out the solution, failed to register. On paper, it wasn't a terrible idea but when you have Captain Marvel, it is mandatory to give her a strong villain and a better story she deserves. Otherwise, there is only so much Kamala Khan can do with her jokes.","

The Marvels," See it for yourself, judge for yourself.
",jmljr-81488,14-Feb-24,"Personally, I liked this little film. Were there flaws? Sure, but every film has them. It wasn't supposed to be Endgame or Infinty War. It served the purpose of being a tidy little piece of conjunctive tissue phases 4/5 have long needed. Was it fun and funny and little over the top? Sure but thank goodness it wasn't as dark and bleak as other film companies make when building out their superhero universes. Thank goodness for that I say. My largest challenge were equally two of my favorite things in the film. For those who don't watch Disney+ two (more actually) of the primary characters were unknown to theatre audiences. While a bit of help was given explaining the backstory of one, even less was given to the other (and her lovable family). I also found (again an issue derived from the streaming shows) Nick Fury's solitary leadership and different character (from his series) might have had the reverse effect for those who had watched Disney+. I have no way of knowing if this was a film where a committee overruled the film's Director or what happened in those areas. For what did work, I enjoyed a good deal. Somewhere in here was a much stronger film than we, the audience, were able to see. I realize much of the hate the film received came far before its theatrical debut as the usual crybabies who hate anything led with women or people of color were ready and waiting to review bomb the film no matter what loose ends might have been satisfactorily tied up. And for whatever reason the primary lead continues to draw their ire is ever a mystery to me. I enjoyed the performances of all of the cast. And even when the script was a wee bit wonky, it was still somewhat on track and eventually got where it needed to logically go.","

The Marvels," A Marvelous Misfire: How 'The Marvels' Misses the Mark in the MCU
",RomeoQQ,15-Nov-23,"""The Marvels"" ambitiously attempts to intertwine the lives of its three heroines, yet the film stumbles, failing to reach the high standards set by its Marvel Cinematic Universe predecessors. The central plot mechanism, a fantastical swapping of places, comes off as a gimmick rather than an integral story element. This constant shifting hampers the development of the characters and the progression of the plot.The film's narrative, exploring intergalactic conflicts and alliances, is neither original nor engaging, missing the opportunity to delve deeper into potentially intriguing political dynamics. Additionally, the use of quantum entanglement as a plot device feels more like a convenient narrative crutch than a well-integrated scientific concept.Director Nia DaCosta's vision for ""The Marvels"" is lost amidst these narrative missteps, leaving the film feeling disjointed and lackluster. The rich character potential of Danvers, Rambeau, and Khan is underutilized, resulting in a movie that feels more like a placeholder in the MCU than a significant contribution.In summary, ""The Marvels"" is a disappointing chapter in the MCU saga, lacking the depth, coherence, and excitement that fans have come to expect from the franchise.","

The Marvels," It's not as bad as expected, but still total garbage
",andrew-hill515,09-Nov-23,"Strangely the best thing in this movie was Kamala Khan character first introduced in a pretty terrible D+ show nobody watched.Every single other thing in this movie was terrible.Captain Marvel was someone nobody wanted to see on screen again, and Bree Larson remains unable to act. She tries on her acting and drama and humour pants and found they didn't fit, so she just fumbles around and does a poor job.Rambo was introduced as an apologist for slavery and torture, got some kind of turning intangible thing going on which she got by walking for some reason, in a D+ show so she's probably new to most people.The bad guy was pathetic, the plan she sort of vaguely has, something to do with stealing an atmosphere for some reason to do something for some reason that wasn't made clear, to finish the plan of somebody but she doesn't say who that was, or what their plan was, and she is not in any way threatening. Her acting sucked also.The whole premise was idiotic. It could have been interesting if they had some kind of plan or plot before filming started instead of trying to fix it in post production, so what we got was sometimes three characters (one who fires light stuff, one who makes glowing purple stuff, and one who can apparently see light so she claimed in the script that her power is to not be blind) who sometimes switch places when they use their powers, but sometimes they don't.It's extremely inconsistent and only happens when convenient for the 'plot' or when some script writer with no sense of humour thinks it would be funny.Then lasers and flying around and fight scenes and some very sketchy CGI.And that's it. I tuned out for most of it, got bored after a while and so I can't remember most of what happened so I'll find out from a future Pitch Meeting who will do a much better job explaining the film than my semi-coherent rambling.","

The Marvels," 2002 was the last time I walked out of a movie...
",Zed-Runner,09-Nov-23,"That changed today. Forget about ""worst Marvel movie ever,"" it clears that hurdle by leagues. No, this is a contender for the worst mega budget, big studio, theatrically released film ever made. The tone veers from painfully unfunny attempts at slapstick humor to terribly acted ""this is most serious threat the world has ever faced"" moments that aim for gravitas but miss by miles, and sometimes these ridiculous tonal shifts occur in the same scene. Nothing makes sense, NOTHING. And that's the first 45 minutes before I had enough and left the theater and demanded a refund. I can't believe this script got a greenlight, let alone a $300 million budget. Speaking of which, where on this earth did all that money go? It certainly is not up on the screen as this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen. Movies made in the 90s look a thousand times better than this catastrophe. I keep reading articles about why this movie is going to fail and they all got it wrong; three incomprehensibly unlikable leads, a nonsensical script, and a woefully incompetent director are why this movie is such a failure. The reviews that say this film is bad are wrong, but it's not the critic's fault; it's just that human language hasn't evolved a word strong enough to describe just how awful it truly is. I can still smell the stink of it on my clothes.","

The Marvels," Fun, fast-paced and pretty awesome
",FeastMode,10-Nov-23,"The Marvels is a solid new entry in the MCU. It's a nice convergence of three different storylines from these three characters. The movie is very fast-paced and flies by. I would even describe some parts as hectic, but in a good way. It never lost me.It has some good action scenes, although nothing that really stands out. The sci-fi candy is delicious. And it made me laugh out loud numerous times, with clever jokes that feel organic rather than forced.The other thing I really enjoyed is a few unique aspects that make it stand out amongst other formulaic superhero movies. One involves power entanglement between the characters. And another involves the jump points (the hexagonal wormholes we've seen in other MCU movies).I had a good time with this movie and would watch it again. It's some enjoyable light-hearted entertainment.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 11/9/2023)","

If you went to see this movie and haven't kept up with all of the movies and Disney plus series, you will be scratching your head wondering what is going on.

The Marvels," A flerkin good time
",TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10-Nov-23,"The titular trio are forced to work together due to glorious comic book contrivance.The chemistry is great, and Iman Vellani is bubbling with an infectious enthusiasm. Both of the other two feel mishandled and don't deliver performances as strong as we know they are able to. The action scenes feel largely inserted rather than organic, though some do get creative and fun, such as the use of body swapping. The comedy is not as funny as that of the two Disney+ shows it follows up on - not by a long shot. The cinematography and editing have some inspired moments, especially in a few montages, one of which made me laugh harder than I have in a very long time, and is otherwise mired in the restrictive house style.This is a great feminist piece, though it is not up to the standard of the Birds of Prey film, or ones like The Babadook and 2003's Monster. It is very clear that this movie's three writers, all of them women, made sure to work in as many stereotypically female things as they could, and a lot of the best moments are when this really leans into that. I want to live on the planet where everyone sings instead of talks. There's kittens, double dutch, girls teasing each other about the boyfriend of one of them. I know some men won't like this, though to be clear not everyone who's going to hate this is a misogynist, but, seriously, fellow fellas, we can support the girls getting some representation, especially when it's this good. Where the first Captain Marvel solo pic was very much a typical western(the part of the world *and* the fiction genre) power fantasy of an individual handling things entirely on their own, this features several diverse young women supporting each other, reflecting younger generations' move away from individualism, towards found family and looking out for one another.I recommend this to every fan of the MCU - note that this could be the first one you watch. 7/10.","

",escottf,08-Feb-24,"As I say in the title, if you enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie you should enjoy this. It's not ""a work of art"" but I enjoyed it much more than a lot of the recent Marvel movies - and it is a lot more even than some of the recent ones. It's very character driven.The three main characters are delightful - and I had seen WandaVision and Ms Marvel to understand who Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan were - but my wife hadn't and seemed to enjoy it too (no explanations of powers required - you could see them).The opening is bit confusing - but it was confusing for the characters too so that makes more sense - and the 3 characters soon settled in as a team. The story was basic but made sense and the ""antagonist"" was so-so. Nick Fury was a bit low-key so it was really the Marvels' film - which was nice.Seeing Kamala's family again was great too.I definitely enjoyed it - and it will be one of the Marvel films I probably will watch on repeat a lot.Yes, there is a brief part with a species who speak in song - but we have one of the best Star Trek TNG episodes with a species who speak in allegories so? I'm glad I ignored the low ratings because I'd heard the ""if you liked Captain Marvel you'll like this"" comment from multiple sources that I value and totally agree.","

The Marvels," A Fun Time with Three Very Likeable Leads
",kjproulx,10-Nov-23,"When it comes to the character of Captain Marvel, the fan base has always seemed to be so negative. I personally have enjoyed Brie Larson's portrayal of the character and enjoyed the first film for the most part. Hearing that her story was shifting to include two other Marvel heroes as co-leads had me raising an eyebrow, but I'm always open to things changing. My biggest concern about The Marvels before seeing it was the fact that two series' on Disney+ seemed to be a prerequisite first. I've been following the entire franchise from start to finish (including the shows), and I really liked the character of Ms. Marvel, so I found myself excited. I can see how viewers who haven't followed the shows would be turned off though, which is a real problem this franchise is facing at the moment. Let's dive deeper, but also review this film on its own, which I did have a good time with.The Marvels picks up after the events of Captain Marvel, Wandavision, and Ms. Marvel. At a mere hour and 45 minutes, the film jumps right into it. The three of them begin to switch places after being exposed to energy. They quickly have to learn to work as a team to stop a looming threat. The Kree are back, led by Dar Benn (Zawe Ashton), and her motivations are all because of a storyline that feels forced to include Captain Marvel and something she did in the past. This was easily the worst part of the film, as I was completely uninterested in it. Her power stems from a Bengal, which Ms. Marvel has the other half of and that was far more interesting. Sadly, the villain as a whole just felt like a device instead of a fleshed-out character. The villain almost hurt the film a little too much for me, but the trio of actresses here was a joy to watch.Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris are absolutely stellar as a trio working together. Their chemistry was so much fun to watch. It's easily the reason I'm giving the villain storyline a pass and saying I enjoyed the movie. The majority of the movie is about them learning to use their powers together and I couldn't get enough of it honestly. On top of that, the integration of Kamala Khan's family was hilarious and used perfectly. I also enjoyed the subtle, quiet moments where they share heart-to-hearts with one another. Certain conversations between Carol and Monica actually had me tearing up. The subtle touches here and there were very nice. The action is surprisingly fun to watch and the CGI didn't stand out as much as it did to me in the first Captain Marvel film, but yes, the elephant in the room here is that this film isn't accessible to everyone, which is a real shame.This is the part that bothers me to even have to mention, but here we go. From Iron Man to Avengers: Endgame, there was always a plan and it was only a couple of movies a year to follow. I'm someone who chooses to follow everything, even if it's good or bad because I would like to see where everything eventually builds to. I can sense another finale in the coming years, but they are simply making far too many projects for the average viewer to follow. I fear that Avengers movies won't even draw the crowds they used to once they finally come out. This frustrates me because the majority of the projects are still good for the most part. It's just that there's too much and far too many characters. This is coming from someone who likes or loves a lot of the newest characters, so I can only imagine how fans who have fallen off the franchise are feeling. Anyways, we're here to discuss The Marvels.In the end, The Marvels is a solid popcorn flick that I sat back and had a good time with. If the cast didn't work so well together and the humour didn't work for me, I would be calling this a lacklustre movie all around. Nia DaCosta definitely pulled the best performances she could out of these actresses and I commend her for that. I also just have to say that the standout of this film is Iman Vellani. I loved her in Ms. Marvel and she shines again here. She's just so happy to be a part of this franchise and it really shows. There are certain scenes that will annoy viewers, but honestly, I recommend this one to fans of the MCU, unless you're someone who already dislikes any of these characters/actresses. Otherwise, it's not great by any means, but I had a good time and I think others will too.","

Regardless of that stuff I loved The Marvels definitely one of more satisfying superhero experiences to me especially if you void out the flaws or not mind them much. It's a spectacular film one of the shortest of the bunch too if it wasn't for half hour of trailers it would've felt like a breeze which is fine.

",dh-51489,03-Feb-24,"Let me start by saying that I don't rate everything I see. It usually has to be really good - or really, REALLY bad. Then there are the times when the rating is so far off the mark that it really gets my gall. The current rating for this MCU outing is one of those times...Before embarking on this super hero adventure, I watched Ms Marvel to help better understand one of The Marvels' main characters. So glad I did! Not only did it clarify who's who, the 6 part mini series was some of the best entertainment I've enjoyed of late. Ironically, I was 'driven' to rate it for the same reason I'm rating this as well.Rather than bore you with a deep dive into the cinematic MCU's inability to correctly capture the spirit of the original comics (I never read them), or try to show off with an analysis of racial stereotyping and Hollywood's failure to address it (give me a break), I will tell you this about The Marvels: IT'S A LOT OF FUN!!!The story is good.The acting is good.The special effects are FANTASTIC.It really is top-notch entertainment for the whole family.I never spoil, so I have to be careful with my formulation when discussing a scene about three quarters of the way into the film... Let's just say that it stems from a familiar 'cat' on the space station - and that it managed to provoke a genuine belly laugh from me.Don't listen to the haters!

Kamala and Monica are awesome characters, and though Carol is a bit boring character by herself, she adds a needed contrast as part of the marvels team.The humour was great. Especially the cat stuff was pure gold, and the dynamics between the main characters were really succesful. Also Fury and the Khan family were fun to watch.The plot was all in all okay.The special effects look a lot better than on some of the other recent mcu pieces (Ant-man etc).Cons:
The main events were cut too short due the length of the movie, leaving the plot a little shallow. So this one could've actually been a little longer.Even though I love cats, I think there were simply too many of them, considering the amount of screen time they actually got.The main villain was awkward. I couldn't tell if she was badly directed or if the acting was bad, but she just seemed to be really out of place. Most certainly she was badly written.All in all, it was an okay movie with entertaining action bits and comedy. That's certainly more than we got to see from mcu in 2023 as a whole.","

The Marvels," Decent Movie
",GokuMeatrider,11-Feb-24,"Kamala and Monica carried the movie Dar benn wasn't even close to comic book accurate but it is nice to see the relationship ship between the Marvels. It was funny when the cats started eating people but the design for Dar Benn was not it. It had good acting, effects, fights, and visuals and the outfits for the Marvels are Amazing I'm glad we got to see Nick furry again, but he didn't really do much as I thought that he could've had way more potential in the movie. It's way better then the first one but this movie overall doesn't deserve all this hate cause it wasn't that good wasn't that bad but decent.","

The Marvels," It was a good movie.
",subxerogravity,10-Nov-23,"That's all I can really say about the Marvels it was a good movie. As someone who loves these Marvel movies I am noticing that the magic is wearing down. Nothing about this movie is epic enough to keep me wanting to come back to see it over and over again and I can tell the trill is gone because even the end credit did nothing for me, but as a stand alone movie it was very enjoyable.Ms. Marvel is the total package of cute teenaged superhero. I could have saw an entire movie with her. I felt I could have used more of Monica Rambeau seeing that out of the three this is the first real showcasing of her power (but I'm bias on that), and ofcourse Sam L. Jackson as Fury was fantastic.One problem that I had with this movie that I also had with Captain Marvel is that it did not feel big enough to be a Marvel Movie, it felt closer to one of the Disney Plus shows.But overall i had a blast and thankfully it was not a long ride. It gave just enough enjoyment.","

",KM1701,10-Feb-24,"To me this was like a whacky crossover special comic book brought to life! It brought together three characters who stories throughout the years intertwined as much as their powers do in the film. It pulled their arcs together like a crossover comic and continued all three of them beautifully. From characters facing concequences for pervious actions to follow up on emotional points. And the three leads play off each other so well. I had a fantastic time with this movie. To me it was fun, comic book whacky, with a lot heart and certainly made me emotional. People will hate on it for a dozen reasons and then some but if you're looking for a fun superhero flick this is for you!","

The Marvels," Very Bad Movie
",cinemapersonified,01-Dec-23,"Rating: 3.8
Overall, a complete mess as the movie does not hit on any angles and there are obvious points where the studio interfered with the cut, bringing into question what the direction of Marvel is going forward.Very Bad Direction (The cut was just very bad and felt like the studio had a major say in how they trimmed it; the macro scenes were just very boring and the fight scenes were not engaging at all as she just relied too much on CGI to make it interesting; the interpersonal scenes were lacking in the movie as it never felt like it furthered the conflict or the relationships between the characters (especially The Marvels as there was like only one scene meant for team building), it felt like there were many scenes for character building that were cut; the direction of actors was very bad because it just felt like none of the cast had any chemistry or felt convincing in the emotional moments of the movie), Bad to Pretty Bad Acting (Bad from Brie Larson (Very Monotonous with her line delivery and just did not carry the movie the way she should've; did not have any chemistry with her castmates), Pretty Bad from Teyonah Parris (Kinda a forgettable performance cause she felt like an aftermath after the other two Marvels), Pretty Bad from Iman Vellani (More of a bad writing issue but felt very forced being the teen archetype for the group (that made it seem more annoying than playful); had some moments where she did shine), Bad from Zawe Ashton (Such a forgettable performance as she was just a generic villain and not convincing at all), Pretty Bad from Samuel L. Jackson (Put like no effort into the performance and just did not feel as good as his other Nick Fury performances (tries to be the comedic relief character and it fails pretty hard)), Bad from the rest of the cast (Just stiff, forced performances all around and no chemistry in any of the scenes)), Very Bad Story (One of the biggest issues for the movie as it felt like the conflict was not conveyed well at all (and was not presented as a big issue), the personal conflict between the characters was also not handled well at all; the story construction was very bad as there practically was no rising action or character developing, the conflict introduction was very poor and not good (and does not feel like a really interesting issue), it felt like a lot of scenes were cut that could've added depth to the movie as there were a lot of cuts in the story to just move the plot forward (but this created a lot of questions); the character writing was bad for the most part as the characters really aren't that interesting at all and their conflicts are not really that compelling (though Ms. Marvel's was the most interesting as it blended the teen-superhero archetype with a South-Asian/American background)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was incredibly cringey and just not good (felt like it was written by someone who read a synopsis of what a Marvel movie should sound like and wrote that as their first screenplay); the jokes were just very forced and not funny at all (the more dramatic elements were funnier with how cringey they were), tried way too hard for Marvel humor and it rarely hits; the South Asian vernacular was just more stereotypical than funny (and as a result just felt very shallow); the symbolism was just so shallow and the message was overt for what they were going for; the foreshadowing was pretty obvious as the movie was very formulaic), Decent Score (felt very similar to other comic book movies)/ Pretty Bad Soundtrack (so on-the-nose that it was laughable), Decent Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound (Similar to other Marvel movies, ADR for the singing was so obvious), Very Bad Editing (Felt super amateur and the cut for the movie was just so bad), Terrible to Very Bad Visual Effects (Felt so cheap and tacky (worse than Thor 4)), Pretty Good Production Design (Similar to other Marvel movies), Pretty Good Makeup, Pretty Good Costumes, Plot Structure was a concern as there were issues with lack of rising action (scenes definitely cut) and the climax was so short that it felt anticlimactic, Pacing was so fast that there was no time to take in what was going on (the runtime could have definitely been added too to add more depth to the story and slow the pace down), Climax was super anticlimactic and like a felt very formulaic Marvel movie, Tone was incredibly Marvel and really tried to go for that teenage Marvel feel during the Ms. Marvel moments (and both did not hit the mark and dragged the movie down by making it formulaic)","

The Marvels," It achieves everything it sets out to do
",LivingWitness,12-Feb-24,"All this movie was trying to be was a superhero movie that appeals to twelve-year-olds. It achieves that. If I had have seen this when I was twelve, it probably would have been my favourite MCU movie ever.I can see why a lot of people were unhappy with this one because it doesn't really do much beyond that, and there have been much better ones in the last few years. However, I think people are being a bit silly if they saw this movie and expected it to be anything other than a CGI heavy movie for 12-year-olds.For the most part, I do think this movie works, though. Pretty much all the jokes land, which hasn't always been a given in the MCU movies of the last five years or so. The action sequences are middle of the road, but you can follow what's happening and there's at least some kind of point to them.I don't think the CGI in this movie is quite as good as the CGI in Guardians of the Galaxy 3. However, it never looks cheap, either. I also feel like they probably should have just picked an aspect ratio and stuck with it because changing the aspect ratio in certain scenes didn't really add anything. This was a problem Thor: Love and Thunder had as well.Overall, this movie was fine. There's been much better MCU movies over the years, but this is nowhere near as bad as some people are making it out to be.","

That said the pace of this movie is so weird it starts at a jog and never really calms down anywhere. I'm not sure why people were surprised a black director made a black movie, but racism exists and you have to ignore that. Honestly there were some cool ideas and it was mostly well acted. It just had weird pacing and yeah i think it would really help if the movies broke up and became their own thing again so they weren't telling just a part of a story. It's nice to watch a movie and feel like it accomplished something. To feel in the middle of something definitely isn't as satisfying.","

The Marvels," Better than I thought it would be
",blakewhitelaw,08-Feb-24,"I really don't understand the hate this movie received. It is a fun romp through the universe with great action, decent humor and some really heart felt moments.While far from the best Marvel Studios has produced its still well worth the hour and a half I invested in watching it. Brie Larson's performance as Carol Danvers is again top notch. We see more emotion this time from a Carol who's not the cocksure pilot from the first movie who is questioning some of her past choices and haunted by them. Teyonah Parris gives a convincing turn as Monica Rambeau (I'm still not in love with the last name) searching for a connection to her lost mother. I feel the real star is Imra Vellani as Kamala Kahn. Her sense of wonder and constant desire to help others should inspire us all.I was less taken by the antagonist Bar-Denn. We've seen better motivated ""tying to restore out world"" tropes before but this isn't enough of a downside to detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.The various suppoting casts puts in a good showing and who can resist and entire family of flerkens saving the ""eating"" all the station staff to save them.","

Bar possibly Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, but even she looked a bit bewildered and gormless.Visuals were good, but an over-reliance on CGI was self-evident.

",Skruffbagg,14-Nov-23,"This is it folks, the lowest point Marvel Studios has ever sunk to, and after the last 3 years, that is really saying something. This is truly bottom of the barrel stuff.I went into this film with an open mind, despite not being particularly attached to any of these heroes, but it's a total mess. It's borderline incoherent and appears to have been haphazardly stitched together in the editing room like some sort of Frankenstein's monster... and it shows.Brie Larson looks bored and uninterested for much of the film, and Teyonah Parris plays a character nobody cares about like she knows it. The one bright spark is Iman Vellani, who looks like she's genuinely having fun and it shows in her performance. I haven't seen the Ms Marvel show but I might actually give it a watch now. Probably not though.It's sad to see what the MCU has become; a muddled, directionless mess with bad CGI taking the place of good screenplays, tight and clever writing, and likeable characters that you actually care about.Where do they go from here? Who's knows, but I would give this a swerve if I were you.","

The Marvels," The latest Marvel film arrives in a rushed and scattered manner, leaving little to entertain you with.
",movieman6-413-929510,09-Nov-23,"The Marvels is the sequel to Captain Marvel. This sequel is in-depth and written in part by Nia DaCosta, director of Little Woods and the 2021 Candyman sequel.After Captain Marvel's (Brie Larson) final actions with the Kree Empire, the tyrannical Kree Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) tries in her own way to return the Kree Empire to its former glory. These actions put other worlds at risk.Captain Marvel tries to stop Dar-Benn, only to find her powers tangled with those of Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani). When one of them uses their powers, they switch positions with each other. The three must work together during this force entanglement to stop Dar-Benn.This new film from the Marvel film series actually comes with some housework for the viewers. To clearly understand everything in this film, she actually expects you to be familiar with the first Captain Marvel film and the Marvel Disney+ series WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. Without this knowledge, there is a chance that you will not be able to clearly understand everything that exactly happened in this movie. A lack of this information can only make this film seem more obscure. Furthermore, the film sometimes seems a bit rushed and scattered. This could also be because the three writers of the film are not yet at the beginning side. For Nia DaCosta, this is only her third writing effort. The other two writers have only written stories from TV series. Although some of this series are also part of Marvel, this unfortunately did not provide much further experience.When the characters use their powers and move places, it only makes the events in the beginning of the film even more unclear. Especially when they don't seem to change places every time they use their powers, something that isn't really explained in detail in the film. The changing of superpowers is also something that has been used before in superhero films, such as in Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Even though this film had its limited aspects, she still managed to turn it into something comical every now and then.Due to the rushed pace and small aspects of this film, there seems to have been little room for some light moments of comedy. The young Iman Vellani knows how to provide some cheerful moments, but unfortunately this is quickly overshadowed by the more serious tone of the rest of the film and her co-stars. Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris play characters who have a history with each other, but in this film they are given little time and opportunities to do something with it. This is Samuel L. Jackson's 15th Marvel film project, but he doesn't get many opportunities to do anything special in this film and has just some room for light comedy moments. Zawe Ashton also plays more of a standard villain, which you as a viewer don't really care about.Due to the rushed aspects behind the film, the visual effects do not always appear convincing. When a green screen or further CGI is used, this is unfortunately visible. The visibility of this visual effects word sometimes even takes you out of the story.","

The Marvels," Stronger than the first
",masonsaul,11-Nov-23,"The Marvels is a lot better than the original even if it's still using sky beams 33 films in. The shorter run time helps a lot more than it hinders and it's just a really funny, wacky cosmic adventure that manages to be a contained story whilst still setting up exciting things for the future.Brie Larson is great, given so much more to work with this time so Carol has more personality and greater depth. She's still as funny as before but more remorseful, dealing with both the legacy and fallout of her actions as a soldier as well as feeling guilt over not spending as much time on Earth as she should've.Teyonah Parris gets the majority of the exposition yet still makes Monica a fully fledged character again. There's an initial unease at being reunited with Carol in these circumstances whilst still dealing with everything post blip that she's so good at conveying.Iman Vellani is the best though, improving everything with her presence. The enthusiasm she has for simply being in this world remains so genuine and as she's finally meeting her idol there's so much fun to be had when she's constantly freaking out. There's plenty of emotional heft too as she sees first-hand the sacrifice required to be a hero.Samuel L. Jackson is back to his fun loving version of Fury which feels like a huge apology for Secret Invasion. Zawe Ashton is another one-note MCU villain who has fun chewing scenery with some solid motivation until the third act betrays it all for a big CGI fight that doesn't make sense for the character.Nia DaCosta's direction isn't entirely free of studio intervention or feeling occasionally voiceless but this is still some of the strongest direction recently, helped by the body swapping antics of the plot which means the action sequences have a unique selling point for this one.The MCU has serious ongoing issues with its use of CGI and there's no doubt there's some weak points here (with a likely chance the team was massively overworked). However, the film generally looks pretty good in that department and the added time thanks to a later release date clearly helped a lot.","

Also went pretty badly at the box office. But that doesn't mean it's the end of the MCU.They still got some upcoming Marvel movies for next year so, it should be fine for now.

The Marvels," Dumb popcorn movie with flashes of fun
",JakeBrinkman,15-Feb-24,"It's a fun popcorn movie with action and laughs, but every single aspect of it crumbles to pieces when you apply any semblance of logic.When the movie commits to a scene, it's a lot of fun. The intro action sequence could have had minor improvements, but it did a great job of making me excited for the rest of the movie. Unlike most of the top IMDb reviews, I thought Nick Fury's climax was incredible, but only because they fully committed to the absurdity, and this scene is the only reason I rated this movie as high as I did.The biggest problem is that everything is completely forgettable. I watched it last night, and I already can't tell you the villan's name. Ms Marvel is a likable character, but there isn't one single person in the movie that is given any sort of character development or backstory that isn't already shown in their other shows or movies. The only non-Earth planet that I can remember anything about, I only remember it because it had the potential to be just as memorable and enjoyable as Nick Fury's arc, but as soon as they introduced it, they chickened out and went back to boring normalcy instead of fully committing.The second biggest problem is that anyone with an intro course understanding of physics would continuously cringe at the dozens of times that the most basic laws of physics are completely broken and ignored.","

The Marvels," MCUs lowest point
",milstar,30-Nov-23,"The Marvels is a film like Barbie, made for women and by women, and yet, wasn't half as successful as Barbie and majority of their audience were men. As one of them, who skipped Barbie (as opposed to women who skipped this), I gotta say this was complete waste of time (and money). It's just a bad movie. But let's start from the beginning.Brie Larson wasn't a very good choice for any Marvel superheroine, certainly not for an obscure character like Captain Marvel. But the movie came and the rest is history. And now its half-sequel is here. And boy, as I stated already, it was royally bad. The director, who skipped the post-production on The Marvels middle-way thru, attempted to sell her film as wacky, goofy fun. I can only say this. The Marvels is not wacky, but it is goofy. And goofy not in a good way. Superheroes are goofy by default, but this took the game a step further.The plot is the biggest flaw. It lost its marbles after the first ten minutes and I didn't care about it for the rest of its 105mins running time. Which seems too short for these kinds of films, although 105mins was too much for me. The biggest selling gimmick, our trio exchanging powers, even after all obscure explanations, never really made any sense and their switching powers seem to work only when filmmakers tell you they work. Not one of the three heroines has a meaningful character arc, the movie should be about Carol Danvers, and while there was room for all three, I never had the feeling they were experiencing an emotional journey. Kamala just wants to be there, Monica acts like a job drone and Carol in the search of something that is even unknown to her. Even the villain is just a flat-out cardboard villain. People singing sequence is gross. Kittens swallowing people as a means of transportation massive gross. Music apart from generic bombastic tunes is meh, CGI atrocious, the editing a work of hack...a fail on very single level. The eponymous trio lacks chemistry. Kamala's quotes are sophomoric, but given she is an overexcited teenage girl, that can be forgiven, Monica seems the most level-headed of the trio, and Brie surprisingly acted less robotic and more nuanced than in the original Captain Marvel (those trailers didn't do her justice), but not in a game-changing manner.I guess we are reaching now the twilight of superheroes. All pointing that similar fate awaits Aquaman 2.","

And it still had some great fight scenes. I think edge lords have gotten so used to the dark grittiness of some of the movies and forgot how to just enjoy movies. I gave up on taking these movies seriously a long time ago. Yes, it's not up to the standard of the early MCU, but it's never going to get back to that - if you're going to compare sequels to the same standard as originals (in any genre) you're just asking for disappointment.

There's a musical in the second act AND a new Disney Princess.Smh.The pacing in the movie is horrible as is the fact that the hero of the film has absolutely no problem putting a child in danger, doing so deliberately multiple times throughout.Monica was a simp who suddenly knew how to control her powers after two days together with Carol and Kamala? Kamala is a ninja all of a sudden? This was Marvel's version of WW84.","

The Marvels," Fun time thats all i asked for
",jenhae,09-Nov-23,This feels like such a superhero movie. Like oldschool. You know when superheroes were too nerdy for the general population and they felt a bit weird? That what this feels like. I get that that means a lot of people will be disappointed. If you expect too much you will not like this movie.However if you wanna be entertained by three charismatic leads than this is the movie for you. Its just lighthearted fun. The shorter runtime also means that for once you do not feel overwhelmed while watching. It also means you probably won't be talking about this movie for months. But it was worth it watching it at the theater and i will definitly rewatch it again if i wanna have a good 105 minutes of entertainment. Expectation is really everything with this movie. Not everything needs to be a masterpiece sometimes its enough to make viewers smile and laugh and not think too hard.,"

The Marvels," A disgrace to Marvel
",writetothehead,11-Nov-23,"If you can't come up with story which is as good as recent Endgame, Spiderman, Dr Strange then don't come up with something which is as lousy as this.Nothing was right from start to end. Usually the first few minutes is the ideal time to capture the attention of the audience but this movie fails to do that miserably. It was so confusing that I lost interest from the start.By the time you start to acknowledge and make peace with the fact that this is going to be a waste of time but you should just sit back and enjoy the movie and finish your popcorn, you figure out that you have watched dozens of the same predictable plot.Extremely extremely disappointed at myself for eagerly waiting for this movie and suggesting friends to watch the first day first show.Will never ever trust trailers of movies. From now on will wait and watch after reading reviews and ratings.","

The Marvels," Rambeau: First Blood.
",southdavid,18-Nov-23,"Get your ""unhelpful"" button presses ready because, whilst it's not without a couple of issues, I enjoyed ""The Marvels"" quite a bit.Whilst investigating an anomaly in deep space, Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) inexplicable swaps places with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) who is working on the space platform in low orbit and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) who is at her family home in New Jersey. With the trio wildly leaping between locations, they learn that Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) the new leader of the Kree has the other quantum band and is using the power of it to tear holes in space time. When the three heroes get together, they try and learn about why they are switching and whether they can get on the same page enough to stop Dar-Benn.I will say that this might be the film that crossed the threshold for people who haven't religiously watched the entirety of the MCU output so far. Whilst it does briefly cover these salient events, you really need to have seen ""Captain Marvel"", as well as the ""Wandavision"" and ""Ms. Marvel"" TV series to actually know who our three leads are. There's a cameo of a character with even less explanation if you've not seen the last two ""Thor"" movies. Whilst I'm doing the criticisms, I think that the planet where the inhabitants communicate through song was better in idea than it was execution and, whilst I love Zawe Ashton, and she's fine here (with Daniel Ings as another British comedy actor in a key role), we've seen a lot of 'justified' villains recently and her outcome was a bit underwhelming.As I say though, I enjoyed the film. I am that man that's eagerly devouring the MCU projects whenever they come out and so did know who everyone was - and was happy to see many of them again. I love Kamala's family in the series and I'm happy they get so much play here. Iman Vellani remains the most charming actress and is delightful throughout this and I thought that the chemistry between the three leads was excellent. The comedy is mostly pushed it he direction of Nick Fury, and his B-Story about trying to save the SABRE space station and I though it worked, including the ""Memories"" scene. It doesn't suffer from any of the visual effects issues that the MCU has suffered from recently and I thought, just to counter the criticism that I've seen about this online, that the plot was easy to follow.I certainly enjoyed this more that ""Love and Thunder"" or ""Quantumania"" and I don't think, even if it proves to be the worst performing film at the box office, it deserves to be lumped in with them.","

The Marvels," Sad excuse of a MCU movie
",sydsyc,12-Nov-23,"By now, clearly no one expects Marvel to produce anything decent that is making a profit at the box office. But with this movie, Marvel/Disney has outdone itself! This movie is an incoherent, unmitigated disaster that was so expensive and has such a bad box office result, that this might actually be a final breaking point for the MCU. The story, the villain and the main characters are a complete mess. The dialogues are cringy and the only positive thing is, that this is one of the shortest if not the shortest MCU movie! It was the Äquivalent of a root canal surgery done by a blind plumber who ate too much garlic for dinner. One can only hope that Marvel will wake up when this movie, as predicted, will have the worst box office result ever. But at this point, I really doubt that!","

The Marvels," Good standalone buddy adventure
",gavinp9,11-Nov-23,"'The Marvels' is the sequel to 'Captain Marvel' and the first time we've seen Carol Danvers (Larson) since 'Avengers: Endgame'. The difference this time is that this time, fate brings her, Monica Rambeau (Parris, introduced in 'WandaVision') and Kamala Khan (Vellani, introduced in 'Ms Marvel') together to stop the new Kree threat this time, Dar-Benn (Ashton). Tying it all together, like he's done so many times, in Nick Fury (Jackson) - but he has a lot more levity here than in 'Secret Invasion', thankfully.There's a bit of background to the Kree/Skull war, but not too much - but the best aliens are still the cats/Flerken, who have a nice mini-role to play. Special mention to the singing/choreography-dancing aliens on the water planet too. Besides stopping the Kree from destroying more worlds, the main plot point is the three lead characters finding out how to use their light-powers together and complement heach other. This is helped by Kamala enthusiasm and teenage idealism - like the show, this is a real breath of fresh air and balances well with Carol and Monica.We also get Kamala's mum, dad and brother, who also add some nice heart and humour, including with Fury and during the initial place-swapping scenes. There's some middling battle scenes, but some nice CGI and planets throughout. The ending is mostly satisfying, with a good mid-credits scene.","

The Marvels," Goose the Cat, the Marvels and the shortest MCU film
",arvinjanasis,09-Nov-23,"""Higher.. Further.. Faster..""With Loki Season 2 having its finale this week, it kinda feels like a back to back Marvel treat for fans with the release of The Marvels, the sequel to 2019's Captain Marvel.No hate, but here's my review (SPOILERS ahead - well sort of)The Marvels brings back our cosmic heroes Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan where the three faces quite a problem with the use of their powers but along that, they will also face a not so much of a threat villain who's purpose is to destroy planets that Danvers dear hold in order to save a dying planet - so yeah typical revenge story. During the course of the movie, things were explained why Monica feel off towards Danvers, what was she doing after the events of Wandavision as well as the whereabouts of Danvers, the life of Fury in space, Kamala just living her ""not so"" ordinary life and some side quests such as visiting different planets, the Flerken family and how the three will use their powers despite the power switch that they were experiencing.-Technically, the story is fast paced with new characters that I am not so sure if we will be able to remember after this film. But all in all, it is an enjoyable and entertaining film.As for the character development of the three main, it was good. Good seeing them interact and I agree that Kamala felt like she was the heart of this film. She was able to connect to both Danvers and Monica and strengthen their bond. Danvers' character also felt more established here compared to her previous Marvel films however it kind of felt like she was depowered here but that was explained and showed in the film.And finally, as for the ""fan service"" of this film, it was bananas! Though I was spoiled days before watching the film, it was still good seeing it in the actual film.All I can say, The Marvels felt more like a ""filler"" or a preparation / setup to what has to come in the future of Marvel Cinematic Universe. The post credits scene(s) are the bridge to the future of MCU. It was a sweet setup but I hope they won't screw this up. Don't ruin the hype Marvel and fans alike.This is one of those ""decent - entertaining"" recent MCU films.The Marvels is a 7/10 for me. I really did enjoy it but as a quality film? See it for yourself. But as for the experience, this was 9/10. One of my best cinema experience (show in another post)The real MVP was Goose.","

The Marvels," Short and fun action, for a change.
",donmurray29,11-Nov-23,"Giving this an 8/10 ratingAfter the glorious 'Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3', I was kind of worried how this one will play out, people were already writing it off before anything was done. Well, I'm very happy with this film, for a start, it's the shortest Marvel film on the cinema, and that's good. It's very lean, and I mean, lean, straight to the point.The story itself is the age old one, the quest of... well if you see the film you will know. It has lots of new and old faces, Samuel L jackson is playing Nick Fury for the last time here, but that can change, and yes there is end credit extra, just one this time.The vfx are much better too, the script is very tight, and there is comedy for sure, which does work. I must admit it does feel like they tried the look and feel of a 'Bollywood' film, it does there, in my opinion, which is not a bad thing. Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani, interact very well and certainly have been well fight trained, as the action does not let up, and the film is just fun, and that is enough. That is why I gave it an 8/10, it's un and get's the job done.","

",benjaminskylerhill,10-Nov-23,"It's just kind of bad, making it significantly better than I expected it to be.Starting with the good, I genuinely liked that this movie is intentionally silly. The teleportation premise makes for some genuinely amusing visual gags, and a great deal of absurd concepts made their way in here and the weirdness is embraced with glee.And, I liked the idea behind the villain and her motivations. Really, many of the ideas present in this movie are compelling ones.Sadly, none of them retain their intrigue in the execution.The execution of this film's plot, themes, and character arcs is all so...easy. Everything is written to wrap up in the most obvious, pandering, convenient possible way, leaving plenty of unfinished threads and stripping the story of any intelligence it may have had.And that's how this movie ends up feeling: unfinished.

The Marvels," Light Breezy Fun and A Potential Relaunch for the Franchise
",Garcwrites,08-Nov-23,"I'm not sure where to start with this movie but it's not a girly girl's movie or even a message-heavy one like I heard it would be. It's a superhero movie. I guess, having three female leads and a female villain is just too much for some.Whatever's wrong with this movie comes down to the writing - that has its moments of greatness and fun - and the direction. It's not a complete mess since the movie holds up enough to have an exciting movie-going experience and very interesting implications for the future. Still, in the hands of a more experienced director and writer(s), this could have soared through the top of the box office with nothing for the haters to chew on.The leads have amazing chemistry. I thought Larson would have the best chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson because I've seen them work really well off of each other, but that magic is there with Vellani and Parris. Carol and Monica's storyline works so well, they could have milked it a little more but what's there serves its purpose, it enriches their history, adds layers to the plot and the MCU, and woves a nice touch of emotions to the movie. Vellani is charming throughout, her Kamala is a joy that fits in seamlessly with Carol and Monica. This team-up has a nice balance. We become attached to the characters and each of them a moment to shine or an emotional high at some point in the movie. The trio is the film's greatest strength, not just because of their chemistry and acting ability, but also their comedic timing. Vellani excels here, she's a bit more of the comedic relief, with Parris more of the straight man, and Larson a bit of both. The humor is well-balanced, it doesn't detract from the stakes.They did not skimp on the action scenes, there are plenty, nicely choreographed and their execution is more often great to serviceable than not and involves more people than you'd think. The same goes for the visual effects, they are solid better than in the trailers. However, this movie still suffers from what is a constant Marvel problem regarding most of their villains, they are a bit mustache-twirly. Dar-Benn doesn't have one but she's not given nearly enough to make her a compelling villain. The storyline is there, where we can see the potential depth and her character's motivation but Ashton is not given the time, yet she still manages to make it work.The Marvels could have been longer but this run-time works, it's short and sweet. It also has the same ""exciting things to come"" feel from earlier MCU movies even without the post-credit scenes.By @garcwrites.","

The Marvels," Marvel best Captain Marvel film yet.
",GusherPop,11-Nov-23,"As with a lot of studio-created girl groups, the women fronting ""The Marvels"" are carefully styled, wear coordinated outfits during their big numbers, have a few flashily choreographed moves and, because they've clearly put in the rehearsal time, know how to harmonize (more or less). The group has been created for maximum bankability, familiarity and relatability, and to that instrumental end, it delivers exactly what you expect of it and not a single thing, idea or beat more. Its members are nice, even at their most ostensibly fierce, and so unrelievedly bland that it feels like an affront, especially to all the women here doing so much hard work.This is the 33rd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which continues to expand even as its cultural interest and resonance diminish. ""The Marvels"" will dominate the box office, of course, at least during its opening weekend, just because it will flood theaters. It's pointless complaining, I know (believe me), but it's frustrating what weak tea this movie is because the director, Nia DaCosta (""Little Woods,"" ""Candyman""), has talent, the cast is appealing, and there's a lightly gonzo scene that shows you what the other 100 minutes could have been. It's almost as if the suits at Marvel Studios know it doesn't matter if their movies are any good. Once again, Brie Larson plays Captain Marvel a.k.a. Carol Danvers, a former Air Force pilot who inadvertently picked up her superpowers once upon a time. She kept on flying throughout the decades, though sometimes without a craft, hurtling through space and fighting alongside the Avengers all while maintaining her dewily youthful looks. When she first appears here, she is hanging out with her scene-stealing orange tabby, Goose (played by Tango and Nemo), on her spaceship and doing something important-looking. Soon, with Goose perched on one shoulder - no spacesuits here - this very special cat lady is zipping off to a planet and into another over-plotted, overextended escapade. This time she's joined by two super-empowered beings from the small screen: Kamala Khan a.k.a. Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani), a Captain Marvel superfan from Jersey City (and Disney+); and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), an astronaut (introduced as an adult in the series ""WandaVision"") who's part of S. A. B. E. R. In the interest of moving this review along - and because I had no idea what Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) was doing in space with a bunch of uniformed lackeys (other than barking orders with his usual gruffness) - here is how the movie's production notes describe S. A. B. E. R: ""a space station covertly acting as Earth's first point of contact and defense from a rapidly expanding universe."" Written by DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik, ""The Marvels"" reunites old friends and foes while introducing new characters and developments, all of which will presumably be folded into future installments, as is the Marvel way. The big fights and minor tension are principally generated by the villainous Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the ruler (or, in Marvel-speak, Supremor) of the Kree people; she wields a mighty hammer and bears a grudge against Captain Marvel. In one of the larger set pieces, Dar-Benn takes brutal aim against other enemies. As terrified men, women and children flee and buildings fall, the scene briefly summons up visions of our world, which the movie otherwise phenomenally shows the true nature of Marvel. As is always the case with Marvel directors, DaCosta's principal job seems to be to keep the greased gears moving as she folds in innumerable close-ups of happy, sad and mad faces, all of which are meant to remind viewers that their heroes are just like us, only super. To underscore this point, Kamala's fangirl shtick goes on too long; the character is doodling images of her idol when the movie opens and sometime later wears a T-shirt emblazoned with Captain Marvel's image. Once the character calms down, so does Vellani, an appealing performer with comic timing who nicely bounces off both Larson and Parris. They, in turn, have been given an unfortunate surrogate mother-daughter dynamic that is fortunately underdeveloped because all you really want to do is watch Goose, who's indeed golden.","

",stevendbeard,10-Nov-23,"I saw The Marvels, starring Brie Larson-Fast X, Kong: Skull Island; Teyonah Parris-Candyman_2021, Point Blank_2019; Iman Vellani-Ms. Marvel_tv; Zawe Ashton-Greta, Nocturnal Animals and Samuel L. Jackson-Shaft_2019, Snakes on a Plane.This is a sequel to the Captain Marvel movie starring Brie/Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel and it's also a continuation from the tv series Ms. Marvel & WandaVision. Iman/Kamala/Ms. Marvel was in Ms. Marvel and Teyonah/Monica Rambeau/Spectrum was in WandaVision. It's written & directed by Nia DaCosta who also directed Candyman_2021. Brie makes good on her promise to destroy The Supreme Intelligence, which has repercussions with the Kree and Skrulls-it even earns Brie the nickname, The Annihlator. Zawe is a Kree that survives and gets her hands on a Cosmic Bangle-looks like an arm bracelet-and she then goes seeking revenge on Brie. When Zawe uses the bangle, it causes Brie, Teyonah and Iman to switch places with each other when they use their powers. Samuel returns as Nick Fury-he must have it in his contract to be in any Marvel movie. There is plenty of action, of course, and humor-the Flerkens are aliens that look like cats but swallow things and can regurgitates them later. There are lots of body switching scenes that are entertaining and as the end credits start, there is a scene hinting at some different heroes but nothing at the very end-except you can hear, but not see, a Flerken doing what a Flerken does.It's rated PG-13 for action, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.It's not the best super hero movie I have ever seen but it is entertaining. I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

The girl playing Ms Marvel was by far the most endearing.The Rambo character is a just a whole load of nothing and her acting for the post credit scene was embarrassing.

The Marvels," It's crazy, but it's not that bad
",Elvis-Del-Valle,28-Nov-23,"Finally, Carol Danvers, Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau reunite for what should be their great adventure together, but it's not far from being just another episode of Marvel to pass the time. It's not really a bad movie, but it does get a little crazy in some situations as Nia DaCosta promised. The action scenes and special effects are always present to offer exciting moments, despite there being some absurd moments. The movie is fun in those aspects, but it still feels like just another superhero movie. Samuel L. Jackson does not disappoint in his role as Nick Fury, although he returns to his role of being just the boss in command who gives the orders and assigns the missions. The three heroines manage to have good chemistry that makes them a good team. Carol Danvers has more personality in this movie, since the first time she appeared in the MCU, she felt somewhat generic. Here she was able to improve with the bonds she forms with her companions, the awareness she gains about her role as Captain Marvel, and the recognition of a mistake she made leading to the events of this film and that Now she must make amends. Kamala Khan is definitely the best of the trio, being very charismatic and cheerful like in Ms. Marvel and it is clear that Iman Vellani proves to be a young actress with a bright future ahead of her. The rest of the characters who could have participated more contribute little and even the villain has an interesting past that could have been explored further. Really, The Marvels is just another Marvel movie that offers a bit of entertainment and does not deserve the rejection it has been receiving even though it is not a masterpiece. It is not even strange that this film is unconvincing for a certain sector and even more so considering that this is the first time that Nia directed a superhero film, which was too big a challenge for someone who is still in his beginnings. In conclusion, The Marvels is just another episode in the world of Marvel like the rest of its installments, but that doesn't mean it's really a bad movie. My final and only valid rating for this film is an 8/10.","

The Marvels," A Marvel Of Action, Comedy, and Fast Pace. Editing Makes This Movie Feel Incomplete
",rgkarim,10-Nov-23,"LIKES:Fast Pace
-This is not some convoluted tale, this is a very big focus on essentially entertainment, action, and fun.-The Marvels puts the petal down to the floor and keeps that pace going to keep your mind entertained with very little downtime.-It amplifies the action, supports the comedy, and keeps the theme of fun without getting too lost in Eternals like drama, which may be a plus for many given some of the dryer pieces on the TV.-Thus, those wanting just that escapism, get this for the most part.Funny, to a Degree:
-The movie tries to be one point back to the 90s feel of the first Captain Marvel, while also trying out some new things that bring Ms. Marvel.-It worked for me. There were some really funny moments that had me in stitches. Primarily Nick Fury and Kamala's parents were the ones making me laugh, but I appreciated the effort and some mix-ups the movie did.-Plus, the writing accomplishes some well-time lines to be entertaining and representative of the characters they built from the previous series.-Plus, for those that love the current trend of stuffing a lot of jokes into a short time, this is a plus and a like for you as well.The Acting:
-Certainly not award winning, ground breaking, or even top caliber for the Marvel Universe, this cast still has some shine to it.-Jackson's role might be sillier and less of the grit and grime I like, but the man's turn of phrase and looks still make me laugh and what he accomplished with this role.-Vellani does her job well as the ever enthusiastic Khan, a fan girl at heart with a lot of that pep and obsession that we see in the comics. She's light, airy, total fangirling, and yet surprisingly deep when she needs to be. Certainly the sore thumb to the rest of the cast's dynamic, she achieves much in bridging a lot of things to come.-Parris' role is much like her Wandavision, feeling one part drama, one part comedy, and one part invigorating. She's got a decent grasp on the character's trauma, and delivers her lines well with fortitude, edge, but yet never going too far. I really liked her chemistry with so many characters.-Larson is intense as ever, really diving into the extremes and keeping that chilling face of stone cold passive force. Yet, the woman did dive into some comedy and I was pleased with some of the things she accomplished in her action hero role. Most notably about the second half of the movie when she hit her stride, this was better for me than her previous roles.The Story Elements, a Little
-The movie has some pockets of character drawing and actual ethical components that strike hard and paint the superhero world again in shades of grey.-Danvers and Rambeau's stories hold a bit more punch, some relevance to me making it surprisingly complex, and giving us that relief from the silly storms of stuttering and speaking that this movie is loaded with.-Khan's story holds touching moments as well, which as a bridge really help add some moral lessons that might go well with an extreme fan to learn.-Surprisingly, even the villain's motifs have some surprises and perhaps the most impressive thing about them, so that's a plus as well.The Mid-Credit Scene
-It's the only scene so you can leave afterwards if you want.-However, it really helps with the excitement factor for many and showing the next steps coming to help straighten out the rumors of the mess that is Marvel.-I won't say more, but this was one of the better end credit scenes that sort of felt like the original three phases.The Action:
-The Marvels' fighting moments finally start feeling like we have someone who understands a superhero movie fighting elements.-There are about three noteworthy fights I will call them, and these held the energy, pizazz, and character that movies like the Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians 1 and 3, and Shang Chi held.-A tad trending into stiff choreography at times, the movie fortunately uses the fast pace to really unload that comic book feel.-Diversity settles in that though there is a common fight element, the scenery and the amount of things happening freshens it up a bit and make it really fun.-And that first battle, was probably the one that showed the most promise and was the peak, though the others aren't bad, but for a few things I'll mention soon.-Overall, this action element was very pleasing to me.DISLIKES:The Villain Is Forgettable:
-I agree with other reviewers I have read, the main antagonist is quite honestly one of the lesser villains I have cared about in a very long time.-Dar-Benn's plot is stronger than her character, lacking any real development, unique aspects, or even those memorable moments outside of some cool fashion, one notable speech, and her piercing eyes.-Her origin story is simplistically boring and lasts less than thirty seconds, and any attempt to connect with her crew or rivalry, shockingly limited and lacking compared to others.-I held no connection or suspenseful purpose to her and felt she was an accessory given everything in this movie. The actress did a fine job, but not even her skills could save her character from the chief flaw of this movie.Too Much Comedy?-It depends on your tolerance and like and style for this to be a dislike.-I love a good comedy that balances and delivers those lines perfectly and has a variety, which this does several times for me.-Yet, the movie is a bit too dependent on the jokes, a lot of banter, nicknames, lines, and an aggressively comedic style that is too much for viewers like me.-Khan's character can be super annoying, and her chatter grates my nerves before they had her try a new approach. While even her parents excessive judgement got a bit looser and haphazard that didn't work for me.-Too many puns, an odd joke with singing feeling out of place, and even some dark comedy that feels out of sorts, the direction for this movie may have needed some fine tuning to match some of my other favorite movies.The Visual Effects:
-At times, they are amazing with what they have come up with to make this comic book come to life with the effects they do.-Plasma bolts pop, punches and walls break, and there is color all around that is super exciting and that dazzle I love for the theater.-And then there are times where the effects look weak, forced, and editing has led to bad blends, stiff movements, and very cheesy looks that mirror a cel-shaded video game.-It's minor dislike at most times, but something I do agree that it's not their cleanest work.The Editing/Adaptations:
-The rumors state there was a lot of editing and I felt I could really see it in this film that hindered more than helped it.-The Marvels has a lot of awkward and unimpressive elements that really tore into the experience they were hinting at in the first set of trailers.-while the edits give you that fast paced, escaping into a lot of fun and comedic moments, it really tore up the story, character involvement, and action in the grand scheme of things.-The origin stories and connecting points are forgettable, blink and you'll miss it moments, lacking that Marvel polish.-Obstacles that start as a set-up of being tough to crack are surprisingly easy to get over, and even the darker morale questions feel tagged on and bland.-One whole segment of the movie on a planet with water felt incredibly rushed, so much depth gone with very obvious transition struggles and an action scene that felt even more rushed than most.-And as for the other action moments, I feel these two lost some edge and suspense, perhaps even style from how much was left out, all too cram so much into this movie that feels like a launch point/wrap up/media launcher.-This dislike I feel is the worst part of this movie, for while it works to keep entertainment, the movie does take some serious hits in a complete story on its own and one that feels every element is needed.-Throw in that I feel Khan's story got chopped up enough, that the Marvels now feels like more Captain Marvel 2 is the better title.The VERDICT
The hate for this movie is a bit stronger than I think needed after seeing the film. While certainly not my favorite to come out of the gate, The Marvels holds a lot more to in terms of fun, fandom, and that entertainment complex than several other MCU adventures have been. I enjoyed the fast pace for the feel and drive, helping keep the comedy good, the plot moving, and the action having that superhero slam that the original phases mostly held for me. It's just a good time, and one that does not rely too much on the proceeding movies to enjoy, so you don't have to wait too much given they fill in the gaps. It's purely going to be mind-numbing entertainment and mostly escapes some of the other themes Marvel got caught up on. Yet, the movie's cuts, while entertaining, really did a number on the movie feeling entirely about the Marvels. Origin stories are highly reduced, impasses are surprisingly easy to get through, lots of shifting around to try to keep all pieces in the movie, an entire section feeling very rushed, and action that feels too short are all things that really feel incomplete to me. A director's cut is certainly needed for fans like me who want all these things extended upon, especially the forgettable villain that has promise, but just gets lost to the comedy and time constraints of this movie. Still, it's not the horrible piece others call it to be for me, but yet feels like there is still some organizational needs to helping get them back on track.My scores are:
Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0
Movie overall: 6.5-7.0.","

The Marvels," A low point for the MCU. An utterly disappointing mess of a movie.
",cedricdumler,23-Nov-23,"I love this franchise to bits so it brings me absolutely no joy to report that this an absolute low point for the MCU and - after 33 movies - the first one that I really have to call bad.The Marvels is so poorly conceived and ineptly executed that it not only makes this the worst movie of the MCU but a contender for the very worst superhero movies of all time. The Marvels does so little right that it's almost shocking to see it make it into theaters in this state and even more shocking to see the ""Marvel Studios"" label up front.Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau and especially Kamala Khan have all been enjoyable characters in their respective movies and TV series. So instead of benefiting from that and offering engaging storytelling, we get dozens of flashes, bangs, utterly bad dialogue, a frustratingly messy script and a mountain of completely soul- and senseless action scenes that bend together as a big chunk of nothingness. It feels like bunch of seven year olds worked with a 270! Million budget. Even weirder is that that The Marvel's is shot by Stephen McQueen's immensely talented cinematographer Sean Bobbitt. So yeah, the movie looks good. It's like a 270! Million dollar glass filled with, yeah you know what.Of the cast, it's only Iman Vellani, as Marvel fangirl turned superhero Kamala Khan, who seems genuinely excited to be in the film. I feel bad for all the great actors in this (especially Sam Jackson, Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris) who tried breathing life into their characters but couldn't change the slightest about the mess they were cramed into.Even cameos from MCU fan-favorites (Hailee and Tessa) and a huge Post-Credit swinger couldn't bring any excitement.Dar-Benn is one of the worst written and acted villains I've ever seen.In no possible universe can Kevin Feige be satisfied with this mess of a movie. You see how much love and passion went into Loki and you see they still know how to do it. The Marvels is the the grand example how to not do it. There's no art pounding heart inside. This does not even feel like a movie but a product. It feels like made and produced by people who have never read a Marvel comic book.The Marvels rightfully becomes the first MCU flop, it will loose the studio around 150 million dollars. A clear sign by the audience: give us quality and we're there. Give as a big pile of trash and we won't show up.NOW is the time to recalibrate. Less is more. Give the projects time. The future will show if this will remain only a chink in the once-impervious armor of the MCU - or if the biggest franchise of all time is about to have it's big downfall.Deadpool 3 has the chance to bring back No Way Home-like quality and with that hype and excitement. I sincerely hope that will be the case.","

The Marvels," Space Balls the ripoff
",bnizcajy,19-Nov-23,"After close to $300M, 4 years, multiple reshoots, the director leaving before the final product was even finished, last minute post credits scene and an 8 hour live cats stream and all they can come up with is ripping off the plot from SPACE BALLS??? It's like they didn't even try this time. How did a civil war equate to the sun dying? Don't know. How are all the people still alive with no sun, air, or water? Don't know. Why it took all that time for Capt. Marvel to figure out she could fix the problem SHE created? Don't know. Why did the Flurkens suddenly start to lay eggs everywhere? Don't know. Why are they surprised this is the largest MCU BOMB of all time? Don't know.","

The Marvels," The Marvels is an overall enjoyable decent movie that can be declared as a good watch and also it has some flaws that makes the movie not that perfect but still it's good.
",raahilkhalifa,17-Feb-24,"Overall I enjoyed the movie and found it a decent watch enjoyable superhero entertainer movie and compared to what the haters and critics were slamming on the movie for no reason. The three main cast of the movie are the highlight and their bonding is superb.I just couldn't take my eyes away from Brie Larson because she looked absolutely beautiful and stunning throughout the movie and her in the princess looks just stole my heart, Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) is by far the best portayed character ever and she does a great job once again doing that character well. Teyonah Parris as Monica Delivers a great performance too and also portays that role well too. The main three cast performance is top notch and so is the rest of the cast. Der Bernn being portayed by Zawe Ashton as the main antagonist of the movie does great by delivering a good performance too. The last action sequence fight by the three main cast joining together was great and was a well choregraphed action sequence which I found good.Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury once again deliveres a great performance too portraying the character very well.Overall The Marvels is a good decent enjoyable movie that may not be too perfect at its best but it's still good.A 7/10 for the movie.","

",Fun1988,09-Nov-23,"It is no mistaking that if you love the blood and guts of action movies this may not be for you. It's a fun, fast paced whirlwind of a great movie. Yes, I said great! Anyone who liked Ms. Marvel will like it. I'm not including spoilers, but I will tell you, That a Barbara Streisand cover of a song is a great surprise! The team-up of Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani is fantastic. They make a great team. You have to admit that Vellani steals every scene she's in! Ofcourse, I would rather see a movie like this than something that has unnecessary gory violence. It is a Sci-fi, comic book adventure and for me it's a winner! ""The Marvels"" is worth seeing!","

The Marvels," Give Ms. Marvel the keys to the MCU already.
",Pjtaylor-96-138044,19-Nov-23,"'The Marvels (2023)' may feel like relatively minor MCU, but it's honestly better than quite a few of Marvel's other recent projects. It's getting a bad rap seemingly because superhero fatigue is settling in, as it's really no worse than (or all that different to) any of the other lesser - yet still enjoyable - entries in its wider series. Its poor box-office performance isn't really anything to do with the movie itself, as the weak marketing campaign has meant that a lot of people just don't seem know it's actually out and those who do would rather catch it on Disney+ when it inevitably drops there in a couple of months. Speaking of the soon-to-be-more-expensive streaming service, the picture does kind of feel like something that ought to have premiered straight on the small screen. It's not that it's bad, but rather that something seems ever-so-slightly off about the whole endeavour. The narrative never quite gels together into something truly cohesive or, indeed, essential. The parts are all there and the A-to-B-to-C of it all lines up perfectly fine, but a lot of it feels like it's retreading old ground and the newer elements don't really get all that much time to shine (for example, some scenes play out like the culminations to character arcs that just aren't in the film). However, despite its legitimate rough patches and a general haziness that gets all the more prevalent in retrospect, the picture is quite a bit of throwaway fun once it gets going. This is mainly thanks to the compelling central concept that sees the three heroes switch places whenever two or more of them try to use their powers at the same time. This leads to a couple of really entertaining action sequences that are impressively choreographed and consistently kinetic, with the first major switching fight being the highlight of the entire affair. The other major reason the piece works as well as it does is Iman Vellani, whose Kamala Kahn is an absolute delight whenever she's on screen. The enthusiasm of the character seems to stem from the genuine enthusiasm of the actor; this energy seeps out of the screen and straight into your heart, putting a smile on your face whenever Ms. Marvel gets a moment in the spotlight. The other two leads, Brie Larson's Captain Marvel and Teyonah Parris' Professor Marvel (?), are both solid as well, don't get me wrong, and the supportive dynamic between the three main characters holds the story aloft even in its weaker moments. The youngest of the trio is clearly the most endearing, though, and I kind of wish the piece had focused more on her as a proper sequel to her series. The villain is very weak and some elements of her plan don't quite line up, but she does what she needs to and acts as a formidable foe for the good guys without threatening to steal a single scene from them. The other side characters, including Kamala's family and Nick Fury, are as enjoyable as they've ever been and raise the quality of what could have been a fairly weak B-plot (as does a certain cat-like creature). Ultimately, this really isn't a bad effort. It's perfectly serviceable popcorn entertainment that's competently constructed from familiar materials (even if it lacks the style of some of director Nia DaCosta's other work). It's as fun as it is forgettable, an enjoyable - if undeniably minor - entry in an ever-expanding cinematic universe. It's pretty good, and it's certainly better than you may expect given its generally poor reception.","

The Marvels," The Flopvels: Hollywood is not making movies for profit anymore. Or for entertainment.
",mgicnick,11-Nov-23,"Here we have not just another financially disastrous so called ""flopbuster"" , but the mother of all MCU flopbusters to date with the movie scoring negative records. Marvel/Disney did it again, they managed to spend too much for an underwhelming final product that would have made sense only as a 30 million production going straight to streaming (in which case I may have awarded a higher score) not as an aspiring blockbuster, which begs the question if they are totally out of touch with reality there at Disney. The Marvels is a watchable movie only to stream while waiting for a pizza delivery or to take the kids to see but not good enough by a long shot to make mature audiences flock to the cinemas to offset the massive production and advertising budget.The movie is trying too hard to be funny and lighthearted while wasting what used to be one of the most iconic Hollywood actors until he started playing such roles, Samuel L. Jackson, who is reprising a mere shadow of ""Nick Fury"" character that use to make billions at the box office not so long ago; now he is an inconsequential minor cheerleader orbiting an incoherent bunch of female spandex-clad superheroes fighting a badly cast, totally unconvincing, instantly forgettable female arch-nemesis. Simplistic shallow story that we've seen many times but done way better, no suspense, disconnected action, characters with the depth of a pothole no one cares to identify with or remember as soon as the movie is over, unnecessary messy CGI, with a badly done touch of sentimentality and feline cuteness, it's not worth the fuss, just wait for it to stream if you really need to watch a pretty average movie.The ""superhero fatigue"" explanation cannot be the deciding factor here when the product is actually bad and not made to appeal to the masses and thus turn a profit.","

The Marvels," A lot of misses with little payoff
",hasanyasinhere,11-Nov-23,"1. The villain is written very poorly and is mostly there because of the plot points which they want to show in the movie instead of the organic growth which you would expect. The villain was very shallow and her acting was very sub-standard compared to Thanos, Ronan, High Evolutionary and even Hela. She laked scene presence and fear factor was lacking.2. Monica Rambeau character is really like a side supporting character whose job is to say the lines so that the conversation can move forward and the audience know that the scene is going to end. In the whole movie she was always coming up with the solution without showing how she figured it out. Maybe these scenes were cut from the final draft.3. Nick Fury is a shadow of himself and is no longer the guy with the plan. Instead he is just there to reassure others and to always tell the stakes and to beg for help. This all makes him like he's not worthy of the status he's been given and is more like a poser.4. The cats subplot and the singing planet subplot was very cringe for most of the fans in my cinema and they could have added some different stories instead which could have showed more engaging dialogues, scheming etc.5. Carol Danvers was better in this one than Captain marvel movie still she is still acting like this lone ranger with so many plot holes in her story which no body knows about like where has she been all these years, Does she have any other friends or any other stories or battles which she was busy with in the past years. She could not show more about her character, her motivation which was a shame. She stills feels alot forced than organic.6. Ms. Marvel was better than her 2 other co stars and did show more of her motivation and character but still at time she was too annoying, behaving like a child without any concerns for the situation that she was in. She should have acted more like how Peter was in Infinity War, like how he was fearful but was trying to act brave for Tony but you could see that he was scared himself and you could see that he wanted leadership from Tony and Dr. Strange and was following along their orders which was much more believable. In The Marvels it was lacking and Ms. Marvel was acting like nothing serious is going on and that everything will be fine and that she's confident.Overall, the movie did not deliver and the overall story is forgetful and very isolated as well.","

",danilmoroz,23-Dec-23,"TL;DR Awful plot, soooo awful role playing. More than that - they even destroyed already existed good characters like Nick Fury: his role here was sooo underwhelming.The plot - they just lost in their own ideas about parallel worlds, universe and space: each movie abandons previous one.Actors - well, just pain to watch. Do not believe at all in their emotions. The whole kid like manner - ugh just so hard to watch.Fights - looks like someone was told to just do what you want. Films of 2000x had much better fight and action scenes.For who this film. Honestly - I don't know. Maybe for 8-10 years old children who are only interested with bright scenes without any plot, without actors doing their job to express their characters. Definitely not for phase 1-3 marvels fans.","

",jfgibson73,29-Dec-23,"It was fine overall. I didn't like anything about the first Captain Marvel movie, so I never expected to even watch this one. Eventually I saw some footage that got me interested, and I ended up liking some parts. I'll agree that the script never should have been approved with such an underwritten villain, and that the story was impossible to care about. The thing that carried it for me was that I was enjoying the three main characters together. Kamala was the key; without her, there was no reason for this movie whatsoever. I hope they can use her in something better eventually. At this point, however, I'll be fine if Marvel just holds off for a while.","

The Marvels," Marvel Misfire: 'The Marvels' Stumbles as MCU's Latest Letdown
",delalicious,18-Nov-23,"""The Marvels,"" the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unfortunately, stands as a disappointing chapter in the franchise's history. Despite the exciting prospect of bringing together characters like Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau, and Kamala Khan, the film struggles to weave their stories into a coherent narrative. The script, attempting to juggle multiple character arcs and connections to the larger MCU, ends up feeling cluttered and rushed. The emotional depth and character development suffer amid a flurry of action sequences that, while visually ambitious, lack substance. The film's use of special effects, especially in key sequences, is notably subpar, detracting from the overall experience. Individual performances from the cast bring some charm, but they're hindered by the disjointed storyline and lackluster dialogue. Ultimately, ""The Marvels"" falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors, offering a forgettable and underwhelming experience. 2/10.","

The Marvels," Despite everything, still fun.
",AfricanBro,10-Nov-23,"I'm a fan of Captain Marvel. Sure, she's overpowered and a bit cocky, but I like her. I was excited but was also equally prepared for ""Ant-Man: Quantumania"" crapfest. The movie has its flaws, but it's undeniably entertaining-I left with a smile on my face. If you watch in a happy mood you'll enjoy it, but if you go in with prejudice or wanting to hate it or be disappointed then you might. Despite its flaws, I won't argue that there aren't any, but I'll disagree with anyone who says it's not fun.So, I can list all the positives about this movie in a single paragraph, and I do have quite a few criticisms that I'll get into later. But, no matter what I end up saying, the movie is just plain fun-it's an enjoyable experience. I wasn't bored or disinterested at any point; I didn't feel the urge to check my phone for messages or anything. I was thoroughly entertained and had a good time. The criticisms only came to mind after a good night's sleep when I had the chance to reflect, but even with all that, I genuinely enjoyed it.Captain Marvel's got cocky attitude, but she's undeniably strong so she backs it up, i mean she went toe to toe with Thanos🤷‍♂️. I also don't think she was as cocky as usual here. Nick Fury's reaction to seeing Ms. Marvel for the first time was just perfect, chefs kiss. It's great to see him back to being the cool and badass character after the disappointing Secret Wars series. The action was cool, with really enjoyable fight sequences, I was hooked throughout. And let's talk about the havoc they wreaked on Kamala's house; it brings home the idea that if superheroes were real, we'd probably hate them, and so would insurance companies lol.I was curious about the vibes it would bring since Ms. Marvel, Captain Marvel, and Monica all bring different auras to the screen. It got me wondering how they would interact, Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel appeared destined to cross paths, and Captain Marvel's connection with her niece, Monica, made sense. It looks like Carol was meant to bridge the gap between Kamala and my Monica, I guess. Iman Vellani's liveliness stole the show.Watching it on IMAX felt pretty epic, felt immersive but I had some issues with the green screen, particularly in the space scenes where the background felt a bit too empty at times. I get that space is vast emptiness, a little more detail could be nice. The graphics were generally good, although there were moments when they fell a bit short.Not a fan of the time jumps. I don't think the recap was necessary, but not everyone watches all the movies and series, so maybe need a little memory jog.I was okay with gender-swapping villain as I'm not a comic book fan. However, Dar-Benn didn't get enough time for proper development; the bare minimum with ""the annihilator"" backstory. It made sense, but we needed more time with her before the events of the movie unfolded. One of my favorite MCU movies is ""Age of Ultron"" because they introduced and defeated Ultron in the same film, and it felt complete story arc. In Dar-Benn's case, it felt rushed, leaving us without the chance to care, fear, or learn about her and her powers-just a brief explanation of her motives.I'm know Captain Marvel is incredibly strong and quick, which is why I like her. I'm a fan of ""overpowered"" superheroes, hence DC characters; but the way she just pops up out of nowhere was insane. Like did you fly here that quick?? And when did she and Tessa Thompson's character become such close friends?? I thought I'd hate the singing planet part, but it wasn't bad; didn't enjoy it, didn't hate it either.I was confused about how they got 'untangled'. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think it was properly explained. It also felt quite unrealistic that, out of everyone in the MCU, only these three characters had light powers. I would have expected more characters to be entangled, but I guess that might have complicated things.It felt longer than it actually was, but in a good way, like the runtime was filled and the movie didn't drag. But it also felt like some parts of the plot were simply missing.There was excessive hugging, i didn't care them by the last two or so. Also they just moved into Monica's house? I really love the credit scene and what it sets up for the future, However people complain movies these days are just set ups for others. I don't think this movie did that too unnaturally. Only the ending.First movie in a while that's made me feel like superhero fatigue may not be a thing, other than GOTG 3. Like Loki s2 is currently making me feel like there's superhero burnout.I believe the chemistry between the characters could have been portrayed better, but I don't necessarily see it as a flaw from this particular movie, more like an issue with the movies/shows that preceded it. As mentioned earlier, the fan-girling between Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel makes sense. But, the connection between Aunt Carol and Monica, despite knowing the backstory, didn't quite hit the emotional chords. That emotional aspect, is what the movie was missing in general.I think with so many movies and shows, plus significant gaps between a movie and its sequel, there's a risk of losing the emotional connection between the two. The time span from ""Captain Marvel"" to ""The Marvels"" is quite extensive. Nowadays, Marvel movies seem more focused on connecting superheroes' stories rather than emphasizing the emotional connections. It's all about how the multiverse links up and how many characters can be packed into a movie to showcase a unified world. It's fun at times but feels unnecessary at others. I don't see it as a flaw specific to ""The Marvels"" movie; it seems more like an overarching issue within the MCU. Reminds me of diseconomies of scale lol. I wonder if Star Wars franchise has the same problems of being too large.Monica feels like a character that should've stayed as a side character, at least for now because it felt like she was promoted too quickly to shared lead roles.I feel like Ms. Marvel was the only character with real depth from having her own series and being more recent. Captain Marvel had a movie, but the issue is that people seem to dislike her because she only appears when needed, kicks ass, and then disappears without much exploration. I'd genuinely love to see more of her and her intergalactic adventures. The movie's villain comes from a 30-year stretch of Captain Marvel's adventures that we never got to see, and it feels like they just threw her in to compensate. Similarly, Captain Marvel's character seems under-explored, and it's disappointing because I wish they delved deeper. I love her, but her depictions have always felt a bit lackluster. It's frustrating that both Captain Marvel and Brie Larson have so much potential but aren't given enough to work with. So I get why people hate her, but I wish marvel did something to change that. This movie helps, but she wasn't the highlight of the film.Ms. Marvel truly carries movie; it felt more like her film than a Captain Marvel sequel. If you liked the Ms. Marvel TV series, this movie brings that same kind of fun to the table. And I'll say it again-I won't believe anyone who claims it's not fun because, despite its flaws, it's undeniably fun. Just being a hater if you don't accept that it's fun at the very least. At the very least.Edit after seeing some reviews: I find that those giving sub 3/10 ratings are a bit excessive- close the extremes of rating either 10/10 or 1/10. I typically reserve such low ratings for movies like ""Cosmic Sin (2021),"" Morgan Freeman's ""Vanquish,"" ""Beast,"" or ""It's a Wonderful Knife""-movies that are genuinely dull and uninspiring lol.","

The Marvels," The most undermined Marvel superhero
",jose-viegas,15-Nov-23,"Unless you have less than 15 years old or have daughters, don't even bother to pay a ticket to watch it. Bad FX, bad script, bad character development and bad story development. It looks like someone asked chatgpt to write a script to introduce the new group of Marvel superheroes using Captain Marvel. 15m into the movie and I still was trying to figure out the plot, the why's... it's really bad. Nick Furry is caricature of what we're used to. Captain Marvel is a joke of what she's capable to do. The cats and the FX are so bad. It's like I was watching a Disney channel kids show. Bad jokes, no emotions, only a teenager who can't stop screaming of excitement . This movie is a joke. Why do they even bother to release it to the theater? I'm sad, because I like Captain Marvel, but it has been undermined since the beginning. The most powerful Marvel superhero is just a joke in this movie as well as everything else.

",nrjiuubzik,23-Dec-23,"It's truly baffling how a project like this managed to secure funding. While watching, I couldn't help but wonder what the thought process was behind the decision-making. The most perplexing aspect has to be the inclusion of a musical number smack in the middle of a superhero movie. This peculiar choice begs the question: Who thought this was a good idea? It's almost as if someone in the production team enthusiastically suggested, ""Let's spice things up with a musical twist in our superhero narrative. The audience will adore the innovation!"" However, it seems that this was a gross miscalculation.The execution of this concept is as bewildering as its inception. The musical interludes feel jarringly out of place, disrupting the flow of the story rather than enhancing it. It's as though two entirely different genres were forcefully merged without considering the tonal dissonance this would create.Furthermore, the overall quality of the film leaves much to be desired. The plot is riddled with cliches and the dialogue often borders on cringe-worthy. It's hard to find a redeeming factor in the midst of such a disjointed narrative.What's even more surprising is the average rating this movie has received. Scoring around five stars seems overly generous for a film that struggles to define its identity. I felt compelled to create an IMDb account solely to express my disappointment and bewilderment at this cinematic endeavor. This movie, in my opinion, is an unfortunate misstep in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of mixing genres without a clear vision or competent execution.","

The Marvels addresses both of these problems. And it works.Are there problems? Of course there are. But it's not all over the place.

Next, plot. Was there one? Did it flow? Did it make sense? NO,NO,NO. I will never attend another superhero film again and will find it quite difficult to attend any film produced by Hollywood since it has been quite awhile since Hollywood has put out anything worth watching.

The Marvels," The Marvelous Ms. Marvel & Proton-- I mean Photon (oh yeah, and Captain Marvel's there too)...
",Chalice_Of_Evil,11-Nov-23,"I was basically given little choice but to see this movie at the theatre due to Disney discontinuing the release of any movies/TV shows on DVD/Blu-ray where I am (not to mention Doctor Who, which they now own, will no longer screen on free-to-air TV for the first time since it began here. Thanks a BUNCH, Disney!). I refuse to basically be bullied into getting Disney+, and consequently have missed out on ALL the Marvel shows. So when the first trailer for this movie made it seem like 'The Ms. Marvel & Photon Movie (guest-starring Captain Marvel)', I wasn't overly enthused since it was Carol/Captain Marvel who I wanted to see more of (after actually having *liked* her first film...'unpopular' as that opinion may be), whereas I knew nothing about these other two.The movie begins with Kree warrior, Dar-Benn (sorry, SUPREMOR Dar-Benn), digging up an all-powerful bangle (someone really needs to round up all these powerful magical items in the universe and hide/destroy them so villains can't keep getting their mitts on them), while the other one is in the possession of Captain Marvel fangirl, Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (just as well I'd at least seen the trailers for her TV show via YouTube and thus was prepared, otherwise I probably would've been wondering WTF was up with the animated daydream sequence). Meanwhile, Carol's living a pretty solitary life in space (with only that scene-stealing Flerken, Goose, as company), though she can at least communicate with Fury. For those who felt Carol was 'too serious'/'lacked personality' previously (give her a break, she had AMNESIA!), she seems to have more life in her now and her dynamic/friendship with Fury remains as entertaining as ever...that is until she sticks her hand in some ""mysterious glowing sh#t"", then he becomes none-too-pleased with her.Though she's not the only one, as Kamala and Monica Rambeau (daughter of Carol's old friend, Maria) make the same mistake, causing all three to unintentionally switch places whenever they use their powers...making for something 'different' with the fight scenes to what we've seen before, as the characters are constantly doing swapsies whilst fighting bad guys, trashing Kamala's house as a result (on the upside, she eventually gets to meet her hero and fangirls out, apologising for the copyright infringement on the Captain Marvel name with her self-appointed 'Ms. Marvel' and determined to give Monica a superhero name too). Once the three 'Marvels' come together, it's fun seeing them interact and the different dynamics they have. There's the uncomfortable tension between Carol and Monica (who's mad at Carol for not being there to support her following the death of her mum, Maria. Um...she was busy SAVING THE UNIVERSE, cut her some slack!), while Kamala learns to tone down her hero-worship of Captain Marvel, after witnessing Carol making the tough decision to abandon some Skrulls (rescuing the ones she can) after Dar-Benn's attack.It's not easy being Carol, who gets blamed for EVERYTHING, is met with suspicion/hostility by Kamala's family (who I understand being concerned for Kamala, given her age/the fact she's involved in stuff that could get her KILLED, but they seem fine with Monica, whilst resenting Carol, and they wear a bit thin after a while), and although Carol's the one to defeat Dar-Benn, it's Monica who gets the 'big hero moment' at the end, closing the hole to another reality that Dar-Benn ripped in space. It almost feels like Monica's the lead, while Carol's just there to support her. Eventually Monica learns the real reason Carol wasn't around (after destroying the Supreme Intelligence, which had unintended consequences that led to Dar-Benn's planet dying and now she's stealing resources from other planets to save hers, Carol felt too ashamed to return) and forgives her 'aunt'. Still, the last scene of the movie (mid-credits) is all about Monica reuniting with her mum from the other reality she gets trapped in (Kelsey Grammer also makes a cameo as Beast, looking better/more Beast-like than he did in his previous appearances) and so this Captain Marvel sequel's ending isn't even *about* Captain Marvel.I waited around for a post-credits scene, but was just met with a blank screen and what sounded like a Flerken barfing up something. Speaking of, Goose once again proves to be the TRUE hero by hatching a litter of Flerken kittens whose ability to swallow not just objects, but people as well (whilst keeping them ALIVE), proves crucial...though too bad this wasn't thought of when the Skrulls needed rescuing. As previously mentioned, Brie Larson's much more 'livelier' in her performance this go-around (though she also gets some decent emotional/dramatic moments), this was my introduction to both Teyonah Parris's Monica (who spent the majority of her time spouting technobabble/science gibberish and I wasn't that fussed on until after she forgave Carol, then she got more likeable) and Iman Vellani's Kamala (who's entertaining, even if she overdoes the screaming/""Oh my God!"" exclamations a bit...though at least it's warranted when she sees what Goose can do for the first time) and I appreciated the montage of the trio teaching themselves how to work with the whole swapping-places-whilst-using-their-powers thing.Zawe Ashton as Dar-Benn (who's much more fetching than her Smurf predecessor) did what she could playing yet another MCU villain who's doing BAD things for what is, in their mind, 'the right reasons', but when the 'Marvels' show her mercy/try to do her a solid, she threatens Kamala's life, then goes all kamikaze (what is it with Accusers exploding? First Ronan, now her...find another way to die!). It's a shame that test audiences apparently didn't respond well to an extended sequence on a planet populated by people who communicate through song (I imagine it got trimmed), as it was actually one of the movie's more memorable/fun scenes. I personally feel the OTT hate for this film is unwarranted, as it actually wasn't as bad as I'd feared (and with a ringing endorsement like THAT, how can you *not* want to watch it?).","

The Marvels," What a disappointment
",RichardSRussell-1,11-Nov-23,"Boy, I really wanted to like The Marvels, which opened yesterday. But I didn't. It was chaotic, jumbled, and arbitrary; assumed way more knowledge of backstory than reasonable; tried too hard for unearned sentiment; and featured a wooden performance from nominal star Brie Larson. It was not redeemed by its one brilliant touch, the use of the song ""Memory"" during the main hypercat scenes.I know that superhero stories are nominally science fiction, because they're supposed to portray things that could really happen in the real world, without use of magic or divinity, if we're willing to grant them a couple of wild cards, such as the assumption that we've been able to figure out faster-than-light travel. And I'm OK with a COUPLE. Anything more than that, and we're dealing with fantasy. This one was way too fantastic. And I don't mean that in a good way.","

They have to give you an early recap of Ms Marvel's Disney+ show because apparently, no one watched it and would even understand her character. The entire premise of this between the motivations of the big bad, to the power swaps, is preposterous. This seems as if it's a sequel to some movie that doesn't exist.Brie Larson plays the role like an A. I. trying to portray emotions. She found a way to be less enjoyable in this follow-up than Captain Marvel. Monica Rambo's hero name, be it Quasar or Photon most likely, still hasn't officially been named.The actress that plays Ms Marvel is likeable, but more suited for television as opposed to big budget movies like this. There are times the action sequences start off okay just to he derailed by a slapped on poor effect or strange directorial choice.This movie may be worse than the abomination that was The Eternals and may be the nail in the coffin for Disney Marvel.1 star over minimum for a few cool special effects and the Ms Marvel actress seeming to enjoy playing her character.","

At that point my expectations of ""The Marvels"" dropped through the floor.Not surprisingly The Marvels did not exceed my expectations expectations - the movie was predictably monotonous and with the Ms Marvel character in the movie as well .... It will certainly be one of the worst movies I will see in 2023 and certainly the worst Marvel movie that I have ever seen.","

Maybe it's simply cos I came in to the film with incredibly low expectations or not I don't know, but it was a short, fun adventure movie, the three leads played well off eachother, with Iman Vellani standing out and carrying most of the movie in my opinion. It also surprised me in that it made me like Monica Rambeau a bit more than I did in Wandavision, which I didn't expect.Don't get me wrong, that's all I can really think to say in a positive way about the movie, and be aware before watching - this film is not anything special.Is it the saviour of the MCU? No,
Does Nick Fury's character seem to have any after effects from the secret invasion show? No?Does it explain how Monica can breath in outerspace without a spacesuit? No.Are her superpowers explained at all? No.Does Brie Larson make Captain Marvel any more likeable? Not really.Can you name the villain in the film without googling it after watching the film? Nope.I could go on with this, but it's more fun if you make your own list!

And when he was asked ""what is the reason of this party and who are going to come?"" and he replied, ""no reason, and nobody!"" Now back to the movie business, when there is no script or story line, what is the reason for the big budget and preparation? This Marvels is just satire of Captain Marvel. Just a quick look at its cheap comedy. And just imagine there are dancing and singing in the Marvel Universe.in the scene of cats I would not be surprised if I see Garfield in that between.","

The Marvels," A fun adventure filled with intoxicating and delirious energy !... And with some pretty sweet emotional bits.
",valmont1702,08-Nov-23,"This Marvel production is eclectic and pretty atypical, so it for sure is gonna unsettle a lot of people. But to me, it takes the cake with this will to lead the story in a nice variety of directions while pulsating with a powerful colorful energy ! It has lots of funny moments as well as a few emotional ones (that help cimenting the vibrant connection between the characters)... It's served with several cool scenes and visuals, creative fights and action, heartwarming dialogs, with also a few very serious or high stakes type of moments as well as a few quirky bits (that are for sure gonna bother certain viewers, such as some of my friends btw).Overall a pretty unique vibe, it is an entertaining ride that doesn't shy from going in diverse creative places. It's high in colors, with an intense energy that doesn't weaken from beginning to end (the last 15-20 minutes focusing more on emotion), and the last few scenes introduce some great stuffs in a very cool way.The power of unity and pure friendship always succeeds !A Marvel movie that has heart, that's for sure.","

The Marvels," Fun and campy with a lot of entertainment.
",cruise01,11-Nov-23,"5 out of 5 stars.The Marvels is an awesome superhero film that is fun and entertaining sequel that delivers. Ms. Marvel, Monica, and Captain Marvel are an entertaining and fun trio that has there powers connected which they will have to work together to face against a bad guy who is trying to destroy other worlds to save her own.The film has plenty of humor and fun. Especially involving the flerkin alien cats. Ms Marvel is a huge improvement from the cheesy series that came out. The film has plenty of exciting action sequences. The story is great. The cast ensemble is fun. The set pieces are colorful. The villain was decent but the actress playing the villain was great.The visual effects are bright and colorful. The direction was fast paced and moved at a kinetic speed with action and story. The film does have a mid credit scene that's important and hinting towards the next direction mcu is heading. It is a lot of fun and action packed.","

The Marvels," good movie, lame plot
",rich-12169,14-Feb-24,"So I was actually quite entertained throughout most of the movie. Enthralled even. Sure the plot doesnt make much sense, has no reasons for things to happen, but the things that do happen are at least interesting and fun to watch.The montage where they are learning how to control their body switching powers was both lame and cool. Lame that all they did was jump roping with them. But cool in how seamless they were able to master these powers.. Unfortunately...lol, they never use these powers to their advantage. They dont use them in any cool way while fighting or in the end when one of the characters sacrifices herself. Which was a big let down.But overall i surprisingly enjoyed it, all the characters, and the teenage ms marvel.What makes no sense was the dying planet, The ease at which they were able to restore the sun, and brie larsons massive change in bra sizes. Im a guy..Was i not supposed to notice?","

The Marvels," Mass production MARVEL
",ItsRobinTV,08-Nov-23,"Mass producing machine MARVEL produced another superhero movie, but the funny thing is: to completely understand this movie, to know and understand each character and culture that appears in this movie, you need to watch 8 other movies and 4 series' - yes I counted it - and I didn't count the movies you need to watch first to understand the movies you need to watch to understand this movie, which would probably double the amount. Well this gets a bit complicated. Marvel movies were all connected since the beginning which is the reason so many loved Marvel, yet they have pushed this concept too far. But what do I really think about this movie?Many movies including this one, Fast X or the upcoming Aquaman 2, have the same antagonist motivation: Revenge. It's BORING Marvel, it's BORING Universal, it's BORING DC/WB. However, they somehow still don't get it.On the other hand, The Marvels is a true masterpiece in terms of fun and cuteness. To see Gosse eating people or Kamala Kahn being a fan girl just warms up my heart. Additionally, it seems like Marvel gave the VFX artists some space to breath because the VFX aren't that bad. Oh and Samuel L Jackson is a scene steeler as always, just a pleasure to see him.If you have accepted the current quality of superhero movies, you can definitely enjoy this The Marvels and even if you don't, the movie only goes 105 minutes, so a pretty great deal right?","

The Marvels," Intergalactic Superhero Switch
",MiroslavKyuranov,08-Nov-23,"The strongest part of the movie is the chemistry between the three lead actresses, with Iman Velani (Kamala Khan) certainly being the best of the three. You're just seeing a real childish reaction that most likely anyone would have if something like this happened to them. I would compare it to Peter Parker in ""Captain America: Civil War"". Carol is cool, but she should have been more than that. Monica had the potential to be developed as a much more important character after ""WandaVision"", and here she felt a bit like a ""third wheel"". Fury and Kamala's family are very good supporting characters and funny ones at that. I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh with them, but speaking of laughs, the other strength of the movie is precisely that it's funny. If you're looking for something to let loose without straining too much, the movie is perfect, if you're looking for something more, watch some other MCU movie. There are also silly moments, some will like it, others won't, not others will like it anyway.The villain is forgettable and exactly 1 day after the movie, no one will remember her name, if anyone knew it before. It's Dar-Benn. Apart from being the budget Ronan, it doesn't leave you anything else. I don't think the problem is with the actress so much as with what she was given as a script.The story and overall the whole scenario is nothing special. The premise is interesting, but it feels like we're watching ""Captain Marvel 3"" before we've seen ""Captain Marvel 2."" Some important things have happened that we only mention and spend about two minutes on. Definitely some 15-20 minutes would be useful at the expense of 10 minutes on a planet that communicates by singing. Not that I particularly minded it, but how should I put it...priorities?The effects are ""questionable"", in some places they were good, in others they needed more finishing touches. The best fight choreography of the film was at the very beginning. The final battle was okay, but the truth is, it's not something that will go down in MCU history as some great moment. I'll give an example, if I tell someone ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", absolutely everyone thinks of the fight between Steve and Bucky on the road with the knife that fell between their hands while they were fighting and it's a practical fight, without the need for many effects . Just great choreography. There was no such thing in ""The Marvels"".The main musical score was nice.The final scene of the movie, as well as the credit scene, will actually ignite more discussions than the film itself. Both are important as they tease things that are becoming more and more important in the current phase of the Marvel universe.Clearly, the pandemic negatively affected this movie as well, but in a different reality, if ""WandaVision"" and ""Ms. Marvel"" had came out within one calendar year and ""The Marvels"" had come out at the beginning of the next, 2020 vs. 2021 respectively, the movie would have excite more people to watch it. If you haven't seen the Disney+ shows, you will understand the movie, but if you have, you will be pleasantly rewarded by understanding more things.In general, I can sum up ""The Marvels"" as a fun little quest in the MCU that beats a few important events, brings together three closely related characters and leads us to something much more interesting than the movie we just saw. Top 10 MCU Movie? Not a chance. The weakest MCU movie? I would not say.","

When Carol, Monica & Kamala switch places whenever they use their powers, they have to join forces to save the universe, from the villainous Dar-Benn(Zawe Ashton).The Marvels is a marvelous film. Director Nia DaCosta has given us a movie that is downright hilarious most of the time & yet has its poignant moments. It's definitely not one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best. However, it's in the top twenty & doesn't deserve some of the harsh reviews coming its way. The action set pieces are mind-blowing & look even better in IMAX 3D. The visual effects are brilliant. Brie Larson is outstanding as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Teyonah Parris is phenomenal as Monica Rambeau. Iman Vellani is spectacular as Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel. The effortless camaraderie among Larson, Parris & Vellani's characters, is the highlight of the film. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Nick Fury. Zawe Ashton is good as Dar-Benn. Zenobia Shroff, Mohan Kapur & Saagar Shaikh are amazing as Muneeba Khan, Yusuf Khan & Aamir Khan, respectively. The supporting cast is unforgettable.

There is no humanity behind her acting. The other characters were poor caricatures of what real people are like. Perhaps that was for comedic effect, but it failed if it was.The action was tame, the script was embarrassing, and the effects were second rate.I have to assume Jackson needs the money to appear in something as bad as this.This was a pointless movie that just confirms that the MCU universe is devoid of interest and originality.","

The Marvels," Kamala and Cats steal the movie, cling film thin plot
",blackbird1048,11-Nov-23,"Even compared to the latest series of marvel movies, this film's plot is paper thin. Body switching, revenge villain. All have been done countless times before and far better than this.If you havent seen the Ms Marvel TV show then the slap stick and comedy Kamala family issues that cloud over many scenes are highly annoying and will throw you off. The cast of that show are back and just as silly as they are through out that show. It even goes into the semi obligatory training montage part way through.Like many others out there I had no expectations of anything of quality from Marvel. Yet I was disappointed with how thin this was. Typical Hollywood has to have a Brit as the villain. Zawe Ashton does what she can with the material she's given. She gives a far superior performance with it than Larson bothers with hers.The cats chasing the crew around the station to ""Memory"" from ""Cats"" is the best scene in the whole film which is sad given the end of the universe plot. Then again both DC and Marvel seem to forget their source content material when it comes to making films. How bad would ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Saw"" be if it was a PG-13 movie? Yet what does DC attempt to do, when all their material including the action sections is that dark? Marvel strips out that dark level drama out of their material to make their movies so they end up hollow.","

It appears that her new powers connect her to ""Danvers"" (Brie Larson) and her slightly estranged cohort ""Rambeau"" (Teyonah Parris). When they use their powers they find themselves transported into each other's shoes - causing mayhem all over the place, especially at the family home of the rookie superhero who is as yet unaware of just quite how powerful her shiny amulet is. ""Dar-Benn"" is out for revenge. After ""Danvers"" destroyed the AI that controlled their planet, it has gone into terminal decay and so she decides to reinstate her world by stealing the atmosphere from one world, then the water from another - where they only speak in song, so perhaps no great loss - before deciding to borrow the sun from Earth to reinvigorate their own failing star. With a little help from ""Nick Fury"" (Samuel L. Jackson) the three have to galvanise their powers and focus on thwarting this dastardly design before it's too late. Now there is nothing even remotely original in this. It's all join the dots Marvel adventure with the usual pyrotechnics, spectacular visual effects and thinnest of stories. The denouement is never in doubt and actually feels rather rushed after a first half hour of repetitive combat scenes that don't draw breath but don't really entertain either. Larson is a natural actor (she reminds me a lot of Grace Kelly) but nobody here really has much by way of dialogue to work with as we see this film manoeuvred into the path of another franchise that it would appear destined to join with next time. Barbra Streisand makes a surprise (vocal) appearance during quite an innovative scene herding cats and simultaneously saving people, but I found the rest of this to be same old, same old and though shorter than we are used to, it's still all a bit old hat. Looks good, but I doubt that you'll never remember it.","

",cricketbat,09-Nov-23,"The Marvels begins with an interesting idea: what if superheroes switched places every time they used their powers? But that concept never seems to reach its full potential, as it's merely a minor inconvenience for the characters. This movie also suffers because the muddled plot is so entangled with other MCU shows. You'll need to watch at least Captain Marvel, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel to fully understand what's going on. Also, since Kamala Kahn is practically the only character with charisma, the movie relies on her a little too much. I enjoyed parts of The Marvels, but not the movie as a whole.","

The Marvels," Probably the worst Marvel movie ever made
",niallh-66092,11-Nov-23,"I have no idea what happened to this franchise. To think this is the same studio that brought us Iron Man, Avengers and Infinity War.The story of the Marvels is an absolute mess. Its all based around a body swapping mechanic triggered by using their powers, which seemed more like an idea included just for the action scenes. They then proceed to forget about it whenever they need them to use their powers but its inconvenient for them to swap. They also never explain why they started swapping places in the first place. Even when the effect wears off they have no idea why or how it happened, and they dont try to explain anything more about it then either. Its just dropped for the rest of the film as if it never happened.The villain could have also been the worst Marvel villain we've ever had. Her acting was absolutely terrible. I genuinely laughed out loud on multiple occasions. She had paper thin motivation, no character traits whatsoever and looked ridiculous doing anything in her costume. She also has Ronins hammer for some reason and its left completely unexplained and ignored. Seems like that happened with a lot of things though, no doubt a side effect from the ridiculous amount of reshoots they've done.The 3 lead actors do a fairly decent job with the material theyre given. However there is only so much you can do. Carol is slightly more likeable than she was in the first film (which wasnt very much) but she still isnt given much in the way of character development. Monica is also there, but also doesnt get much to do. Oh ye and she learns to fly because Nick Fury shouts ""black girl magic"" at her (im not even kidding). She can also pass through solid objects, shoot laser beams from her hands and can close tears in space time apparently.The best part of the film by far is Ms. Marvel. The actress is likeable, she tells the only jokes that land in the film and she has some nice moments with family members. But they are way too few and far between, scattered between random action, painfully boring villain dialogue, nonsense filler in the form of a musical planet (dont even ask), and a side story near the end about a bunch of cats that can teleport people to other dimensions. Because what everyone wanted more of after seeing captain marvel was cats.This is a terrible mess, which is not surprising after all the studio meddling. If you care about good storytelling, good characters or even the MCU in general, I'd stay away from this one. Though I find myself saying that more and more these days.","

Carol's past failure comes back to haunt her and the group has to save various worlds.This latest MCU movie suffers from a sickness that has plagued the franchise recently. In general terms, it's doing too much. It's always trying to move the franchise plotline along and advance whatever phase we're at. I wrote this about Secret Invasion, but I've been feeling this for awhile. Watching the MCU has become more an obligation than a joy. As a completist, I'm just checking the boxes.First, the start of this is a test of my memory. I don't remember all of Captain Marvel. So I don't remember if she destroyed the Supreme Intelligence in that first movie. That should be the sequel. She battles the Supreme Intelligence and the situation turns into crap. It's the darker sequel to set up a brighter conclusion in a trilogy. Instead, the whole story is jammed into a montage. The first act of this movie is giving me a headache. I don't remember everything. I don't even want to think about people who haven't seen the TV shows.Second, it's the whole sucking up all the air premise. I laughed and said out loud, ""That's Spaceballs"". Granted, it's less silly than Spaceballs, but the premise is still the same. Somebody at Marvel had to have made the same connection. It's not a big leap.Third, it's the switching. It's a good gimmick for the first fight. By the last fight, I'm tired of the chaotic action. It's more chaotic than the usual chaotic MCU climatic fights. It's tiring and it's boring.I do like some aspects of this film. I like the team. I like Carol's dark secret. I like the musical world idea although if the MCU wants to do a musical, the whole film should be a musical. And get better songs. At the end of the day, there has been worst MCU films, but this is latest bad MCU film.","

",darren_bass,15-Jan-24,"How the mighty have fallen. When Marvel first introduced Iron Man to the big screen and gave birth to the MCU it was obvious to all us nerds that we were watching a product made by people like us for us. For 23 movies Marvel gave us a cohesive, coherent, fun and exciting universe that culminated in a two part Avengers story that had us laughing, cheering and crying together in theatres. Sure not all the movies were great but even the bad ones added to the overall lore being built. But alas like all good things in Hollywood the MCU has now been co-opted by corporate interests and we are now getting sub par (at best) drivel that is more about ticking boxes and selling Disney+ subscriptions than it is about telling good stories.Which brings us to The Marvels which is as bland, boring and soulless as you can get from a big budget superhero movie. Sure it looks good and the cast give it their best but nothing can paper over the cracks of what is a shockingly bad script, story and direction. The main villain is so completely forgettable that even while watching the movie I had no idea what her name was (I still don't) and at no point during the (mercifully) short run time were there ever any stakes. When the movie descended into a ridiculous Disney musical around the halfway mark I totally checked out. This movie is horrible to the point where I'm not sure I can take this universe seriously anymore. After movies like The Eternals, Thor Love and Thunder, Quantumania and shows like She-hulk, Secret Invasion and Echo it's obvious that Marvel is no longer trying to produce quality products. It's a shame to see the death of the MCU but all good things must come to an end. Sadly unless someone can rescue Marvel from Disney there is no coming back from this mire of mediocrity.","

The Marvels," Skip this one
",melindabesker,23-Jan-24,"Complete disappointment and disaster of a movie. First, when I saw the cartoon part and the beginning it was a sing do not watch. But, as a big fan of Marvel, I've decided to give it a chance. That was a second mistake. Movie is made for children with ,for me, no connection to what Marvel is supposed to be. Acting average, except for Samuel F. Jackson how did good as it gets. Introducingto many new characters confuses viewer( especially one who is fan of Avengers, Iron man, Hulk, Captain America, Spiderman) who is customed to old characters or at least mian character. Story is interrupted with switching stories between characters. Definitely expected more for Marvel. RIP Stan Lee.","

",rocker_21,14-Nov-23,"I can't blame actors because they are doing what they have told to do. I blame Disney execs, director, and writers for such fiasco. Since Disney bought Marvel, this franchise have lost their north.If I would like to see a musical, I choose any Princess movie. Why????? Why a musical part in this movie??? Why???? Doesn't make any sense at all!!!!! Why Nick Fury is making stupid jokes like Thor in Love and Thunder????? Why the movie should be childish instead of teaching Ms. Marvel the dangers that will be facing for real in outer space??? ""The bad girl"" inspired no fear at all and she had poor dialog like the rest of the cast.Don't waste money or time or even data.","

",VickySoprano42Q-VLT,21-Jan-24,"I recently watched ""The Marvels"" and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed with the movie. Not only was it unorganized, jumping back and forth between different timelines, but the acting was subpar.Imani Khaliani, a person with no acting background, was a poor choice for a lead role and it showed in her performance. It is unfair that thousands of talented acting students put in time and effort, yet someone with no experience is chosen.The plot was confusing and hard to follow, making it difficult to fully enjoy the film. Overall, ""The Marvels"" was a disappointment and I would not recommend it.","

The Marvels," Funny sequel but Badly Written movie
",timeblank,11-Nov-23,"The villain and Captain Marvel backstory is totally missing from the whole story of this movie. The plot doesn't even make sense and I don't understand how the hammer weapon is powered without the infinity stone. Monica Rambeau is she even supposed to be a hero? What type of Captain Marvel name is she supposed be? Iman Vellami is a superior character throughout the movie. She mostly stole the show. The movie displays four different scenes but the execution is just a total mess. We have cats that vacuum people up, a singing village, and the skrulls. Their were a few cameos which was impressive but I don't see how it applies with the MCU. Funnier sequel but badly written.","

The Marvels," Oh no!
",Lewis_Heather787,12-Nov-23,"With all the negative reviews surrounding this project, it actually made me want to see how bad it could be. Or I'd either be in for a nice surprise and the critics were wrong. (this is rare territory for Disney and Marvel to have such a polarising film even before its released).I'll be honest my expectations were low and yep this film is pretty terrible! I have only one/two good things to say about the film. Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson are of course still trying to save this film and I do feel sorry for them, that they are in this horrendous product. I'll be honest I actually was in the minority and really really enjoyed ""Captain Marvel"". Still to this day I stand behind that statement and view, I do think its very good. I'm also in the extreme minority who actually don't get the hate for Brie Larson, she is a perfectly fine actress and does well in the role.Her performance along with Jackson's might be the only two things of any note that are half decent.The rest of it is a mix of boring, bland story telling along with some mindnumpingly stupid decisions taken with this film. I am still in shock how they thought turning it into a musical for a brief time would be a good idea? Like what had the writers and director been sniffing to come up with that?? I want it permanently erased from my memory!The villain.........erm I have no idea where to begin with that......erm weak doesn't feel good enough descriptor but I can't think of anything else. Its sad and shocking this was the best they could come up with.Forgettable story, villain, tbh the whole film is extremely forgettable and stupid.I'll leave it at that because I really don't like writing negative reviews. We have to remember there are hundreds of people behind the scenes of films that do work very hard to produce something good, its not always the case that it comes out well.20% out of 100 its terrible, you can watch it and laugh or cover your eyes in horror.PS - Forgot one minor sort of good thing, the cat eating the crew gag, made me slightly laugh! I know shocker, however I'm biased because I like cats. Oh and also, wow X-Men tease at the end, like we really needed that?","

The Marvels," One of the Best Post-Endgame MCU Films
",barrycaceres,14-Feb-24,"I fully enjoyed The Marvels and I have no idea why it got so much hate. Ms. Marvel definitely stole the show. It is definitely a bright spot in Phase 5. Quantumania was just ""OK"" but The Marvels was fun with so much more witty banter and chemistry between the heroes. Ironically, for all the fun the previous Ant Man movies were, it surprised me how The Marvels beat Quantumania in that department (anybody seen Luis?).After enduring Marvel's Phase 4 with the surprising train wreck that was ""Thor: Love & Thunder"" (especially after ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was so brilliant) and the horrible ""Eternals"", it was nice seeing a Marvel movie that was fun and exciting and where the heroes were engaging and had chemistry together. Especially enjoyed seeing Nick Fury again in a good story since ""Secret Invasion"" disappointed so badly.I will agree with most people that Marvel Phase 5 has been awful, but I feel like The Marvels just got hate because it was surrounded by so many other bad projects (similar to how ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" suffered from following ""The Last Jedi""). This MCU installment made me smile and kept the action flowing and had solid character growth for the heroes. The vibe I got from Ms. Marvel was very similar to watching Tom Holland's Spider-Man -- just enjoyable.Obviously, The Marvels was no ""Iron Man"", ""Avengers"", ""Civil War"", ""Infinity War"" or ""End Game"", but it is definitely in the top half of MCU movies for me. I would definitely enjoy re-watching The Marvels more than watching ""Thor: The Dark World"" or ""Iron Man 3"" or even ""Doctor Strange"" -- and ""The Mavels"" definitely surpasses its predecessor ""Captain Marvel"".I am hoping ""Captain America: Brave New World"" is good but I have low exceptions for ""Thunderbolts"". But I fear that both films may disappoint.","

Storywise They could add this story as maybe 3 more episodes to Mrs Marvel instead of making a movie of it.Hate to say it but seeing Brie Larson act is a pain for the eyes, everytime just big eyes and an awkward facial expression, like she didn't know what to say or how to act. People are right to say that Marvel is in a downward spiral, no descent storywriting. Everything after ""Endgame"" is bad, like Marvel doesn't know how to move on. It's repeating past stories.","

But movies of late are definately written in a bitter state. I wonder what else is in store. I miss the good old days of MCU, but not this kind of garbage. This movie has to be the in one of the worst written movie. Only advantage is that the length of the movie is short. So i can skip everything in 15 minutes. This movies does not add anything.

The Marvels," Surprisingly good enough
",xqbvmzqzd,08-Feb-24,"Three superheroes switching places when we using their powers is at least somewhat original as opposed to the usual good team vs bad team, or villain vs hero trope. Yes, is does have some forced jokes and a few minutes of musical in it, but overall it's nowhere near as bad as expected. Also, they are not Mary sues because all three have a history of fighting and are seen training together. That's more work than Luke Skywalker did in Empire strikes back. The story itself is a bit weak but a lot better than ""villain wants to conquer because reasons"". Basically captain marvel ruined a planet and the villain wants to fix everything at the cost of others. Don't expect anything like avengers infinity war, but this is a nice try at originality. I could rewatch, but not too soon.","

The Marvels," Bland, lazy, and uninspired...The Marvels is anything but marvelous, not even as a marvelous disaster.
",Darwinskid,10-Feb-24,"The Marvels is exactly the sort of movie that critics and trolls would dismiss the output of Marvel Studios back when the Marvel Cinematic Universe was in its second and third phases - shallow, childish nonsense with empty spectacle. The actors and director try but ultimately the story is too undercooked with not enough heart and soul put into it, and it rushes everything that there is just not enough time to properly invest into the characters.Since the terrible box office run, I have come across many attempts to defend this motion picture, and I have also seen some people try to justify their argument that the reason why its performance was terrible was a result of an atypical situation. Each and every one I must say has not been either compelling or sound in logic, so to save a reader the trouble, I am going to list the most common ones you may run into, and my reactions towards them.""It's not a perfect movie."" Well, no movie is. Even the top 10 movies of the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 list have technical and continuity errors listed for them, so while one can argue they are perfect in various ways, evidently they are not in all ways. Statements of this sort are just empty ones if we're being honest, because it admits that there are issues within the picture that cannot be completely defended and spun around to appear of great quality.""I didn't hate it."" Well, aren't you being kind. Here's a newsflash for you though, you are not supposed to hate it. 99% of films are designed with the intention that the audience will come away liking the picture, even if the filmmakers did not set out to entertain or excite the viewer with spectacle and pretty colors. The people who constructed this very movie were hoping to draw enough favorability from the general population to bring in amazing profit. These statements are neither a compliment or a very good endorsement if you ask most people.""It's just a fun movie, do not overthink it!"" This argument would probably work if the film was not built on the foundation of a cinematic universe that has been up and running since 2008, which has a history of producing content regarded as some of the best in superhero cinema in particular and blockbuster filmmaking in general. A silly, no-brainer yarn is a step-back for Marvel Studios after all they have accomplished in the past, and they shouldn't settle for it, either. Furthermore, the movie asks a lot from the viewer, if you did not see either WandaVision or Ms. Marvel on Disney+ you will be very lost, but to make matters worse there is a lot of plot mumbo jumbo that is introduced in the film that is too shy in detail that you feel another movie or series is missing for better context. The plot is just not as simple as it wishes to present itself as, and rather than coming across as complex, it is coming across as complicated nonsense.""People who didn't like it are allergic to having fun at the movies!"" This is such a strawman argument. Sometimes the problem lies with the filmmaking itself than of the individual, who may (for all you know) have come in wanting to very much enjoy it.""It bombed at the box office because society rejects female led movies."" Yet the very same year, Barbie a major box office success. The original Captain Marvel picture also performed good in theaters in 2019. Other female led films and television series also have performed well, why this movie underperformed is the same reason why many male led films underperformed - lack of interest and lack of faith in the product.""It bombed at the box office because of the strikes."" Yet Barbie and other movies released in the year did fine despite of the strikes.""Just you wait, in a few years it will be regarded as the Blade Runner for a new generation."" I genuinely question if the people making this argument have even seen at least one version of Blade Runner or really understand why it went from a box office failure to an acclaimed work of science fiction filmmaking.Such a disappointment, I was hoping Marvel Studios would aim higher for a follow-up to Captain Marvel, I liked the Ms. Marvel series quite a bit, and while I had issues with WandaVision I did think Teyonah Parris was quite good as Monica Rambeau and thought the conflict between her and Carol Danvers could have played out very interestingly on screen, but it is dealt with fairly quickly.The worst Marvel Studios has made to date? No, but it is not far from holding the title.",NA

It was confusing the way it was handled in the first half, with the explanation of the loose threads poorly delivered by the actors. Save your money.

The Marvels," It was bad but had some fun moments...
",JTReviewsPlus,11-Nov-23,"Despite the mostly negative reactions to The Marvels and some surprisingly high praise from a few media outlets I did my best to go into the theater with an open-mind. I always go into a movie hoping for the best especially when it comes to all things superheroes but unfortunately The Marvels is bad movie. Is it the worst MCU entry? I actually don't think it is despite the buzz and lack of interest in this film. Let me explain why.The 3 main leads were actually fun to watch on-screen. I know a lot of people don't like Brie Larson but I think she's a great actress and a good Captain Marvel but the writing and lack of direction fails her yet again. She delivers emotion during times that require it but you don't feel the weight of it due to poor setup and lack of time to develop anything. This is the shortest MCU movie to date the lack of runtime is extremely noticeable.Iman Vellani was a standout as well pouring her love for the character on-screen with an infectiously positive performance. Teyonah Parris was also great as Monica Rambeau once again but like Brie Larson she was given little to do in the movie.There were even a decent amount of well choreographed action sequences but all that does not make up for zero character development, low stakes, directionless plot, terrible villain, bad VFX, cringe side objectives and so much more. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling anything but despite my complaints there is still SOME enjoyment to be had (even if some of it is unintentional laughter from how bad it is at times).","

The Marvels," Marvel-Less
",danchilton-71955,11-Dec-23,"The Marvels marks the first time people who don't keep up with the deluge of Marvel TV shows will feel properly out of the loop. More worrying it feels more like one of the shows than a tent pole movie.The plot follows Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers, Miss Marvel/Kamala Kahn and Monica Rambo as they try to stop new leader of the Kree Empire, Dar-Benn from destroying various planets to fix her own. The McGuffin trinket that allows the villain to do this also leads to the three heroes switching location whenever they use their powers, forcing them to stay together and work as a team.The dynamics of the group are fun with Ms Marvel actress Iman Vellani easily the best thing about the film. Hopefully she stays on the big screen going forward and isn't wasted in more Disney + mediocrity. Brie Larson does her best as Captain Marvel but the ""I tried to help but it didn't work out"" colonial guilt storyline doesn't really work on a character you are trying to portray as an out and out hero. Teyonah Parris' has the least to do as Monica Rambo and often feels as if she is just there to make up the numbers.The Marvel, like much of the MCU, works best in its light hearted moments. Sam Jackson once again decides Nick Fury is going to be a completely different character and is consistently funny. Anytime him or Kamala Kahn's non plussed family are on screen is a good time. There is also a fun section on a planet where the inhabitants only understand words when they are sung although it all gets a lot more generic once the fighting starts.That really is the story of The Marvels, any creativity is buried under a tonne of MCUness. Director Nia DaCosta has said its more a Kevin Feige movie than hers and it really shows. From the focus on TV characters to the limited story it feels like a movie made to fill a hole in the schedule. Antagonist Dar-Benn is a prime contender for most forgettable Marvel villain and let's be honest, there is some stiff competition for that role. Again actress Zawe Ashton does her best but a wannabe Khaleese who speaks like she has too many teeth and reuses a weapon an already pretty boring villain previously wielded isn't enough to create a compelling threat. It was always going to be hard to create a decent bad guy with three leads and a side plot vying for screen time in a 90 odd minute movie. I'm sure it's just a coincidence that it took a female ensemble outing for Marvel to suddenly remember you can edit a movie to under two hours.There is also an inherent problem with having these three characters team up. It works great from a character point of view but requires the audience to turn a blind eye to story consistency in order for the three to be considered somewhat equals. Captain Marvel flew across the galaxy in minutes and overpowered Thanos but hereshe struggles in scraps with a couple of goons. She is also seems no more effective at fighting the main villain than the other two leads who really aren't in her weight class. It's mentioned at one point that she has the power to restart a sun so why is she struggling to dispatch this B-Tech Ronin the Accuser?The brief running time and humorous moments mean The Marvels isn't an avoid at all costs proposition but it adds to the sense the MCU in general is becoming a bit of a pointless time sink. Less Marvellous and more less Marvel please.5 planets that haven't had their atmosphere sucked out of them out of 10.","

The Marvels," Not that Good [6/10]
",panagiotis1993,28-Jan-24,"My Live Reaction / Review for The Marvels (2023). So the main villain finds a device the same as Ms Marvel? I hope they explain how. It looks like Captain Marvel is killing people, maybe she does it off screen lol. Does Captain Marvel take this cat everywhere she goes? That' s dumb. These are some of the most boring fight scenes ever. I don't get why they keep changing places every time they use their powers. The explanation doesn't do much to explain what is going on. Just some mumbo jumbo. Also who decides where they appear when the change happens?More awkward and boring fight scenes, yay. Captain Marvel destroyed a planet? Doenst sounds like a hero. All the characters are annoying but I think Ms. Marvel is the most likeable one. More mumbo about space and stuff. A planet of people that only dance and sing but don't talk? That's ridiculous. At least they can fight. Some cool fight scenes. So the villain wants earth's sun? Sounds dumb. So now Captain Marvel will have to recharge the Hala's sun? How? Im so tired of the science mumbo jumbo in this movie. The second half of the movie is better but still is a mediocre movie overall.In the end they talk about forming a new team with young superheroes, sounds like a nightmare. Overall this movie wasnt that good, my rating is 6/10.","

The Marvels," A fun time at the movies don't let hate persuade you into seeing if
",tytebben,11-Nov-23,"I personally don't under the hate this movie is getting
It's a fun time at the movies and a decent film
While it's not a super amazing movie it's also not a horrible movie but a solid movie and around the B+ area
It does set up the future which I'm excited for
It didn't go overboard with cameos but I wasn't expecting to see valkery or Kate bishop and freaking Beast I did love the movie and same with quqntinamauw I pretty much love everything from the MCU and ignore all the hate projects are getting.See it for the fun and enjoyment of it
The khan family is charming as ever I really loved them in Ms marvel
I'll admit the villan is a little boring but there are villains worse then her
Malakith Ronan the guy from the first Captain marvel
To name a few
Marvel isn't dead and the future looks LIGHT - pun intended (all 3 have light based powers$
And while next year there'll only be one movie and I think like 2 or 3 shows
With the strikes at an end the studios will be able to focus on good vfx and will not be rushed
This is a good decision made by marvel

The Marvels," worst MCU bomb since 2008
",iamjamalwhite,13-Nov-23,"There is a reason nobody is seeing this trash. It is ""Barbie"" in a super suit. The opening weekend was a disaster with less ticket sales than any MCU movie since ""The Hulk"" 15 years ago. It is running 6/10 on this page and 44% on Rotten Tomatoes. I saw it with a few buddies at a matinee on Saturday and we were alone in a big theater. The movie starts out with some action and a foreshadowing statement by Nick Fury ""I jsut need you for one more mission"" to Capt Marvel. Does that mean the end of Brie in this role? We can only hope. There is a black superhero that we met in ""Wanda Vision"" but have no idea what her powers are yet. There is a little girl who just got her powers but fills the ""asian"" block and she is a teenager so there is that cute ""first kiss is awesome"" crowd. They bring in a Korean prince for no reason at all. The second act drags and the final act is a let down. But the hidden scene will be the reason most come to see the movie. It does not disappoint. That three minutes are the best of the 90 spent wading through this poopy diaper of a movie. Cannot stress enough - just awful.","

The Marvels," Tamer Version of Ragnarok
",Ltufano23,13-Nov-23,"Following up 3 Disney+ shows and at least 1 film, The Marvels feels more like the experimental team-up films of Phase 2, rather than the cookie-cutter, disconnected nature of Phase 5. Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris create a wonderfully charming team, as you can truly feel the friendship growing throughout the film. While Brie Larson is always captivating, Iman Vellani steals the show every moment she is on screen. Her performance as Kamala Khan is consistently charismatic, comedically well timed, and delightfully quotable. Unfortunately, the villainous Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) was underutilized and the short runtime felt like it should've stretched to give her more character building. The supporting cast all compliment the story well, with Nick Fury (Sam L. Jackson) and the Khan family having fun with their side plot. While the film is full of exciting moments, I wish they had fully committed to the wacky elements, as this feels similar to Ragnarok, but it stayed too tame to really blow you away. For the most part, the visual effects look appealing and it isn't until the mid-credits scene that things start to look rushed and rubbery. Though I would have loved to see them play more with the interesting additions brought into the MCU, The Marvels is a very charming and captivating ride, akin to films like Ragnarok or Guardians,","

The Marvels," Marvel better at TV now??? Loki=Amazing, Marvels=Horrible
",djbamford,14-Nov-23,"As a decades long Marvel fan I hate admitting it, but this may have been the nail in the coffin for them, at least for making movies. Me and several friends just finished Loki and were all amazed on how well done it was and agreed it's among the top 5 cinematics Marvel has ever released. We hoped Marvels was going to continue that experience and connect those awesome plot lines, but it failed on every level. We almost walked out less than halfway through because of how bad it actually was. Don't understand why they dumbed it down so much, and desperately used cats and musicals to try to connect to teens. They ruined a great opportunity for a timeless memorable movie with an all female cast of heros, and instead doomed them to be a part of history when Marvel officially lost its way. Heartbreaking, and unfortunately made me and many real fans lose hope for the next few movies and the MCU as a whole...","

",collinsjamesjc,17-Jan-24,"By far the worst film MARVEL have made. They've fallen so far from Endgame.Captain Marvel is one of my favourite characters and after seeing only 15 minutes of this film I had to turn it off.The story is all over the place, it's near impossible to follow and you don't know what is going on!The CGI is very questionable...it either looks like a computer game or just CGI from the 80s (which may be better than this)
The acting from the supporting cast is terrible aswell, there doesn't seem to be no chemistry with the actors and it shows.I turned the film off after 15 minutes because it's just unwatchable if you're a marvel fan, this film should be the end of Marvel movies (for a while at least) until they get the mojo back.","

",alpkaiser-26559,26-Nov-23,"Although the movie put a lot of effort in trying to find a north and be good, it fails miserably pushing to a confusing plot where a lot of details are left behind. The impression I had was that there were much more to be explained and they could have used more time to connect all the dots.Talking about ""connect the dots"" this is exactly what Disney/Marvel are trying with their ""expanded universe"", but this is exactly where they are also failing. A movie should be complete on its own. I shouldn't be required to watch other movies or pay for a streaming (which I don't pay for a long time now) and watch a number of other TV Shows to understand the entire universe or all the references.Don't get me wrong, what Marvel did on MCU phase 1 (and slightly on Phase 2) worked. Everything was connected. However you could watch every movie independently and it was fine. MCU is going downhill for a while now and the car has no break anymore.","

The Marvels," Another failure from Marvel.
",glori1491,16-Dec-23,"Actually, in recent years Marvel has not managed to raise the level of its films again, because despite always adding comedy to them, they did have good stories, characters with whom one clicked. Yes, I understand that they have been putting together the universe for so many years that it can be difficult to put everything together without losing the thread, as well as for the viewer himself (one no longer remembers certain stories or where certain characters came from). This film feels like just another filler, like all the last ones they have made, despite having been able to make a film with a strong theme of feminism, sisterhood and the role of the female superhero, it was quite the opposite, Marvel has become expert in doing post-credit scenes but that ends up tiring to the viewer that the only good thing about the film is a post-credit scene, it's like a way of saying put up with all the bad things to see a few good seconds. The worst scenes were those made in Aladna, it seemed like a bad comedy movie or those movies where they make fun of other movie clichés. The villain was forgettable, like Carol defeated Thanos but couldn't handle that kind of villain alone. Despite Nick Fury leaving, they didn't make it. Even though Kamala is a teenager and one knows that she is the typical fan girl in this movie, they went overboard showing her as a stupid woman. I didn't see them making any connection to Loki or Secret Invasion. Actually, I still watch Marvel movies because I am a big fan of superheroes, but they are getting tiring. My hope remains that I can make a good multiverse, the entry of the X Men and the young Avengers.","

The Marvels," From Glory to Devastation: The demolition of the MCU continues.
",abnidaala,14-Nov-23,"""The Marvels,"" the latest addition to the MCU lineup, disappointingly falls short of its predecessors' standard. Plagued by discontinuity and a lackluster script, the film fails to provide meaningful character development or compelling backstories. It regrettably echoes recent trends in mainstream Bollywood cinema, where quality storytelling has given way to formulaic production. The film's approach to introducing new female characters feels forced and underdeveloped, undermining the potential for genuine empowerment. This superficial treatment not only detracts from the movie's appeal but also provokes frustration rather than admiration for these characters. Overall, ""The Marvels"" is a missed opportunity in a franchise known for its dynamic and thoughtful storytelling.","

But I didn't hate the first captain Marvel, and saw that they were at least trying to do something fun with this one. Unfortunately though it really is just another ok superhero movie.There's another stock alien with a hammer who's motive i can't even remember, and its up to our trio of forgettable heroes to save the day with some lackluster CGI. One of them is of course an annoying child sidekick upgraded to a main character, and you'll be confused at times if you haven't seen every other Marvel movie (and tv show so far).But its not a total disaster. There is some decent action and the characters switching their powers around at least adds a little something different. Even if there are a couple even more out there ideas in the movie that force it more and more down to a below average score.","

Positive thing is that this movie is relatively short, so people don't have to suffer for a long time. In general Marvel went from hero to zero after Phase 3 and unfortunately there are no signs of recovery.It is like Marko Dinjar directed this movie. For those who don't know who Marko Dinjar is: he is by far the worst football (soccer) coach in the history of the game. Believe me he is really bad, just like this movie.","

",neil-476,17-Nov-23,"A rather aggressive Kree lady finds a bangle which we, the audience, recognise as the twin of the one which gives Kamala Khan her Ms Marvel powers (if you haven't seen the TV series, this becomes clear later on). The Kree lady immediately embarks on assorted cosmically destructive shenanigans: a side effect is that using their powers results in Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel), Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel), and Monica Rambeau (...uh... Monica Rambeau) to change places. Things need sorting out.This movie has come in for a lot of criticism as well as poor box office (so far). I am happy to go against the prevailing school of thought and say that I absolutely loved it. I sat there with a huge goofy smile on my 71 year old white non-denominational male face throughout its running time, and loved every second.The spacefaring stuff is adequate, the reappearance and plot relevance of Goose the Flerken is fine, and it's good to see Kamala's family cameo, and nicely in character. For those who love continuity and interconnectivity, there are good doses of that too. Yes, there is stuff which allows nitpickers to nitpick, and for those looking to find fault, you will.But the heart of this film is the developing relationship between the three main characters: Carol Danvers' ongoing struggle to recover what the Kree stole from her and the consequences of her promise to take down the Kree High Intelligence, Kamala Khan's hero worship for Captain Marvel, and Monica's deep hurt that her Auntie Carol broke her promise to be right back notwithstanding the Blip and Marie Rambeau's death. There is some genuine heart here.The fight scenes with the three changing places are amazingly choreographed and managed SFX-wise.The mid-credits scene - well, don't miss it!","

The Marvels," The MEHvels...
",paul_haakonsen,09-Dec-23,"I have to admit that I was in no particular hurry to get to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""The Marvels"", as I have steadily grown weary of the Marvel movies. Sure, the Marvel movies makes for fair enough entertainment, given their effects and such, but there are just too many of them, and they sort of seem like a dime a dozen.The storyline in ""The Marvels"" was a bit cluttered and somewhat of a struggle to really grasp and understand what writers Nia DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik really were trying to convey here with the script and storyline. Sure, it was watchable, but it was mostly because of the constant non-stop action and the special effects. And there was a bit too much comedy throughout the course of the movie, which made the movie feel unnecessary goofy.The villain in the movie, Dar-Benn (played by Zawe Ashton), felt like a rather irrelevant and pointless antagonist, as she seemed to have very little motivation or cause for her villainous acts. Was there something to her storyline prior to what transpired in ""The Marvels"" that would have done the character more justice?The acting performances in ""The Marvels"" was good, and leading actresses Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani certainly carried the movie quite nicely.I have to mention the song and dance scene in ""The Marvels"", because it was especially rough and horrible to sit through. It felt so out of place and out of tune with the entire overall feel of the movie. It is so cringeworthy that it has to be seen in order to be believed how toe-curling bad it was.There was a lot of action in ""The Marvels"", and I mean a lot! It was almost a non-stop action fest from start to end, and while it definitely was an upscaled speed that the movie went forward in, it was somewhat on the cost of a profound and compelling storyline. The action were overshadowing the narrative in the movie, truth be told.Visually then ""The Marvels"" is good. Of course it is, as it is a Marvel Studios movie. And that is something that holds true for all of the Marvel movies, the CGI effects are quite amazing. And let's just be honest, it is the effects that serve as the deal-sweetener when you sit down to watch these copy/paste movies.My rating of ""The Marvels"", from director Nia DaCosta, lands on a five out of ten stars.","

Other than that, this is a complete disaster from start to finish. Including a drink and popcorn, this cost me nearly $30 that I could have put to many other good uses (just giving $30 to the first person I saw on the street would have been a better use).

The Marvels," I enjoyed it. A shame many people are determined not to.
",gcsman,17-Nov-23,"For this movie the TFR (troll-free rating) is 7/10, which you can see if you look at the bar graph of the viewers' ratings. I think that's about right and that's what I give it personally. It's bright and lively and brings back lots of characters from recent MCU outings, including the first Captain Marvel movie but also WandaVision and Ms Marvel, which are pretty much essential to understanding the backstory for all of them -- otherwise what's going on will seem a bit confusing. And it's always nice to see Nick Fury again, and Kamala Khan's family too.The lead roles played by Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, are all fine and much of their on-screen time is spent getting to know each other (in rather different ways than three guys would do, which I appreciated). If action is what you go to see though, there's plenty of it too. If anything it's just a bit too short overall, the scene-to-scene transitions can be a bit abrupt and I would have liked some smoother continuity with more time to dig beyond surface interactions. A couple of sections (the one on the water planet whose name I forget, and the later one with all the Flerken kitties) veer off into crazyland territory, but they're still fun. Add in Zawe Ashton's role as Dar-Benn, and all four of the lead roles are women. About time.Based on their reactions, it looks like a lot of 'fans' just want Avengers Endgame types of films all the time. But that stage of the MCU movies is gone, and it's not coming back. Not all superhero offerings have to be Major Events. We're more into the era of ""ordinary superhero"" movies now that aren't all tentpoles, and I don't mind that we're getting a variety of approaches and styles from different directors and studios. The Marvels fits into that category. Just go and have fun! Enjoy it for what it is.","

The Marvels," Could have been great if there was actually PLOT!
",MovieWarfare,21-Jan-24,"I found the first Captain Marvel movie to be relatively enjoyable. I had a lot of gripes with it but it was okay for the most part. However, Marvel Studios has been in a sort of downward spiral since Endgame so my hopes weren't high for this. So is this a Marvellous entry or another to add to Marvel's recent dumpster?One of the big issues in the first Captain Marvel was how incredibly stoic and bland Captain Marvel was. There was nothing emotionally engaging about her character. The sequel does improve upon this aspect by making her less stoic. She has more of an emotional and some actual proper reaction to things occurring. She also shows a fair amount of emotionally vulnerable moments, especially concerning her relationship with Monica and her mother, Rambeau. There are 2 strong scenes with her. One is a flashback and another where she is opening up is something I wish the film had more of.A key element of this movie is that if Captain Marvel or Monica or Ms Marvel use their powers at the same time then they will swap places. The first act of this movie is very entertaining because of this. There is a great action set piece in the first act where all 3 end up fighting in different locations but keep swapping during it. The biggest highlight of this film is Iman Vellani as Ms Marvel. She is extremely likeable and her performance is wonderful. She is enjoying every moment in every scene and it feels like the actor is having fun. It also has a kind of cool mid-credit scene.Unfortunately, this is where the praises end. The plot is incredibly paper-thin. The hero has to stop the villain, that is it. There are no layers or depth to anything in the plot or proper character development or arcs. The plot is so bland that the movie adds a pointless side quest that adds almost nothing to the main narrative. We have a planet where everyone sings and it is as stupid as it sounds. It happens and it is just so out of left field. It's not funny, if anything it is very cringy. I hoped that they would at least do something special with the singing planet, maybe they would fight by singing or have special singing weapons or something. However, they just fight normally, so what was the point? There is also a side plot with the Flerken, the alien cats, that comes out of the left field and is a pointless distraction that has nothing to do with the villain.On that note, the villain Dar-Benn might be the worst villain in the MCU. She is the new leader of the Kree as her planet was put into chaos due to Captain Marvel destroying the Supreme Intelligence. This could have been an interesting element as from her perspective, Captain Marvel is the villain that destroyed her planet. If they showed more of her struggles at being a leader, how terrible the planet has become and how she is genuinely doing this at the goodness of her heart for her home, she might have been interesting. Sadly this is not the case, despite having a sympathetic motive, she is just overly aggressive to everyone, including her allies. She is a one-dimensional villain who never becomes much of a real character with any depth. She is also somehow able to fight all 3 protagonists and has a hammer-like Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy despite having no Power stone which is never explained.My biggest disappointment is Monica's, Ms Marvel and Nick Fury's role in this movie. Monica doesn't do much at all apart from spouting exposition and being a MacGuffin. Her now sour relationship with Captain Marvel is only touched upon a bit and barely explored. She just ends up following Captain Marvel for the whole movie and doing some things near the end. This is also the same for Ms Marvel who is also very underwritten. Her being a big fangirl of Captain Marvel is the only reason she is here. She has no character arc or development. This is a shame as she could have been used in more effective ways. She could have been the contrast to Captain Marvel. A naive, idealistic hero vs a battered and burnt-out hero. Ms Marvel could help Captain Marvel to lighten up and be more hopeful again while she learns how it isn't all fun and games and there are a lot of responsibilities with being a hero. Unfortunately, she is just comic relief and that is it. Nick Fury is just kind of there. The movie is just very tonally inconsistent. We can go from a quite moving scene to something so incredibly dumb and stupid within minutes.Overall, what an absolute shame this movie ended up being. It is so gut-wrenching to see what MCU has become since Endgame. All the heart and effort put into their films are nowhere to be seen any more. I do have a small glimmer of hope that they are going to do better in 2024 onwards. They only have 1 MCU movie in 2024 which is making me hopeful that they are slowing down and putting effort into their future project. If Captain Marvel 3 even happens, I hope they write a plot this time.","

The Marvels," Definitely the worst Marvel movie.
",kccord-57303,19-Jan-24,"Marvel movies are getting worse and worse. I'm a superhero Marvel and DC fan. But I have to say, why? Who thought this movie was necessary? I liked the Captain Marvel. It wasn't the best but watchable. But this? What can I say that hasn't been said already. This should have been a Nickelodeon movie. Kids would like this. But not a feature movie. The writing was bad. Action so, so. If you haven't seen Ms Marvel or Secret Invasion you will be lost. The jumping from one scene to the other was horrible. It's almost as if the studio had some extra money and threw this together to spend it. 4 of us watched it and we all said 20 minutes into it, this is bad.","

The Marvels," Marvel keeps forgetting the seriousness in their world ending movies and replacing them with funny contents...
",Ruben17,09-Nov-23,"First off all I went to see this one without any expectations cause I had no idea what was coming cause I've only seen one trailer and they showed a lot of OG Avengers flashbacks and after seeing this I'm still clueless on why they did that tbh...
Yet Kamala Khan delivers throughout this movie but the rest is disappointing... It feels like Brie Larson didn't wanna be there and the villain is just there cause they needed one i guess.Marvel keeps forgetting the seriousness in their world ending movies and replacing them with funny contents not sure why they keep doing that but it's a buzz kill!The plot holes were bigger than the Universal Neural Teleportation Network (or jump points) they used and the humor was more cringe than anything else... Except for Kamala's connection and heartwarming bond with her family they built that up really nicely in her show and this movie!A few great IMAX shot's in space tho and most of the visuals were nice and well done.","

",fanchnou,08-Jan-24,"This review title makes as much sense as the movie itself. I was hoping for a good old Marvel movie flair, instead I found a new era Disney style movie for kiddos blended with teen's video gamers'style all over the place fights scenes; which makes as much sense as a Cinderella meets Star War crossover.I didn't recognise the traditional and genuine Marvel's touch at any point during the movie. Either it's a big fail or Marvel has decided to take a whole new road aiming only at kids and teens, thus making the movie ""End game"" an end game for the generations who loved the first phases. I wonder how it will affect the new X-Men since they popped in during the end credits.","

And don't forget that mentioning conveniences would be very obvious.Looking for the good side of the film, the visual effects were not disastrous as in Quantumania, we do not have the absurdly ridiculous humor of Love and Thunder and we have continuity to insert at least two more franchises.

The Marvels," This Is Not A Terrible Film. Its Just Not Very Good One.
",dtswpod,16-Nov-23,"The hate directed toward this film is absurd. An honest viewer can't possibly believe this is the worst film ever made or even a terrible comic book movie. Or the worst Marvel movie ever made. Folks need to get grip.To be clear, I didn't think this was a good film. The vi8llain is a bore and the plot, at least in regards to the reason our heroes need to come to the rescue, is just not that compelling. It also doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.However, you don't go to films like this for coherence you go for the fun and this picture just isn't fun enough. The three leads are all fine and some of the jokes are bangers but that just isn't enough to raise this above a simple okay.I believe there is a very funny off the hook picture in here and I wish Marvel had been able to find it.","

The Marvels," Worst Casting and Worst Movie of Marvel
",nfake-65215,11-Nov-23,"First of all as a person who is from Asian Continent and a Indian. The character of Kamala Khan is so exeggrative that it's not even feel like asian. Nia who is the director doesn't even read comics is directing this film.. It's ruining the legacy that was built the hard work that was done by the actors, writers, directors.. This movie with goofy dialouges.Editing Woes:
One of the glaring issues with ""The Marvels"" is its lackluster editing. Scenes feel disjointed, and transitions are often jarring, leaving the audience struggling to follow the narrative. The pacing is inconsistent, robbing the film of the seamless flow that is crucial for an engaging superhero movie.Goofy Dialogues:
The dialogue in ""The Marvels"" is another major letdown. Instead of the sharp, witty exchanges we've come to expect from Marvel films, the lines often come across as forced and cringe-worthy. The humor feels forced, and the attempts at banter fall flat. It's as if the writers were trying too hard to replicate the success of previous Marvel movies, resulting in a script that lacks the authenticity and charm we've grown accustomed to.Character Development:
Beyond the technical aspects, ""The Marvels"" also disappoints in terms of character development. The lack of depth in character arcs leaves the audience emotionally disconnected from the protagonists. While Marvel films have excelled in crafting compelling characters with relatable struggles, this installment seems to prioritize spectacle over substance.","

The Series Silda agents were a top series in the first season, and then changed the topic and stupid humor, the spirit of the series completely destroyed.He would very much like that series never recorded again.So, the same can be applied to this film.The humor in this film is so stupid, boring and transparent, that since the beginning, this film presents as a boring and irritating show.Nor is it that funny, nor the actions make sense, and that meaningless humor and meaningless actions is full film.I don't really believe that the level of teenagers is as low as the film producers imagined, if they take care of it more.Also, the introduction of musicals in films that still carry the glory of the first films about the avengers, is a complete debacle.It simply became a habit of moving from Marvel's workshop more and more like the movie's comedian-type movies, however far that it was expected.Damage to thrown money and spent time.","

I appreciated the portrayal of Carol Danvers as a more expressive and even awkward character, likening her to a Disney Princess. I also found the Kree's perspective on Captain Marvel as a unintentional villain intriguing, though I wished the film explored this aspect further, drawing a parallel to ""Civil War.""The primary weakness, according to I, was the underdeveloped villain Dar-Benn, serving mainly as a catalyst for broader plot elements like the introduction of a parallel universe (X-Men films) and the formation of the Young Avengers. I highlighted unexpected cameos, including Valkyrie, Kate Bishop, and Hank McCoy, expressing relief at a clearer direction for the MCU after a somewhat meandering Phase 4.In conclusion, I credited ""The Marvels"" with reinvigorating the MCU, providing hope for a more focused and exciting future for fans.","

It still somehow manages to have an incoherent plot.Kamala Khan/Ms Marvel (Iman Vellani) gets zapped out off her New Jersey home to find herself somewhere in space. While Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) finds herself staring at Kamala Khan's puzzled parents.Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) whose mother was a close friend of Carol Danvers.

Is it on a par with Endgame, far from it.Is it is bad as Thor love and thunder, well hell no it's not.I think it could have done being another 20 minutes longer, which could have been used to flesh out some of the characters, the main villain in the movie could have benefitted from that, you are sort of just expected to dislike her from the get go, but no explanation why you are supposed to dislike her. This did come later in the movie, but it sort of give her some form of justication for being a bit of a git.It was a good, funny movie probably on par with the first AntMan or Doctor Strange, in case anyone was wondering, I have added an extra point for the post credit scene, the only thing I will say about it is that it's not to be missed and will possibly and hopefully change the MCU forever.It's the thing marvel fans have been waiting for since the Fox purchase, if you know then you know, and if you don't know then strap yourself in for the ride, it's going to be a good one.","

Instead of being exhilarating, it was exhausting.The actors who played Kamala's family are fine actors but they felt too Indian rather than Pakistani. Mind you they might look similar but there's still a big difference in two cultures. Secondly, that cartoon sequence gave me the vibe of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" and not fun to watch (sorry).The movie should've started with a brief but subtle recap of what happened in the TV shows, then slowly picking up the pace.All three ladies were great. I see Iman has a great timing for comedy and have a good future ahead.

The Marvels," MCU Nuggets, Not Much Else
",TMAuthor23,20-Nov-23,"Ask yourself this: would Meryl Streep make a good super hero? Or Robert Deniro? The argument here is that even in the hands of an Oscar winner, a comic book hero demands a very tricky performance to succeed. Too serious, you get The Green Lantern. Too goofy, you get Howard The Duck. Even Oscar winning directors (The Eternals) can fail to understand the balance between drama and spandex jammies.The movie does little to build on Captain Marvel's exploits. Instead, in its short running time it focused on developing the relationship with the other two leads, Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan. The central theme revolves around an alien (Kree) civil war and a new rip in dimensional space. What ensues is a mishmash of plot points involving the three leads attempting to seal the rip in time space, and untangling their powers, while the alien war creates multiple issues within the movie and the broader MCU. We get more info on the SWORD organization and the SABER space station in an already crowded acronym landscape.It's confusing, to say the least. Other than small roles (Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury as one example) by capable actors, Larson is the lone acting presence required to do lots of heavy lifting; but she struggles to bring any sympathetic beats in her performance, opting for a stoic and stiff presentation. It's all too serious and too self involved to care much. And Khan's juvenile approach feels better suited to her Disney+ TV series, which is intended for a younger audience.The potential tie in to other films may interest die hard fans, but all in all the film fails to entertain and provide anything new. This is a recurring trend in recent MCU movies, that all appear burdened with connecting the dots between earlier films and the many marvel tv shows Disney continues to pump out. This is unfortunate. For every WandaVision we get a SheHulk or the DOA Secret Invasion.And it's not just Marvel that's suffering this treatment. For every season one of The Mandalorian, or Andor, we get a Boba Fett or an Ahsoka. So Star Wars gets ill served by the Disney studio too.Not recommended.","

We lasted 3 or 4 minutes into the film and upt and left!What killed it so quickly for us?Cue the stupid, cheap looking cartoon animation sequence which straight away, raised the eyebrows, cue lots of staring at each other (And NOT the screen : take note Marvel) and wondering if we were watching a pre school TV show!It didn't help that we knew nothing about the character sat on the bed (found out later she was introduced on Disney+) and the cartoon sequence being unwatchable, though ""apparently"", was a quick rush about her origin and zzzzz.....Didn't get any further than that as we'd left the movie theatre (thank god we were seated by the exit!)Sorry but Marvel really screwed up on this one which is one of the main reasons this film has bombed at the cinema!New characters introductions and story arc should ALWAYS be done through the movie first, then flesh them out via streaming series NOT the other way round!Phase 4 is becoming a convulted mess because of this and the movies and overall quality are suffering.Keep the movie stories streamlined and interconnected but PLEASE, any series should be a side arc which doesn't interfere or is required viewing to understand the film.How this got past pre-screening in its present form is beyond me & even more concerning is how it managed to get green lit for release by so many studio execs?? Did they want it to fail!?!?Another film I may get round to watching in full at some point in the future. What Marvel/Disney should be more concerned about is my reluctance to part with more cash on future movies if this is how they intend to move forward.2 stars for the opening space sequence and I feel that's being very generous.","

The Marvels," Kamala is the best part of this movie.
",mtl_freak,16-Jan-24,"Kamala makes for the best part of this movie.This whole mess could be avoided if the involved parties would just speak to echother. It seems it was no big deal for Miss Mavel to kick start the sun.And what happened with the air and the water... did they just get to keep that?It's not the worst movie ever made I'm sure. But It's a long time since I've seen anything this messy and incoherent.This was the first Marvel product I've seen in a long time except for Guardians 3.That was not too bad a watch.I was really glad when they started making these types of movies, and they became better and better as they built up a sturdy universe of characters.Now everything seem so rushed and shallow.(Even for a superhero movie this is shallow)But hey... there are other films out there luckily.Props to the actress playing Kamala.The cats was at times funny.And some of the fight choreography was really good.Peace!","

The Marvels," A Quantum of Solace, Marvel Style
",natmavila,09-Feb-24,"Let's cut to the chase: ""The Marvels"" (2023) somehow manages to be the cinematic equivalent of that one friend who insists on explaining the intricacies of their incredibly detailed dream - it's fascinating, sure, but you can't help but occasionally glance at your watch. The plot whirlwinds through cosmic conundrums with Carol Danvers leading the charge against the Supreme Intelligence, sparking a Kree civil war that leaves their planet Hala gasping for... well, everything. Enter Dar-Benn with her fancy Quantum Band, ripping open jump points like they're discount coupons for interstellar travel. The ripple effects mess with Earth's S. A. B. E. R. Station, sending our heroes on a light-powered pinball adventure across the universe. It's as chaotic as it sounds, teetering on the edge of being a galaxy-brained masterpiece and a celestial soap opera.The heart of the movie beats within its quantum entangled trio: Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala Khan, who find themselves in a cosmic game of musical chairs, swapping places across the cosmos faster than you can say ""quantum leap."" It's an inventive twist, leveraging their light-based powers in a manner that's both visually stunning and narratively dizzying. Watching Kamala's family home turn into a battleground for Kree enemies is like observing someone throw a house party while their parents are out, only for the Avengers to crash it - amusing yet anxiety-inducing. The film's middle act, set against the backdrop of Skrull refugee crises and peace treaties, almost hits the mark with its political undertones, if only it didn't feel like we were sprinting through a ""Cosmic Conflicts for Dummies"" guidebook.In the grand scheme of the universe, ""The Marvels"" orbits successfully around the entertainment galaxy but struggles with its gravitational pull towards coherence. The climax, featuring Dar-Benn's apocalyptic aqua-heist and solar snatch-and-grab, spirals into a spectacle that's both eye-popping and mildly exasperating. The resolution, a mix of heroism and quantum physics homework, leaves us pondering the elasticity of comic book science. Kamala's journey to forming a new team sparkles with potential, teasing future adventures that hopefully balance heart, humor, and heroics more evenly. As for the mid-credits scene, it's a Marvel staple, serving as both a tantalizing teaser and a reminder that in this cinematic universe, the end is never truly the end.So, is ""The Marvels"" worth the intergalactic ride? Absolutely - if your idea of a good time involves deciphering quantum physics while watching superheroes redecorate the universe. It's a three-star spectacle that shines brightly but occasionally gets lost in its own astronomical ambitions.","

The Marvels," Marvellous entertainment and a very fun movie
",namob-43673,08-Nov-23,"This movie has everything going against it. Strikes, unknown director, superhero fatigue, and perhaps most notably is the MCUs track record lately which has been abysmal.But oh my lord this is so much fun watch.There are 3 negatives: I can think of is that it is too short. This movie flies by with stunning entertainment from first second to last, and the ""short"" run-time makes it fly by even faster. The second negative is that this feels a bit too goofy and too Marvel at times. The first Movie was much better, and felt more original, and more true to the character of Captain Marvel. The third negative is a few misses in the dialogue, but I also think that goes together with the short run time.The good with this movie is basically everything else. The directing (which I was very hesitant about) was good, the acting one of the best in any Marvel production, the music and sound design is masterful, and the entertainment goes through the roof into the stratosphere. Perhaps the most entertaining Marvel movie of all time. Not the best, the movie is more average Marvel-wise, but this is a very fun movie.From the movie theatre I was in, everyone came out with a big smile on their face. The only other time I have seen so many smiling faces leaving the movie theatre was after the first Deadpool.A very strong 8/10, I am almost inclined to give this a 9 but this is not as good as the first movie (which I really love) and there are a few misses that reduces the score. Still great fun and very entertaining. A most watch.","

The Marvels," Worst MCU outing easily...
",jtcnight,22-Nov-23,"The fact that Disney didn't release a final trailer for this film until a couple of days before release that included shots of Captain America, Iron Man, Thanos and scenes from beloved MCU films should tell you that Disney knew they had a pile of garbage on their hands. They utilized this trailer to leave audiences to make inferences as to their connections to this film and therefore trick people into seeing this film. As for the film itself it is easily the the worst film the MCU has ever put out and Disney should be embarrassed to have done so. I would say the plot was horrendous but it actually had no plot. Some scenes were beyond cringe worthy while others were just boring and pointless. The villain was beyond laughable and demonstrated no pourpse for even being in this film. The chemistry between the leads was non existent even though their individual performances were decent. I would have preferred them to have not given us this film and instead made a second season of Ms. Marvel. The high point of this film is the mid credits scene and it's not even that consequential, though it was still cool. Do yourself a favor and save yourself from this atrocity of a film.","

The Marvels," Never write reviews but this tragedy needed one
",daniel_lauber,13-Nov-23,"Before I begin, anyone angry at this review: it is written out of LOVE for phase 1-3 MCU and because I don't want to see it shut down in 3 years. But it will without serious Change. And that makes me sad. It is not a hateful review but a guideline for what is wrong and how it can be saved.Pros: Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel is elevating and transforming awful material given to her into genuine fun; I'll be the first to admit I didn't care about her character at all upon hearing about the show but she is just a bright light among utter darkness.The rest: My god. I loved the MCU from Phases 1-3 + No way Home. But this....is this even a coherent story? No. People praise it's wacky tone which can work (loved Ragnarok) but it doesn't act as an excuse to provide 90 minutes of utter contradictory and often cringey trash with no discernible logical througline, inadvertently evil heroes, continued character assassination of Nick Fury who was perhaps my favorite character 5 years ago, zero character development leaving us with cardboard cutout flimsy characters I just know why I would care about at all, weak nonsensical insanely dumb villains and finally a continuing destruction of the universe as a whole.How did we go from Endgame to this state in just 4 years? I'd contend Avengers 1 was vastly more funny, as was Infinity War, while just being excellent films too. This is a new low and clearly the true beginning of the end of the MCU unless DRASTIC changes happen in the creative process and directors are allowed this thing called autonomy and time to produce films not just be there to carry out what they are forced to do. Additionally can we simply seal off the multiverse, and begin truly adding depth to the characters we have and any new ones. Depth includes flaws, failings and growth. That apparently is not allowed for many of this cast which can be summed up as: started perfect, is perfect, the end. (While ironically being gleefull genocidal murderers at the same time (looking at you Danvers)). This is not a good film and anyone thinking about it or unbiasedly looking at it would see that. It's even worse as part of a film universe with the amount of broken plot and rules introduced (Cptn Marvel struggles to beat a random Kree with a hammer and a bangle but can also restart a dying star with ease while flying at light speed? Light speed is so fast it means in any fight the adversary would be exploded into atoms before you could blink. Just too powerful and the definition of a 'win button' if logic were used.)MCU PLEASE clean house, reset internally, hire good writers and directors and let them MAKE FILMS, and start rebuiliding with brilliant films like Iron Man. Or continue and lose 150 million per film until you're shut down (and yes this will lose 150 million: 220 mill budget +100 mill ad spend = 320 million spent. Total box office = 340 million. Half to disney = 170 million. Loss = 150 million).The problem is not anything more complicated than terrible writing and terrible films. Not fatigue, not toxicity, not Covid, not strikes. Just bad films. Really, really, really bad films. Fix it.","

The Marvels," They are killing the money monster they accidentally created
",sangomiguel,28-Nov-23,"They are killing the money monster they accidentally created with these many productions. I think Marvel has not taken the time to build strong characters any more, like they did previously over a long, long period of time, like Spider-Man or Iron Man, and they expect us to love characters. We barely know I'm not a hardcore comic fan, so I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure they have already used up some of the big characters.The new phase has some good movies, like Love and Thunder, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc., but I just think they are just rushing everything and squeezing every last drop from the almost-gone OG cast.This production feels like it was done in three weeks, but I'm sure it wasn't. The story is just forced down on the poor audience, assuming everyone has watched all the previous releases, so it's enjoyable for them, and they don't walk out of the theater thinking, What the hell did I just watch? I can't convince my mom that Marvel is cool because she just doesn't know who is who or what's what in this particular film, just because she is not a nerd like me, who has watched 30 movies and 6 TV series. Saddly, I still love it, and I love Kamala Harris and Carol Danvers in the MCU, but just because I've watched hours worth of Marvel TV series (Wanda Vision, Secret Invasion, Hawkeye, and Ms. Marvel), I believe Marvel thinks they're more popular than they actually are in pop culture and expects the hardcore MCU fans to fill the movie theaters, which will not happen. Popular Marvel Super Heroes fill movie theaters because we've known them for years, but even we Superhero fans can't buy enough tickets to pay for this movie; they need to be smarter if they want to continue making super hero movies.I didn't really like it as a stand-alone, but since I've watched the series, I found it entertaining. But I know it's a bad movie in pretty much every aspect and could well be a TV episode you can skip. 4/10.","

The Marvels," The Bangles
",nogodnomasters,16-Nov-23,"The plot is filled with a lot of quantum space hole stuff which you have to basically ignore and enjoy the kittens. We are introduced to Kamala (Iman Vellani) of Jersey City daughter of immigrants. She idolizes Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) and dreams of being a super hero. In space Dar-Benn ( Zawe Ashton) a Kree who I confused with Thor, digs up an ancient Bangle which gives her special powers. She is going after the Skrulls an her ultimate goal we find out later as she is living on a planet with a dead sun. Kamala has the matching Bangle. Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) gets special powers and the three of them must combat Dar-Benn who looks like an olive skin Daenerys from Game of Thrones. It isn't until we discover the identity of the Annihilator does the film make any sense.This is not for serious Marvel fans. The plot while scientifically complex is make enjoyable for those who haven't watched everything in the series. There is no mention of the ""reset"" in this film, a first that I can tell. It has its own flashbacks in a dream sequence in case you missed the original. And yes people see themselves in their own memory, something Hollywood needs to work on. The film has the nerdy cosplay girl who likes kitten videos in mind as their audience. They could have called themselves 'The Bangles"" or The Marvelettes"" if they weren't taken.","

The Marvels," A Missed Catch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
",Godfather0219,27-Nov-23,"To me, ""The Marvels"" (Captain Marvel 2) can be considered the worst performance by Marvel in terms of basic skills to date. Whether it's the script, action sequences, or the pacing of comedy elements, all have glaring issues, especially in editing, which is simply astounding. The arrangement of some scene transitions is almost as problematic as in ""Scarjo"", which is truly shocking.What's subtle is that there are many places in this film that could have been developed, and the director also understands this, so those parts are highlighted. For example, the relationship between Captain Marvel and Monica, or the plot where Ms. Marvel should have been disappointed in Captain Marvel, which would have allowed her to grow further in her understanding of heroes, are all obvious areas for development.However, after these parts are pointed out, they are casually passed over with ""Pitch Perfect""-style sisterly bonding, ultimately making the whole of ""The Marvels"" like a game of catch. The ball is potential; you can always clearly see the ball, but both sides keep dropping it, with only a few successful catches. In the end, because the ball is too conspicuous, it actually highlights the chaos of the whole game.Furthermore, the acting in ""The Marvels"" is a bit confusing. Among the main characters of the film, almost only Iman Vellani, who played Ms. Marvel, turned in a sufficiently complete and consistent performance. As for Brie Larson, who played Captain Marvel, and Teyonah Parris, who played Monica, both give a sense of being at a loss, appearing indecisive between seriousness and comedy.As for the main villain played by Zawe Ashton, she was originally a boring character with no play, so it's natural that she didn't perform much. Conversely, Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury, just after the events of the series ""Secret Invasion"", suddenly became the kind of character who keeps making jokes and sarcastic remarks, making people feel that this is not the same character at all. So like Captain Marvel and Monica, it has less to do with their acting skills and more to do with the script of this entire movie, which is overly fragmented in style.Interestingly, although the problems are so obvious, the overall level of ""The Marvels"" is probably about the same as ""Thor: The Dark World"", and there is still some entertainment value. At least for me, it's easier to bear than recent films like ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", and it's more entertaining.In summary, looking at the hidden segments, ""The Marvels"" indeed holds an important position in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's just a pity that those basic skills, especially in terms of editing, are handled too poorly. At least from my personal estimation, next year's Golden Raspberry Awards will likely not miss this film...PS: By the way, I think that Park Seo-joon's planet can be considered the biggest highlight of the whole film. But because of this, the complete lack of explanation about the fate of that planet in the later plot is also a surprisingly casual arrangement that can even affect the depiction of the main characters. Honestly, I think the comedic level of that planet, even if it were used to directly make a one-season sitcom, wouldn't pose much of a problem...","

The Marvels," Take Out the Screaming... Ms. Marvel is the Heart and Soul
",jace_the_film_guy,13-Nov-23,"With over 40 projects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, it can be a bit of a headache trying to keep up with all the characters. This film does a great job reminding the audience of the main three protagonists' backstories without missing a beat. The chemistry between the three women is strong, with Captain Marvel finally feeling human.Though the stakes are high, the film is surprisingly grounded. Each character has their moment to shine, even with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. The film does not take itself too seriously, and there are many carefree moments reminiscent of ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". These humorous flashes are a staple of the MCU and work for the most part in ""The Marvels"".The villain, Dar-Benn, is as bland as they come. Her character was so forgettable that I had to look up the name of the character as I was writing this. Her motivations are strong, but the character itself is frustratingly weak.As I mentioned before, the film is packed full of humor. I would estimate that 80% of these jokes landed with the audience, with a small portion feeling out of place. Most of the comedy comes from Ms. Marvel's starstruck and overwhelmed persona, which lost its appeal very quickly. In the first 15 minutes, I cannot count how many times she screams.When the end credits rolled, I wanted to watch this movie again. Though it is not a top tier entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film is much better than ""Captain Marvel"", ""Ms. Marvel"" and other recent projects. The strength of the film is the relationship between the three leads. While I complain about Iman Vellani's over-the-top enthusiasm, her character (Ms. Marvel) was the heart and soul of the film.","

The Marvels," Marvel's Visual Spectacle With A Lot Of Fun and A Mediocre Storyline
",SAMTHEBESTEST,09-Nov-23,"The Marvels (2023)
Movie Review -The Marvels Review: Nia DaCosta brings the first ever female superheroes assembled version with The Marvels, featuring three MCU superheroes. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, and Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan join forces against Dar-benn, played by Zawe Ashton. This is the first time that we have three leading ladies and a female antagonist together in a Marvel Studios' film. That adds one more reason why this film should attract more females to cinemas. However, I, as a male viewer, didn't have any issues watching and enjoying it. The Marvels has to be one of the most comically funny superhero movies in recent times. GOTG 3 and Thor's cosmic adventure did attempt that organic comedy but couldn't bring it out the way they wanted. Here, The Marvels does it. And it's so visually attractive. Some films look grand on IMAX and are made for such experiences. The Marvels is certainly that one. What this film lacks is emotional entanglement and USP factors that define the overall motive. If you aren't looking for that, then be assured, you'll have a blast watching The Marvels this Diwali.Carol, aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), has destroyed Supreme Intelligence at Kree Land, which makes things worse for the locals. Amongst them is Dar-benn (Zawe Ashton), and she is off to settle the score with Carol, aka The Annihilator (a pet name they gave to Captain America). She harnesses the power of the Band (a similar bangle Kamala Khan has) and pairs it with her staff, named the Universal Weapon, to tear apart a jump point in space. More jump points mean more problems in the timeline and more destruction. The trio of The Marvels-Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Paris), and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani)-must assemble to stop Dar-benn from destroying earth and other planets, but there is a problem. All three female superheroes possess similar powers that are connected to the power/light and the jump point has made their powers entangled. Whenever they use power, they switch places, as in, they transport through time spaces. Will the trio overcome the problem and find a way to stop Dar-benn?It's no secret that The Marvels is the MCU's shortest movie ever, and let's hail the screenplay writer, editor, and director for that. 105 minutes is the full runtime, and you have 10 minutes of ending credits in that, so the ride is actually only about 95 minutes long. You find your seat, finish your popcorn, and half the film is over. You then put your hands on cold drinks and Samosas, and the film is over. Hell yes, it's that super-fast! MCU needed a break from some of those boring flicks that always felt 15-20 extra long, and here The Marvels did it. They were reading a lot of reviews, I guess. Even Nia was of the same opinion. When it starts, when you are in midway, and when it ends, you don't even get time to calculate that. It's FUN at all-time high for the MCU, but the only problem is that it's TOO predictable.Kamala has a bangle, so that makes her equally powerful as Dar-benn, and eventually, they win. It's too mainstream, man. Kamala's fangirling looks cute in the beginning, and since she is a teenager, it all looks so humorous. But after a while, the same fangirl moments start getting on your nerves, and you feel like, ""Is Captain Marvel a god?""We didn't know it"". The musical parts are hilarious. You don't get a moment to analyse what just happened and why you laughed. But a moment later, it all feels soapy. Are we into an opera show? I asked my friend on the right seat, and he was already scratching his head. Kamala can't use her powers to clear the mess at home. Why? Carol can't tell about her story from Aldana, but she can take Kamala and Monica there. What's the logic? Dar-benn's end and Monica's sacrifice are so overly dramatic, as if we didn't know about the end credit scene. Oh wait, there is a HUGE surprise in the end credit scene, and I should advise you not to leave your seats before that.Brie Larson's performance as Captain Marvel is maybe a typecast, but that's the best thing about her. CM has to be how fans imagine her, and she has that certain appeal beyond her glamour. Iman Vellani is set to win the hearts of all teenagers who watch the movie. Her accent and innocence just can't be hated or disliked. She is the fan girl you want to be; she's lost in a fantasy, but that's okay for that age. When she was dancing at Aladna, the entire theatre was hooting. It wasn't that high of a moment, but you know, sometimes your character and your portrayal make it bigger. Teyonah Parris, as Captain Rambeau, has done well in that emotional scene, while the rest of the time she was just passing the time with a decent act. Zawe Ashton has been impressive, be it in terms of looks or that ferocious attitude despite such a glamorous face. Zenobia Shroff's possessive mother and Mohan Kapur's Urdu dialogues are going to impress Indians, while Samuel L. Jackson's Fury remains unshakeable. Saagar Shaikh, Gary Lewis, Park Seo-joon, and other supporting cast members are okay.Talking about visuals, The Marvels is a cinematic treat. I have been lucky to get a chance to see it at IMAX, and that has certainly escalated my viewing experiences. The visual effects are simply beautiful. The fight sequences are breathtaking and so well choreographed. The first action sequence when the leading ladies keep switching places, and then in the ending when they again switch places under some boundary against the antagonist, are enough to recommend this film for big-screen viewing. I also love the sound effects of IMAX. When your seats vibrate during noisy scenes, you feel like living the moment in real life, and The Marvels has some scenes of that standard. Nia DaCosta has made a super entertaining film, no doubt. It's just cliched, that's all. From the basic surroundings to every major conflict, everything is predictable. That's the biggest issue with The Marvels. Some scenes go overboard while trying to make a funny impression, but they work against the film, especially that mediocre climax. So much hype around the band and Dan-berr and you don't even give it a proper, large-scale conclusion? The Marvels lacks a few textbook things like this, while the rest of the film is super entertaining and full of joy. Take your families and enjoy the female superheroes' assembled version from Marvel Studios this Diwali. Don't worry, the cat won't eat you.RATING - 5/10*","

The Marvels," Solid B-entry in the MCU
",Matt_Fugate,10-Feb-24,"It's not perfect. The CGI is often janky. The overarching storyline is thin.However, you know what it's not? Boring.Those unfamiliar with this Disney+ shows may struggle more than I did, but now that I think of it, it provides enough exposition for who the characters are and how they got there as any given Marvel comic book (especially those from the time of the most vocal naysayers), so you'll probably get up to speed.The performances are generally great. The girl playing Kamala Khan (sorry I can't pull her name from memory, as I'm in a different part of the app in which I'm writing this now) is particularly charming, and quite frankly, steals the movie.","

",rich-palmer-1,22-Nov-23,"I don't understand why this entry in the MCU has received so much hate from viewers (and people who haven't bothered to see the movie before expressing negative opinion of it).I thought this was once of the better MCU movies. It was funny and not super serious. Though the characters and plot were linked to the other movies/series, it was not so intertwined that viewers needed to watch all of the others to understand what was going on.With the exception of Ragnarok and the Ms. Marvel series, most of the later MCU properties have been too serious and definitely too long.This one was a joy.","

The Marvels," The worst movie in the MCU
",jimpapadakis81,26-Nov-23,"Getting right into it, this movie has quite possibly the worst villain in the MCU (and given the fact that the likes Yon-Rogg and Whiplash exist that says something) Dar-Benn has 2 goals, restore her planet's atmosphere, hydrosphere and sun after a civil war destroyed all three (and yes, they did unironically steal the plot of Spaceballs) and take revenge on Captain Marvel for destroying the Supreme Intelligence and triggering said civil war. Now, how does a planetary civil war cause the death of its sun? I don't know and neither does the movie. It's never made clear why these two motives are conflated, she could easily find an uninhibited planet to take the atmosphere and oceans from and probably its sun as well, then marshall her forces to go against Carol Danvers, trying to do both at the same time by siphoning the resources from 3 separate civilized planets that Carol has ties to not only puts her in the croshairs of the god-like being that is Captain Marvel but also makes her an enemy to pretty much every civilization in the universe, both of which might either interfere with her plan or cause a galactic crusade against Hala which could leave it worse off than it was before.Her way of achieving her convoluted goals is to use a pair of bracelets called the Quantum Bands (which actually resemble more the comic book Negabands, but I can't imagine why they wouldn't want to use that name) to manipulate the jump point system to siphon the aforementioned resources from said 3 planets. Now, nonsensical motivations are not always bad (see Thanos) as long as the villain is themselves are interesting, engaging and consistent, Dar-Benn is none of the three, the actress is simply subpar, she miserably fails to be intimidating and those metal bits in her teeth made me want to laugh every time she opened her mouth, she also has no progression in any level, her goal itself is noble, save her planet, but she tries to achieve it an triple-genocidal manner even though she doesn't have to and yet she never doubts herself nor do the atrocities she commits weigh on her in any way, her power or threat level don't fluctuate either from getting the first QB in the beginning to getting the second and blowing herself up. She's completely flat, she never progresses in power, motivation or character, she's simply ""the bad guy"" and any depth implied beyond that is an illusion that's never paid off in the script.However, as GotG proved you can have an awesome movie with an uninteresting villain as long as your heroes make up for it, in the Marvels unfortunately the protagonists are anything but. To begin with the movie is very short to fully develop three different characters, and it can't rely on previous characterization because Carol (despite already having a movie of her own) has very little actual character, Monica Rambeau is side character from a D+ show who's biggest claim to fame is excusing crimes against humanity and Ms. Marvel is arguably the most complete character but very few people watched her show, nevermind it was explicitly promised that no MCU movie would require D+ shows to be watched first. The performances don't really make up for the lack of actual characters, with Brie Larson being seemingly uninterested in the whole thing, Teyonah Parris being plain flat and Iman Vellani bringing significant energy and effort in her performance but unfortunately unable to compensate for her co-stars' failure to deliver. Meanwhile, the less said about that BTS guy the better.Now, a lack of personal development can be circumvented if the relationships between said characters are well constructed (again, the Rocket-Groot relationship in GotG Vol 1 comes to mind) but, you might've guessed it, there's very little of that, Monica is briefly mad at Carol for abandoning her and her mother even when Maria had cancer, but that's quickly overcome and henceforth the movie tries its damnest to convince you that these 3 are the best of friends and even family but it falls flat. Meanwhile, Carol, despite her appearance, is supposed to be a woman in her 60s, she never comes across as that nor as someone who has spent the last 30 years cruising space seeing any number of incomprehensible things and correcting injustices and I simply can't see her as Monica's ""aunt Carol"" because they don't just look the same age they act like it too.The main ""mechanic"" of the movie is that the 3 protagonists are ""entangled"" when Dar-Benn first utilizes the Quantum Band, it's never really explained how and why but the end result is that when the 3 use their powers at the same time, they swich places. The main reason for this isn't just to bring the leads together but also to shackle Captain Marvel with the other two because given the power she has previously demonstrated every threat in this movie should be a walk in the park, which could be fine, after all every Superman needs their Kryptonite, if they didn't apply this effect selectively and then practically forgot about it altogether. Additionally, none of them bring anything unique to the table, their powers function identically and they don't seem to utilize their unique skills at all, Monica is a scientist who rarely employs any science and Carol could be a skilled tactician and leader (finally justifying the moniker of Captain) but she displays nothing of the sort.The ending is probably the worst part of the movie The final fight takes place in a small room with space as a backdrop greatly confining them and drastically reducing the scale of the conflict despite the power levels Dar-Benn and Carol have shown before, then Dar-Benn takes the 2nd QB and it causes her to overload with power and explode after opening another portal. Also, Monica instantly just knows information (presumably because science is tantamount to clairvoyance now): she just knows Dar-Benn is gonna die after putting on the 2nd bracelet, even though she has shown no adverse effects even after prolonged use of the first, she just knows that Carol can use her powers to revive Hala's sun and survive, she just knows that the portal is a tear to the Multiverse (because what would a post-Endgame Marvel movie be without shoe-horning in the Multiverse?), she just knows her powers can close it and she just knows she has to be on the other side of it to do it. Meanwhile, as Monica is closing the portal, Carol decides to rush in to save her from getting trapped in the other universe even though that would mean the tear stays open and their whole universe is destroyed including the person she's trying to save, which either makes her a moron or a straight-up villain.She fails and afterwards she reignites Hala's sun by just flying into it and then back out with no problem whatsoever, which makes her even more overpowered than she was before, which given the lengths these same writers had to go through to tone her down so she could be part of a team seems counterproductive to any future projects involving Carol. Not that it's their problem given I don't expect any of them are gonna be involved in said projects or any future Marvel projects.Overall, the Marvels is shaping up to be the biggest box-office failure in the MCU and arguably one the biggest box office bombs for a movie of its caliber and I hope instead of blaming the SAG-AFTRA strike or ""superhero fatigue"" or whatever other excuse they have lined up, Feige and Marvel take a long, hard look at everything they've done post-Endgame and try to change their course before they irrevocably lose all the fans that elevated the MCU into the most successful franchise in history.","

The Marvels," Starts Strong, Then Goes Off Rails
",svynronin,10-Nov-23,"The movie starts strong as you get to know all 3 of the main characters. It helps that as they get to know each other, the audience also gets to know them better. The problem is what starts out as a good premise slowly delves into a chaotic story with plenty of plot holes. The main villain was subpar and seemed more of a device to create conflict more than an actual character with depth or substance. The teeth are distracting, and she doesn't come across as someone to be reckoned with, or to even really care about it. Kamala's family gets old after a while and should have stayed home, (why were they taken to space again?) It was working until Carol went to the water planet where they communicate through song. Not only was this not funny, it was weird and out of place. Her being the princess was a good idea, but it never really went anywhere and it brought up more questions than answers. Then there was the herding of cats on a space ship. The jump the shark moment if there ever was one. Did no one ask questions about this story, or were they too scared to ask? I like all three characters. All have their own unique personalities and they make a good team. They also are a good foundation for future stories. The writing on this was just terrible. It's getting to a point where Marvel just pays anyone with an idea to make a movie without any editing, criticism, or work in developing an actual story. This movie was somewhat similar to the last Thor movie, where it starts out well then goes off a cliff, or better jumps a shark.","

The Marvels," Disappointing
",rgdunc,10-Nov-23,"I know some of these characters don't get a lot of love, but, personally, I liked the Captain Marvel movie & Ms. Marvel series. So, naturally, I was really looking forward to the Marvels. Unfortunately it was a major letdown.For starters, this movie was cut to $&*#. Seriously, the editing job on this film was the worst I've ever seen. There are abrupt transitions where you ask yourself 'how did they get there' or 'when did these guys connect' or 'wait, she was just really sad/mad but now everything is fine', including a scene where the main characters face the big bad. It was jarring, and completely inexplicable. You can also tell that a lot of the backstory scenes were cut, because I feel like we were never really shown much about the motivations or history of the generic bad guy. This is the first time I can recall ever noticing the editing being an issue, outside of an indie horror film.Second, the acting was soooooooo wooden. I especially like how Ms. Marvel has been portrayed, but even her scenes fell flat. The characteristic Marvel humor felt out of place, or maybe mis-timed. Honestly it just seemed like everyone was phoning it in.Lastly, I won't spoil the credit's scene, which was cool, but it had the worst CGI that I've come across in an MCU project.Feel free to skip this one.","

The Marvels," Tiw Captain Marvel 2: Electric Boogaloo
",HeyimShibby,19-Nov-23,"Today I watched the literal worst grossing Marvel movie which was also incoherent and often stupid, dumb, and embarrassing to the point of being funnyFor starters, this movie is less boring than the captain marvel movie, which i guess is something but to be blunt I hated that movie too. Most of why it's less boring is cause it's really really stupid. It also makes Captain Marvel not as much of a unlikable character and tries to make her not a completely awful person to root forThe problem starts with this actually, like Carol Danvers in all other instances of this character is a totally rude and awful. Even in this movie, it acknowledges this character being like literally a monster. It just takes a completely different personality of a character and puts it on captain Marvel. It just pretends like she somehow developed a conscience/empathy and disregards her being a Dookie butt. Whatever who needs consistencySpeaking of consistency this movie couldn't even be consistent with its own tones? It's trying to be serious, it's trying to be funny, and it tries to make you think what youre watching is super awesome. It fails at all of those things intentionally every single time. Every instance of humor was either extremely cringe or very dumb low hanging fruit. The movie will attempt to make jokes during the very serious scenes which are never funny and are often entirely clashing with how we're supposed to be feeling. One time it even did this thing where it went into an animation that was kinda neat but it literally never did it ever again. Just a lot of questionable tones and stylistic choices that clash constantly.Sidenote, the acting sucked across the board. Brie Larson kept doing this thing where her eyes were just BULGING 👁 💋 👁 out of her head and she was just super surprised by everything. It actually ended up being very wooden. The other two ""main"" characters were also bad but I thought the character who played the niece was particularly awful. Not a single word the entire movie felt natural and she was probably my least favorite person to watch.The main villain was hilarious. Her costume(and personality) makes her look like daenyrs targaren season 8 style and she is just so over the top the entire movie. She reminds me of Eddie redmayne from Jupiter ascending or maybe even Troll 2 witch. It's hilarious to watch her lick her lips and give goofy expressions when looking at her weapons after they get powered up.I haven't even gone into the story yet man ugh. It's so bad man. Basically it just doddles around till the main villain is introduced. Characters hop around everywhere and it takes them FOREVER to figure literally anything out even though it's insanely obvious what's happening. They just keep having eureka moments like 20 minutes after the audience figures out what's happening. Then often they disregard what they've learned and conveniently things just start working differently from how they were explained in the movie just for conflict. Also Captain Marvel is insanely overpowered and she just keeps being stupid to make things harder. She's just broken OP man...There was a main conflict in the movie that was just a complete red harring(again which is obvious) but it actually just has nothing to do with the movie. Seriously there is a whole massive ps3 graphics scene that just could be taken out of the movie and it wouldn't have changed anything.Cgi throughout the movie looked really bad but those CGI cats were really some ps3 graphics man. The sets often looked fake as heck and looked like plastic or very heavily cgi gummy plastic garbage.The music was not very notable but I liked the choice to use that skillex song. I don't really remember anything musical besides that song being used, even in the scene was often filmed so horribly that I couldn't tell what was happening.And yeah lastly the cinematography was kinda awful. It was shaky and looked extremely unprofessional for a Marvel movie. It was often incoherent during action scenes and was edited together poorly.Overall this movie sucked. It was often enough so bad it's funny. This makes it at least a little more entertaining than the extremely unlikable boring snoozefest that is captain marvel. I think technically speaking, that movie is better... with this movies incompetence, I'm at least not entirely bored. Incomprehensible, badly acted, poorly shot, poorly plotted, boring music, terrible stupid movie hahaHigh 2/10.","

Teyonah Patti's as Monica Rambeau is just forgettable and Samuel l Jackson brings nothing as Nick Fury.I sincerely hope marvel at this point just stop making movies, they have lost their way, the magic is gone and they really, really need to go back to the literal drawing board with their movie formula.","

The Marvels," One Word: Boring
",steveatwal,16-Jan-24,"The Marvels (2023) is a disappointing and chaotic sequel to the much better Captain Marvel (2019). The film tries to cram in three different superheroes: Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), but fails to give any of them enough development or personality. The plot is a convoluted mess that involves a Kree villain, a mysterious wormhole, and a magic bangle that somehow links the powers of the three heroes. The film also suffers from tonal inconsistency, shifting from comedy to drama to action without any coherence or logic. The humor is forced and unfunny, the drama is melodramatic and clichéd, and the action is bland and confusing. The visual effects are also terrible, looking cheap and fake throughout the film. The Marvels (2023) is a waste of time and talent, and a clear sign that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is running out of steam and ideas. MCU needs better writers and producers to get back on course, or they will continue to lose money big time.","

The Marvels," Fun movie but not great
",miriamhonores,25-Nov-23,"The Marvels is dumb fun and is better than the first captain marvel movie, but it's not a great movie. Let's start of with the positives. The marvels themselves are great and the actresses do a great job prorating their characters. All 3 of them work great together and they make the movie fun and without them the movie would be worse. The standout was ms marvel, however captain marvel herself was very good in here and fun to watch and it's her best appearance in the MCU so far. The action was fun and some of them were directed really cool and I would definitely rewatch again. The cgi was also really good. I was never bored during the movie due to it's short runtime, the comedy was pretty good, it was also cool seeing Kate and valkeryie again, and overall the movie was just a fun, harmless movie, but it could've been so much better. Negatives, the plot was not great, the villain had motivations that you could understand but it felt like they didn't finish writing her character and she ended up becoming a very forgettable villain. This movie could've also had some amazing emotional moments with carol and Monica. They were there, but they felt very rushed and underwritten. The flashbacks were cool but I feel like that would've worked better as captain marvel 2. Also I wasn't a fan of the musical elements in the movie, I'm just not a fan of musicals and it felt very weird. Also the cat scene wasn't that great either. I also feel like the movie was rushed and there wasn't the much care put in it and if they did put care and love in it, then this movie could've been so much better but at the end of the day it's just a decent movie.","

",shihanwaliul,23-Jan-24,"Ugh...5 out of 10.Special Effects aren't everything... It seems on this movie Marvel spent too much money on CGI rather than spending that money on other qualities for example better development of the story, quality of direction, movie pace, character development, better camera angles etc. Epic music in an otherwise mundane scene just to make the movie more appealing doesn't work that well. Epic music in epic scenes, that's how it should be. There are many good moments and for that the movie deserves respect and some rating, but the bad moments balance those out so really we are just left with some disappointment.

The Marvels," Better than expected
",felix-bergman,08-Nov-23,"After the slew of forgettable low rating Marvel movies and Disney+ series since Endgame, and particularly after the roller coaster of mixed quality that was the Ms. Marvel show, I didn't have too high hopes going in to this one, but was pleasantly surprised. It could have done away with some forced cameos and some repeated scenes that does basically the same thing over and over, and instead focused a bit more on character growth and dialogue, but over all it worked well. The three leads of Monica Rambeuo, Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel worked well together, it didn't feel like they were rubbing it in the audience face that it was a female lead cast, it was just a super hero movie that happened to have female leads. At 105 minutes it's on the shorter end for a Marvel movie, but it means it is more dense and rarely gets stale and it doesn't overstay it's welcome, though the comic reliefs in the form of Kamala's family and Goose the cat/flerken could have been given slightly less screen time in my opinion. One of the biggest problems is that to fully be on track going in you have to have watched not only Captain Marvel and Endgame, but also WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. It's getting very hard to keep up and make sure you are caught up and remember enough before going in to each new marvel movie, but if you aren't you could be left clueless as to what is going on. Over all not on par with Marvels best, but a step in the right direction compared to the latest bunch on movies, a sentiment I heard echoed from several of the 50 or so people that had made it to the cinema for opening night.","

",mohammad-z,20-Nov-23,"I am not a loyal MCU watcher. I watched many of the MCU movies and also some episodes of series from the MCU, so maybe my lack of understanding is partly due to this.But disregsrding the MCU continuity understanding of the movie, parts of it were just too lazy written. The jokes were mostly lame, I laughed once and that was because I thought of how ridiculously this was written. I don't expect a blockbuster to make scientific sense, but a little bit more effort in made up stuff helps the viewer to believe the story their in.From the story standpoint this movie is a certain 0 out of 10.The acting of some of the lead cast and supporting roles was quite impressing. Which is probably the only good thing about the movie besides some ideas as well.CGI of characters was pretty bad, reminded me of 90s CGI.If you are a MCU fan watch it, everyone else expect nothing good and you might have a few good minutes.","

For instance, Kamala being in her costume, then suddenly switching places with Carol, and now she's falling from the sky but in street clothes with no explanation.

The Marvels," In the mouth of madness
",roaches_97,19-Nov-23,"Just to be clear, I did not hate watch this movie. My theater membership allows me to see one free movie per month, and for November this was the movie. I saw the mediocre reviews and thought that there were probably worse ways to kill two hours. I suppose I was right, but this has to go pretty low on that list. I don't know how this got released in the state it did. The last marvel movie I watched was Thor 4 and that was also an incompetent mess, although The Marvels wasn't as bad. I genuinely can't think of any positives for this movie. The only reason I gave it a 2/10 is because I don't think it ever becomes comically awful aside from one scene. The two most widely praised elements of the movie were the action and the actress who played Ms Marvel. The action was your standard CGI marvel goyslop, and Ms Marvel was very annoying. I guess she was fine compared to how flat the other two leads were but not by much. Don't go see this movie. It is a good thing that this movie is bombing as hard as it is. Maybe marvel will learn some kind of lesson from this, but it's more likely that they'll just keep paying to bring back legacy characters.","

The Marvels," Worst of the MCU movies
",lindseyt1181,12-Nov-23,"I'm a huge fan of the marvel universe but I was so disappointed in this movie. It seems like Marvel is over doing it with too many shows and movies coming out all the time. Basic storytelling is being lost. For this movie it felt like everything about it was rushed and not thought out well enough. Lazy script writing, and no emotion. I kept looking at my watch in the theater waiting for it to end. Some of the situations wrapped up too neatly with no real context on how that happened. Hard to explain without spoilers but I rolled my eyes several times and I've never done that in a movie theater. If you want to see it wait for it to come on streaming. Paying all that money to see it in the theater was such a waste. The only good thing about it was the end credit scene.","

The Marvels," 💡 That Speech and Smile that Darbenn gives in Hala showed me a Glimpse of another Film that this Could of Been, But the MCU Undercut themselves yet again 🤷
",DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,12-Nov-23,"Just Got out of an IMAX 3D ScreeningDamnit, this Film is a bit of a Dilemma(And Recently, as Usual the MCU put themselves into a Dilemma in the First Place)So Considering this Film - The MarvelsIt was Very Entertaining but the Writing, although having some good Ideas, is Just Terrible. Here's my Summary of what I think.There are Multiple Ideas within this Film that are Underutilized that could of made a Better Film -1. That Speech and Smile that Darbenn gives in Hala showed me a Glimpse of another Film that this Could of Been.2. Captain Marvel being called the ""Annihilator"", a Villain, just an outright Menace in Certain peoples eyes.3. Ms Marvel looking up to Captain Marvel as her Idol, her Hero, only to find out that ""Death seems to follow you"" as Darbenn puts it. Again, another missed Opportunity.4. Captain Rambeau and Captain Marvels Dynamic and Relationship was Barely touched upon. Because of that, the Payoff of the emotional moment at the end Never Happens.These were some really interesting ideas 💡 that they should of really put more detail into. WHAT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY! 😠What do we get in this Film?1. So we have Hala Dieing and Missing Key Elements, Air, Water & Sunlight, because of the A. I. being Destroyed by the ""Annihilator"", which leads to a Civil war, (wait? How does a Civil war lead to Hala losing an Entire Sun 🌞 🤔🤦🏻)2. I liked The 3 Marvels Performances - Captain Marvel - Great Look and I liked her Performance. Captain Rambeau - I liked her Style and her Screen Presence. Iman Vellani as Ms Marvel - Super Cute and Just Adorable 😘3. The Singing Planet Segment (Which was Entertaining) and Subsequent Water Siphoning.4. The Fight Scenes were Pretty Good, Specifically the Teleportation Fight Near the Start of the film and the End Fight 3 Vs 15. The Cats Scene which was Hilarious, when the Cats started running after them and the Announcer said ""Please stop Running, so that the Cats can Eat you"".6. Darbenn unceremoniously exiting the film, just so a damn Wormhole can open up, which leads me to......................The Dilemma - The Villain in this Film could of been another Great MCU Villain but they Undercut the Villain just so that The X-*** can enter the MCU through the Marvels and the Subsequently, the Rest of the MCU.In other words, a shared Cinematic Universe is Fantastic
...............until it isn't.......and pulls stunts like this that take away from the overall Film.....and what could of been. 😔Overall, Those issues are so brain dead and awful, that this is a 4 outta 10. However, it was an entertaining film 😂. Also, those missed opportunities I had with the Film were Glaring.","

The Marvels," MCU had died. RIP Marvel.
",lisafordeay,19-Jan-24,"The Marvels is a 2023 MCU movie and is the 33rd Marvel film. Starring Brie Larson,Zawe Vellani,Teyonah Paris and Samuel L Jackson. Its also the sequel to the 2019 Captain Marvel,and a continuation of the Disney Plus show Ms Marvel.Clocking in at 1 hour and 44 minutes the film is about Carol Denvers(Larson) who finds a wormhole and meets a super fan called Ms Marvel(Vellani) and her friend Monica(Paris). What happens next is people are out to get them including Dar Ban(Ashton) who seeks revenge.Will Carol and her crew save the day ? Overall this film is one giant mess. What happened to Captain Marvel

The Marvels," Way more entertaining than expected
",idontdodrugs,08-Nov-23,"So after being continuously dissappointed with Disneys Marvel productions after Endgame, as self-proclaimed completionist, I also watched this little chapter.Let's focus on the lead trio first:
I had quite some problems with the first Captain Marvel movie, specifically Brie Larson that came off as a quite unpleasant character and way too perfect in the context of the story. I liked her better here - the story made her not so perfect anymore and she tried to tone down her apparently innate smugness.Although I wasn't very convinced by the Ms. Marvel tv series, I thought that Iman Vellani gave an engaging and somehow charming performance. Her portrayal as the fangirl worked.I guess Teyonah Parris did alright, although I kept thinking that her character didn't really bring much to the table apart from being ""the explainer"".What did not work was the relationship between Parris and Larsons characters in the story....that just did not resonate.Let's get to the villain. Well, she had an interesting look. That's all I can say about her. Her motivation is quite dumbed down and her character just felt flat all around. Sad, could have been handled way better in the context of the story.Visually I'd say it was better than some previous isntallments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I didn't mind some CGI imperfections, it was colorful and varied.Regarding the action scenes I'm torn. They are cut in manner that makes it hard to follow sometimes and nothing special, but they entertained, even though there was no emotional heft in any of them.The story is as simple as it gets, but at the same time there are so many inconsistent rules and logical flaws that at some point you just give up. The mechanic of the switching places is pretty much just a gimmick that makes barely any sense in the story. It's essentially an amusement park ride, you rush from A to B to C and you never really care why.What is good and bad at the same time is the pace. It has no lengths so it flies by fast. But it also seems to have been made for the TikTok generation, requiring virtually no attention span. This comes at the cost of character depth. But maybe it's better that way, confer above comments on the story.Having sad all that, I nevertheless give this a 7. I was entertained by it. It is mindless, it is sometimes cringy but is also ok fun.","

The Marvels," So underwhelming, Flat, boring acting
",emercer-94716,14-Nov-23,"Welp, I don't think anyone thought this was going to be a smash hit, but this was just surprisingly terrible. Just a steaming mess. Totally boring and worn out plot. Edited to the point where it feels like a lot is missing but somehow you are also relieved because you don't really want any more either. Characters are unengaging and frankly not likeable or interesting. Brie Larson still can't act her way out of a paper bag. And has stopped even pretending to look interested in what she is doing. You get the vibe that she shot this on lunch break from some other thing she actually wanted to be doing. Total waste of time. Miss this one.","

The Marvels," Disney tossing diamonds on a dung heap with a fantastic cast having to work with a clumsy script.
",VaughanMurrae,20-Nov-23,"The Marvels entertained me. It didn't rock my world, and it's no fault of casting or the decision to make a woman lead film.The writing is just a bit of a hot mess. I think Marvel writers across the franchise have written themself into a corner by not adapting to the needs of comic lore in a technomoderized world. The science in the film didn't sustain belief, and the motivations of the antagonist was unnecessarily convoluted, the furry subplot; an afterthought.Without good science, narratives like the multiverse, cosmic settings and space ecosystems do not hold together in the minds of viewers.The interpersonal politics lately has been unimaginative and way too human, and American, centric producing derivative content with space dressing.In other films, the humour in Marvel films was there to support the main plot, and allow the audience respite through its more serious content. Since the serious content is falling flat, the humour is trying to do all the heavy lifting and it's coming across canned and awkward. You see this in Thor Love and Thunder, you see it in some of the series work on Disney.Back to The Marvels. The cast carried themselves really well and were entirely believable in the characters they played. Honestly, I felt kind of like Disney was tossing diamonds on a dung heap with their fantastic casting having to work with a clumsy script with first draft energy, that leaves the audience distracted by its shortcomings. What a waste.Imo, the person that truly carried this film, EVERY TIME she was on screen was Toronto's Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan. She lit every scene, and that says a lot with heavy hitters like Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson sharing the screen.All in all, I do not regret my ticket purchase, and I WILL rewatch on streaming AND add the blu ray to my Marvel collection. I was entertained, but also a more than a little peeved.I hope Disney and its Marvel Studios franchise can pull it together and remember how to create art.6/10 stars.","

The Marvels," Kevin Feige should apologize
",ericknromero,19-Nov-23,"Dumb. Such a dumb movie.I did't hate it, and was actually thinking it was fairly decent halfway through. Then they decided to get intentionally goofy.I had no problem with the actors, production value, or even the musical cues. The basic story is fine. The initial set-up and introductions were good enough. I liked the bad guy, though I wish they would have given her more development. But you take a pretty birthday cake and throw cat poop on it then hold it to the audience and say ""See how hilarious this is?!"" Shame, because I don't think even kids would like it.Who is responsible for these decisions? That's the question I asked myself a few times in the theater as I sat through an experience that made Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner feel both more grounded and entertaining in those old cartoons. Wasting powerful characters and an intriguing concept, not to mention a really good motivation for the villain, has been Marvel's specialty in their movies lately. Let's hope all these rumors about them resetting some things about how they produce content are true.A few more minutes developing each of the main characters would have made a world of difference, but instead they used that time for cat jokes and a musical number. Are they trying to tank their brand?","

The Marvels," A Disappointing Addition to the Franchise
",randomgui,29-Nov-23,"As a long-time fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I was eagerly awaiting the release of ""The Marvels"" in 2023. However, after finally watching it, I must say that the film left me hugely disappointed. Here's why:1. Muddled Storyline: ""The Marvels"" suffered from a convoluted and messy plot. The filmmakers seemed to cram too many characters and subplots into a single movie, resulting in a lack of focus and coherence. It felt like they were trying to replicate the success of Avengers, but failed miserably in creating a cohesive narrative.2. Weak Character Development: Despite bringing together three incredibly powerful heroines, ""The Marvels"" failed to give any of them proper development. The characters lacked depth, making it hard to form any emotional connection with them. This was a wasted opportunity to explore their individual journeys and strengths, leaving viewers disconnected and uninterested in their struggles.3. Poor Chemistry: A major disappointment was the complete lack of chemistry among the main characters. The dynamic between Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Monica Rambeau was forced and lacked any natural charm. The interactions between them often felt contrived and unconvincing, leaving me wishing for more impactful and engaging performances.4. Underwhelming Action Sequences: For a Marvel film, the action sequences were shockingly dull. The choreography was uninspired, with repetitive fight scenes that failed to excite or engage the audience. With the vast array of superpowers and abilities in the Marvel Universe, it was baffling to see such lackluster action on display.5. Anticlimactic Villain: The villain of ""The Marvels"" was completely forgettable. Their motivations were unclear, and their screen time was limited to few inconsequential scenes. There was no real threat or sense of danger, which undermined the stakes and made the climax feel underwhelming.Overall, ""The Marvels"" was a disappointment in almost every aspect. From a messy plot to weak character development and lackluster action sequences, this film failed to capture the essence of what makes Marvel movies so special. It pales in comparison to previous entries in the franchise, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and let down.","

My research has found that tween girls like kittens, sisterhood, jump rope, musicals, being a princess, and also kicking butt with no real arc.It wasn't made for me. I didn't fork out to see it.

",znelson74-698-762239,11-Nov-23,"With a short run time, they did very well with the pacing of the film. Bringing in characters from both the tv side and previous movies worked really well to create a story for everyone. Plenty of lighthearted and emotional character arcs that made the film even more grounded then other marvel films with longer run times. Great thing is, there is no need to see any of the Disney plus shows because the film does a great job giving you a brief backstory of Ms. Marvel. The duo of Carol and Monica work great along with Kamala and her family. Plenty of laughter from great one liners that made me leave waiting for the next movie.

The Marvels," The Marvels Review!
",Chaosfn,11-Nov-23,"Prepared to the other Marvel Movies that released this year The Marvels was the one I was the least excited for, but the main question here is was it the worst Marvel Movie of this year. In my opinion no it wasn't, but even if it wasn't the worst Marvel Movie of the year that still isn't a big compliment. The biggest compliment I can give this Movie is I definitely prefer it over the first Captain Marvel Movie, but honestly the first Captain Marvel movie is already very bad itself, anyway let's continue talking about The Marvels. The three main characters Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau, and Kamala Khan are currently switching with each others spots each time they use there powers at the same time, and while they deal with this issue the main villain Dar-Benn tries to get revenge on Carol Danvers because of something that happened in their past. The plot of The Marvels is extremely simple and also pretty generic, it's like saying the heroes are trying to stop the bad guy because he or she is doing bad guy stuff. Also the Movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions, and a lot of unnecessary scenes. This Movie is already the shortest MCU Movie out there, but yet the Movie could've been 30 Minutes shorter and barely nothing would've changed. I do have two positive things to say though, Iman Vellani is the perfect actress for Kamala Khan, and also Goose is cute as hell. Overall The Marvels is a big generic mess, it might be better than the worst Marvel Movie this year which was Quantumania, and it might be better than the first Captain Marvel Movie, but it's still kinda bad even though it does have its moments!","

The Marvels," There's Trouble In The MCU
",mattclap28,21-Nov-23,"It's fair to say that the Disneyfication of the MCU is near completion or may well be finally served by the near disaster of this film. The saving grace is that its not anywhere near three hours long.The Marvrls centres itself around Carol Denvers (aka Captain Marvel) who has been burdened with a destabilised universe akin to a Kree revolution. Whilst saving the day her powers are entangled with two other superheroes causing them team up as The Marvels.The problem is straight out the script. For a sequel, there is really no character development and the story itself is rather thin, to the point where you sit wondering where the whole MCU is heading. It's frustrating if you're a lover of the initial phases of this marvellous universe, sadly it's hard to see if it's ever coming back.","

The Marvels," Better than Captain Marvel, but could've been better
",ajacayen-90247,08-Nov-23,"IT HAS BEEN a while ever since I went to a theater to see a Marvel movie. Because of how uninterested I was, let alone how Quantumania and Love and Thunder hindered my love for superhero movies, I have become indifferent with the MCU. Fortunately, because of how cool the trailers look and the return of one of my favorite Marvel heroes alongside two other characters I am unfamiliar, I am curious to see how The Marvels would turn out, which is a sequel to Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel. I would say that, for the most part, it is an enjoyable film but with major creative decisions that did not quite work with me.Starting off with the positives, in my point of view, is Brie Larson's Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel finally having more personality. Unlike the first one where she felt too stoic and showing little to no emotions, here she was able to show off her soft side whenever she is interacting with the other two superheroes and as she tries to become a leader since she hasn't been able to manage a team yet.Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan or Ms. Marvel was an absolute delight to see on the big screen. Even though I am aware that not a lot of people have seen her television show or may not have liked it in general, we cannot deny how much energy she brings whenever she was given the screen time. Even though some of her jokes did not land, you can see how she reacts to serious situations, striving not just to get appreciation from Captain Marvel but becoming a real superhero.As for Monica Rambeau played by Teyonah Parris, there were moments from her that I thought she was cool whenever she was showing off her powers, especially when she is fighting together with Kamala and Danvers. But there are things that I felt were just unresolved or was like an emotional baggage towards Carol that just didn't work for me.The rest of the cast was fine. The Khan family were all adorable and supportive to look at whenever they interact with Kamala, Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury is as good as always but Park Seo-joon felt like he was there but for no reason at all. But of course, like with almost every Marvel movie, the villain always tends to be underutilized. Even though Zawe Ashton did her best in her role as Dar-Benn, I wish she could have been better.Speaking of ""could have been better"", the film's runtime, which is actually the shortest for an MCU film, truly affected the story. There are a lot of sequences that could have been expounded a lot more and the way the movie progressed felt too fast, like it wasn't giving enough time for fans to take in the information and just being spoon-fed a lot by Rambeau. This includes how the superheroes are switching in the first place and how they are able to track down following planets.Not to mention that certain scenes in the second act felt so off and just trying to be funny for the sake of it - which is one of the major reasons why the MCU is already in a decline in terms of quality. I would not give out any spoilers but let me just say that it transitioned to genres that I did not expect and it actually turned me off for a while, just waiting for it to be over and go back to saving the universe again.In conclusion, The Marvels is most likely going to make people even more turned off due to the creative decisions that were made, probably from the studio as shown in several videos on YouTube. But on my end, just ignoring how the franchise is being ridiculed as of this moment, I would say that the cast saved most parts of the film and in a way, was better than Captain Marvel and not as bad as people might expect - but could have been so much more.","

Evidently you can genderflip just about anyone in the MCU. It also does its job in the Introducing Young Avengers department.Either way, many thanks to whoever's idea it was to combine Nick Fury and a bunch of cute cats. Meow ^^","

The Marvels," The Marvels: A Mixed Bag of Superhero Potentia
",abphadore,03-Jan-24,"In the expansive Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""The Marvels"" emerges as a film with both hidden gems and glaring imperfections. While it holds the potential to shape the overarching narrative, it falls short in delivering a fully satisfying storyline.Despite being an underrated addition to the MCU timeline, ""The Marvels"" feels somewhat half-baked, struggling to delve deeply into the character arcs of key figures. The backgrounds of pivotal characters, such as the villain Dar-Benn and Captain Marvel's husband Prince Yan, are presented as mere fillers rather than substantial contributors to the plot. Brie Larson, reprising her role as Carol Danvers, brings a commendable performance, but her character seems to lack the same charismatic spark seen in her solo movie and ""Avengers: Endgame.""Teyonah Parris stands out as a bright spot, delivering a strong performance that hints at the potential for a stand-alone sequel. However, the film's weakest link appears to be Iman Vellani as Miss Marvel. As a character poised to lead the Young Avengers in the future, Vellani's portrayal falls short, indicating a need for more intensive acting workshops to bring depth to her performance.The film's storyline adaptation, creative choices, and certain scenes leave room for improvement. The narrative fails to provide the necessary depth and exploration required for a truly satisfying superhero experience. The gaps in character development and the incomplete backstories of key figures hinder the movie from reaching its full potential.""The Marvels"" sits on the precipice of greatness, showcasing glimpses of brilliance amid its shortcomings. As the MCU continues to expand, one can only hope that subsequent entries will refine the storytelling and character exploration, allowing these Marvels to truly shine in the superhero pantheon.","

The Marvels," MEOW
",imdbscuff,25-Dec-23,"I attempted to watch 'The Marvels', contemplating whether a cinema visit might have been the better choice. Intriguingly, the film features a cat in a seemingly pivotal role. This feline character is not merely a background element; it prominently meows throughout, almost as if to constantly remind viewers of its presence - perhaps even enticing them to purchase related merchandise. However, this recurring meowing inadvertently distressed my own cat, leading to a rather frustrating viewing experience for me. Expecting a cinematic escape, I instead found myself managing my pet's anxiety and confusion, caused by the illusion of another cat's presence. Regrettably, I discontinued watching after 20 minutes. I hope that someday, a cat owner within the Marvel Studios team will recognize that such repetitive animal sounds are unnecessary and can be disruptive for household pets. Until then, viewers like myself might face unexpected challenges in enjoying their films.","

You know it's a problem when the cats are the best part of the movie. Sadly they are only on for about 20 minutes in total. The rest of the movie you are simply sitting there wondering when it will get better, or when this thing will start to make any real sense in the entire MCU - hint, it never does. Frankly, if you never see this movie you will not miss a thing.","

The Marvels," DNF awful music, ridiculous plot
",lockdown11,16-Jan-24,"Full disclosure: walked out after witnessing Nick Fury yelling BLACKGIRLMAGIC!! Thankfully was able to get a refund. My condolences to anyone that had to endure the rest of this trainwreck.Up until that point I had to endure a dumb plot, wooden exposition explaining other movies and shows to understand who these people are, and some of the most horrifically bad music to ever ooze through speakers. Just terrible, bombastic, distracting music - at one point during a pew-pew laser shootout there was the most cringe high-pitched rapper yelling RATTATATAATAAATAAATATA (and not in the great Missy Elliot style)
Shame on everyone responsible for this atrocious entry in the MCU as it may be the final nail to kill it off.","

While the chemistry and individual performances are enough to keep me entertained, the extremely poor writing and lackluster cookie cutter villain don't.

Kamala Khan is by far the light and star of the movie and even Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) gives a much better performance than hers from Captain Marvel the movie. Unfortunately they both deserved much better movies than what we got. You can have fun with this, however if the characters aren't enjoyable to you, you'll find this movie miserable.","

The Marvels," The Definition of ""Meh""
",thebyrdistheword,01-Jan-24,"This movie was so forgettable im struggling to remember what happened and I just got home from the theater. I couldn't tell you the villains name if I tried. I couldn't tell you why the things that were happening mattered. For the life of me I don't understand why the massively overpowered captain marvel is having a hard time fighting some kree warrior lady with a staff when the last time we saw her she was physically besting Thanos?This movie blows. And it's unfortunate because the captain marvel character can be really cool. I went in truly giving this movie the benefit of the doubt. It's tonally weird. One minute it's a silly buddy comedy, the next minute it's a family drama, and then before you know it you're in a world ending superhero blockbuster. It was clearly a longer movie that was cut way down for quality and to be honest that's probably for the best. I can't imagine a longer version of this movie making it better.Brie Larson was not good, and that's an unfortunate thing in my opinion. She just doesn't act well in this movie. I've seen her do quite well in other projects. Even recently she does a really decent job in a new show on Apple TV. So part of me wonders if it's not just her but if Marvel has simply failed to give her good direction of what the personality and tone of the character is meant to be. She's bad in pretty much every scene in this movie. She seems very awkward and not in the funny kind of way. Shes not believable when she's being tough, she's not moving when she's being dramatic, and she's not the slightest bit funny at any point in the film. Of the few times we've seen her play captain marvel this by far is the worst.The movie lacks pretty much anything to make it interesting. Bland visual effects, average to poor acting, a lame disinteresting villain, a simple yet boring plot, below average costume and set design. You name it and this movie has a meh version of it to offer up.At the end of the day, when the best thing your movie has to offer is random Samuel l Jackson jokes, cat jokes, and the humor of Kamala khans blue beetle esque family dynamic you probably don't have a winner on your hands.This movie makes me long for the days of Thor 2.","

The Marvels," Like coming in at the end and not knowing, many questions
",KatieDuncan44,20-Nov-23,"The main character interactions and comradarie was cute and fun. The family was cute and fun.The movie itself had many interesting aliens and spaceships and fights and what not. Cool technology.I had to read two Wikipedia articles during the movie to understand the movie. I watched the other two marvel movies that had Captain marvel but not the TV show. I was just not knowing the background of what was going on. It felt like I missed five movies to understand what was happening. But, I didn't miss anything. It was awhile ago that I watched the first Marvel movie though.Though I could understand what was happening, it felt like I walked in 3/4 into the movie or something. Like a lot happened already and I'm coming in at the end.That's the feeling of this movie.Though it was very understandable even though, I wish we had more background on how the technology worked and technology of the aliens as well. And just now background on the aliens.And more understanding of Marvels abilities and why. All three Marvels for that reason. It sounds corny, but they maybe should have come out with a prequel to this movie or started this movie with a recap. Like once upon a time, etc.It made me more curious on the universe and everything though.I liked the group dynamics of the movie, but it made it so there wasn't a main character and you didn't really get to focus and get to know one character very well either.There's a lack of intimacy and feelings of empathy with the screen for that reason..","

The Marvels," It simply does not deliver.
",markkupost,09-Dec-23,"I must admit that based on the trailers, I really - really - had wanted to like this movie.Everything about the movie felt very disjointed, rushed and ... ultimately quite pointless. For example, in the Ms. Marvel Disney+ -show, they included a Bollywood-style dance-sequence that - frankly in the context of that series, fit nicely and didn't feel out of place. However, when they've tried including similar one in The Marvels -movie ... it just ... falls flat. It comes out of nowhere, serves no purpose and - just feels weird and forced.Of course, I had the huge misfortune of watching this movie in 3D (I didn't realise that 3D versions of movies are still made) which means that there were constant exaggerated scenes with ""too much"" depth and a ton of CGI to add to that. Watching the movie this way felt nauseating.So as to not only bash the movie, there are a few things I genuinely liked. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is possibly the best addition to MCU post-Endgame; her portrayal of the character feels very fresh and natural. It is like she was made for the role. Also, the montage where Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan are learning to use their joint powers together. That part was actually well executed and quite fun to watch. But unfortunately it was only a few minutes out of a very short movie.","

The Marvels," Nowhere near as bad as expected
",alex-mott,08-Feb-24,"If you watch this film through a window of political agendas, you probably won't like The Marvels. If you don't, it's just a harmless, fun, slightly scatty Marvel chick flick. On the plus side it's not a Jaws 2 re-run, but a good sequel and story continuation due to the additional cast and backstory each character brings. There's also a much more relatable Carol Danvers (rather than the completely invincible character seen to date) and a revenge story so simple a child could follow it - although I wasn't clear how a civil war on Hala caused problems with their sun. Whilst slightly gross, using the flerkens as a means of emergency transport makes perfect, practical sense to the mind of an engineer and the accompanying music from Cats was a nice comedic touch. On the downside it could have done without the singing planet sequence, the CGI is dodgy in places and the pacing is sometimes uneven. This could be related to the reported production problems and reshoots, but the fight scene with the Skrulls in Kamala's house went on too long and the ending seemed rushed (imo). Compared to the recent run of disastrous female-fronted films (Terminator: Dark Fate, Ghostbusters, Annihilation and Charlie's Angels) The Marvels is probably the best out of the lot.","

The Marvels," One of the better recent Marvel Films!
",djrmc24,27-Jan-24,The Marvels breathes in fresh air into the Marvel Universe and is a fun action adventure that never overstays it's welcome. Director Nia DaCosta does a very good job here with directing her first big budget film after doing such a wonderful job on the latest Candyman movie. The Marvels speeds by with action after action and has a pretty straight forward plot. The chemistry between the 3 Leads here are great. My only complaint is that this movie has a Villian issue and that seems to be the theme for recent Marvel films. Don't listen to all of the online mess about this movie. Go see it for yourself!

It was hilarious, the dynamic between all 3 Marvels was so entertaining and fun, it was light hearted for most of the movie, and (finallllyyy) it was a movie with the perfect duration - not too long and not too short. There were some scenes that was supposed to be emotional, but didn't come off too emotional - either because the acting or dialogues was off or because it was countered by a quick humorous scene. But otherwise it was a great family fun watch! Also the post credits is one to sit and wait for, it was a great reveal to future Marvel movies!","

Brie Larson, Teyonah Parrish, and Iman Vellani all have real good chemistry, you get a feeling they all had a blast.The space scenes are quite effective, and sets look like they where recycled from Star Wars films. The moments when the characters use there powers makes it the most fun in the theater, like playing a fun video game. Samuel L. Jackson brings his charm has Nick Fury. Zawe Ashton is also great as Dar-Benn. If you are a Marvel fan you know what to see in the mid credits.","

The Marvels," The Marvels
",jack_o_hasanov_imdb,12-Nov-23,"Although it was a fun movie, it was bad and unnecessary. In any case, I went into the film with no expectations. Even though there are bad movies and TV series, I like Marvel's works, and I want to watch them even if I don't like them. Captain Marvel is not as bad as it has been portrayed; it is simply poorly written. It was not what I expected from this movie. I had a feeling I was going to watch a bad film. The plot of the film is simple and could have been told as a series; for example, Ms. Marvel's season 2. It could be described as the second season of Marvel. The acting wasn't very good. Ms. Marvel character seems likable to most people, but although I sometimes find it likable, sometimes I don't find it likable, and I see it as a contrived character trying to be sympathetic. Overall, I had fun with the movie, but it was a bad movie and didn't add anything new to the MCU. I liked both scenes after the movie; of course, the second and last scenes were very important for the future of the MCU and were expected. Anyway, the movie is bad. By the way, one of the best scenes in the movie was the one with cats.","

Plot is all over the place. I've never read the comics so I have no idea if movies follow them at all. But where did all the character building and development and depth go? Why would I want to watch 2 hours of special effects I've seen a million times. Or the mindless running all over the place. It's just too much of grande nothing.That thing with the Flerkens was the best part of this movie, and that is very telling.Brie Larson is awesome as always but I wish Captain Marvel had gotten a better movie.","

",rudolfwinklarson,14-Nov-23,"When will Marvel finally realise that their formula for producing films is just too much for most people to stomach. Regardless of that, all the main characters here are absolutely interchangeable and colourless. There is no character development and the CGI is even worse than in Ant-Man 3. And that's a real achievement. I couldn't care less about the three heroines. And Nick Fury's character has finally been labelled an absolute laughing stock. I won't go into the story now, as it would be an insult to my intellect to think again about the thousands of gaps in logic. I hope we can now all experience the end of the Marvel films together. NO, I don't need any more films of such lousy quality. It's just more cheeky that something like this is marketed as a cinema film. Audiovisual quality like this is better suited to the afternoon programme of some TV channel, somewhere between Malcolm in the Middle and The Simpsons.

The Marvels," A bright, tight, and fast superhero film that really deserved to do so much better than it did at the boxoffice!
",jdlewisinc,03-Feb-24,"Late last year, I saw The Marvels, and, going upstream against the overwhelming tide of popular opinion,...*I LOVED IT!* It was the shortest of the Marvel films. Coming in at just under two hours, the film moved at such a rapid clip. The film was shorter, tighter, and it held my attention the entire run time! As much as I really liked the first Captain Marvel film, it was padded and a bit of a slog at times, occasionally dragging at certain points. Not so, this time! I didn't even mind when at points certain subplots frequently threatened to become a cross between a Candy Crush video game and a Bollywood musical! (This summer's monster megahit Barbie film quickly crossed that Bollywood musical line and it never came back!)If I had any criticisms, it's that, firstly, the film far too quickly glossed over the reason why the Kree race now calls Captain Marvel ""The Annihilator"". That revelation was very crucial and is far too important a plot point to quickly gloss over. Secondly, speaking of ""far too quickly"", the finale quickly devolved into a non-stop slugfest, but then again, that's just what I want out of a superhero action movie. If I'm ever in a mood for a thinkfest, that's just what films like Watchmen and Oppenheimer are for! Does that make me an easily pleased person? Yes, it does. Am I ashamed of that? No, I am not! For better or for worse, I unconditionally enjoyed The Marvels, warts and all, but don't take my word for it, go see it and judge it for yourself! End of soapbox sermon!","

The actors are not bad but the plot and action scenes are disappointing. Brie Larson is a great actor but was truly wasted with this script. The move goes nowhere quickly jumping from disaster to even bigger disaster. I don't know who writes this. Marvel franchise has truly lost the plot since Disney took over. I only hope and pray that they can get a better story, even the characters especially the villain does not entertain at all it's a great waste of two hours. If you are bored out of your mind or on a plane with nothing else to watch give it a chance. If not give it a skip as there are far better movies and series out there.","

Rescue people with cats? Someone running around stealing natural resources for their planet.... Honestly this could have and probably should have been a mini-series on Disney... would have saved Disney and the fans money.Like some of the other reviews mention, it is clear this was written for a younger not so standard/typical marvel fan base and it shows.

As a comic movie is not supposed to be your all-action no-fun movie, but a comical action movie.The comical spirit of Ms Marvel versus Captain Marvels and Captain Rambeau's disciplined spirit is the best combo, I thought we would never see from Marvel anymore, with the Guardians as the only exception.

The Marvels," Nice CGI, Shame about the movie
",rcuttill,10-Nov-23,"Congratulations. Very few movies get 5 or below from me and this is one of them. Normally a film gets 7 if i consider it ok, 8 if I'd watch it again and 6 if I think it sub-par. Very few get anything but 6,7 or 8. This year Police State, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour and Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One got a 9 and The Great Escaper got 10. The last time anything got a 5 was Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, 2022.What can I say about this movie? First of all a rather unconvincing villain with a plan that unfolds in a rather undramatic way. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel teams up with Carol's estranged niece Captain Rambeau and super-fan Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel. Ms Marvel has newly acquired powers. They get proficient as a team surprisingly fast. There's plenty of fights and space vistas. Who's doing what is not always obvious. The only amusing bit was with the kitties. You'll see. I can't see repairing a rift in space and time like it's crocheted together as really convincing. So it's quite a spectacle but with a rather weak plot.","

The Marvels," Lights, Lazer And Super Ladies Illuminate The Screen With Heroic Brilliance !!!
",cs_rahul_prasad,28-Jan-24,"Captain Marvel is reeling under the guilt of being the Annihilator, after destroying the Supreme Intelligence, and subsequently triggering a civil war. Hala, the homeworld of the Kree, is dying with no air, water and a diminishing sun. Its new leader, the formidable Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) has managed to find one half of the pair of the Quantum bands. The second half is with an unassuming 16-year-old Captain Marvel fan-girl Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), who soon finds herself in the midst of the most important mission in the world, along with her idol, Captain Marvel.It's a standard template of superheroes tasked with saving the world, but this time it's a lazer, lights and ladies extravaganza. After long, Marvel Studios have come up with a story that is far less complicated, more fun and full of heart as well. While being a fan always helps connect the dots between superhero stories, just watching the three superwomen with interchangeable powers pack a punch, is hugely satisfying. And all of this, while having their share of fun as well. For all practical purposes, it's sort of a sequel to the 2019 installment 'Captain Marvel' that launched Brie Larson into the big league. But this time, Captain Marvel is more human than ever. She is relatable and it's easy to rally behind her character. Larson brings her distinct charm and restraint to this hugely significant role in the MCU, owning every aspect of it. Iman Vellani is quite effortless, as the young and excited teenager, who is living her superhero dream. Marching on with confidence and ease, Vellani seems quite set for her future endeavours in the MCU. However, some of the scenes involving her Indian family featuring Mohan Kapur and Zenobia Shroff as her parents, are slapstick and struggle to evoke humour. Teyonah Parris is impressive as the slightly resentful yet wise Monica Rambeau.The chemistry between the three superwomen is effortless and the highlight of writer-director Nia DaCosta's all women outing. In fact, the film is the strongest when its leading ladies dominate the screen. Zawe Ashton looks a bit gimmicky as Dar-Benn, blunting the seriousness of her villany. Samuel L. Jackson continues to be the ever-dependable Nick Fury despite the fact that his role adds little ammo to this high-octane action extravaganza.The animation besides being convincing is also a whole lot of fun, especially with Goose, Carol Danvers's lovable cat, who is surely not as harmless as a pet feline. 'The Marvels' scores in its runtime as well. None of the scenes drag endlessly and there is definitely more action than talk this time.'The Marvels' triumphs as a dazzling spectacle that seamlessly combines action, heart, and a stellar cast. This one breaks free from the complexity of previous storylines, delivering a refreshing and heartwarming take on superhero narratives, leaving audiences eager for more, especially after those enticing post-credit scenes.","

The Marvels," Too corny and exaggerated acting
",shaunwmccready,18-Jan-24,The quality of this franchise is going down fast. Movies are becoming too corny. The acting is similar to cheesy exaggerated sitcoms. The franchise should review the movies that were successful and how they managed it.Stop leaning so much into the silly and goofy acting and try rebalancing the seriousness of it. Im not sure who's the current target audience but its aimed at the wrong people.Fight scenes in this movie were done poorly. Moves were clearly telegraphed. Scenes with Kamala's family were very cringy. People don't act that way and audiences look for some sort of realism to grasp onto. You want to think maybe some of whats going on is possible. Similar to how Iron man first created his suit and just barely managed to escape. Remember your roots and get back to the good stuff. It all went down hill after End Game.,"

She steals every single scene she's in, and I'm happy to see they seem to have big plans for her with the Young Avengers.On a negative note, I'm not sure what they're doing with Fury's character. We just saw him in an extremely gritty (albeit terrible) show in typical Fury fashion, and now all the sudden he's acting like the weird uncle and appears to have zero knowledge of anything going on? I don't get that. Also, the villain was an easy bottom 3 in MCU history. I wouldn't argue if you said she was the worst.Besides all that, it was a fun movie that didn't try to do too much. There's going to be a TON of haters (clearly) but it definitely is better than all of that.6.2/10.","

The Marvels," Decent movie for free streaming.
",teh_Neo,01-Feb-24,"I wanted to see this in theaters and I'm so happy I didn't waste my money. Cgi isn't bad, had some good moments, mostly thanks to kamala khan the youngest one. Good casting there. Bad casting or writing for literally every other character.I wanted to like it but the story was pointless. Never seemed like anyone was in any trouble except the random alien people that they give almost no backstory nor present story for.The villain was terrible and I dont even know why. Not scary or powerful and seemed corny. Was waiting for the story to draw me in and get connected. Never happened unfortunately. For a free streaming movie, it's ok, but I was expecting more for a marvel movie.","

The Marvels," The dance sequence.........WHY?
",nathanmcdougle,18-Nov-23,"I want to get on my knees with my big glasses and snow cap on and scream into the heavens, I feel like I lost something that's never coming back. Marvel derangement syndrome is real.Now let me begin, The writers of Lost, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and my little pony got together to make a marvel movie; except for one thing.....they didn't invite the writers of the marvel cinematic universe. I thought I was watching an episode of lost because I was completely lost in this disorganized hot mess of a movie. I've been through what, over 20 movies faithfully since the beginning, and this is how I'm rewarded? I will never see another Captain Marvel, I'm sorry the character is flat, emotionless, and I just can't relate. I mean Wonder Woman got it right.....reboot this character or phase it out she serves no purpose.Now this could have been a great movie with the current cast; but someone decided not to develop the characters and I'm sorry I'm not going to watch a TV show to learn about characters in a movie, not gonna happen. So you come in expecting to just know who some of these people are? Confusing as heck, who green lite the crossover from TV and theater platforms?Lastly, let's take the most complex story line for an up and coming ensemble of unknown C list heros and hope they have the talent and backing of the writers and director to pull it off....... NO. They didn't, if it wasn't so ambitions and grandiose they could have pulled this off.You will not get your moneys worth on this....but if you are curious, check it out at your own risk.","

The Marvels," Enjoyable enough, decent humour, Kamala Khan and Brie Larson's bra save the movie from it's weirdness, heavy edits and poor villian.
",wisdomwasp,30-Dec-23,"For one of the first times i came into a Marvle film with low expectations given the performance of its reviews and box office. So given that I enjoyed this film, even despite its flaws.Iman Velleni was a highlight, she seemed to be taking having fun, and was a welcome comic relief. Although for the first half of the film her fangirling of Captain Marvel became old and annoying fast. Her family also had some good humour But again became annoying fast (too much screentime). Brie Larson and Tayona Parris were serviceable with what they had to work with, which wasn't much besides looking pretty and serious most of the time.The short run time was a credit, although movie came as too edited, some scenes too long and some exposition... not enough. Some of the scenes (you'll know which two) were kind of funny but verging on Thor ridiculousness (the bad film).The biggest sin in this film was the villian, probably the worst in MCU history. She did not look like a villian, or act scary like a villian... at all... more suited to a Rom com or something light (with those round cheeks more suited to a support) At least they didn't go in every direction I thought they would, but she needed a touch of evil (see Thor Ragnarok for a good female villian).You can miss this one, but not a waste of your time.","

The Marvels," NGL, I liked it
",ryanjtongue,12-Feb-24,"I am one of the people who's criticised every Marvel film for years. Hell, I criticised Endgame when it came out because it detracted from Infinity War. In an ideal world Disney Marvel would've ended at the blip.But it didn't, and I have admittedly disliked quite a lot of the stuff that's come since due to interpreting it as ""preachy"". Not only does it not make sense, but it also feels like it dislikes me as a viewer, and I felt left out.This film though I didn't feel left out at all. Which is mad considering this film has intentionally stripped people like me out of it all together. Still, somehow, I managed to connect to the character..,, possibly because it's actually written well, and quite funny.Two points actually made me laugh out loud - the part where Fury reacts to Carol falling to the ground, and the part where Carol turns out to be a princess.I have no idea what's different about this film, but for the first time I wasn't left feeling confused and slightly accused, but actually felt like I was understanding roughly what was happening and that the filmmakers wanted me to enjoy the experience.Surprisingly good easy going film. 8/10.","

I wouldn't say it's as terrible as other people say, it just kind of meandered.There were some good bits, it is Marvel after all and I don't think they can make a terrible movie...Miss Marvel has charisma for days.Her family were a joy too.The leads gelled well.Effects were brilliant as everPotentially interesting film as an unexpected consequence from the ending of the first filmA few risks taken (singing?, cat escape pods?)Fury in old skool comedy roleBut these couldn't completely counteract the three big flaws for meI still don't know who Cap Marvel is, except that she seems a bit sadThe structure felt off. I had no idea what the film was about for the first halfThe villain should have been finished off in the first 2 mins such is Cap Marvel's power. But she had plot armour.","

The Marvels," Misses the mark
",johnjsheehan-47195,18-Dec-23,"As a huge marvel fan for many years, I feel more and more disconnect with the franchise since the end of the infinity saga. This was the first film in the series I actively chose not to go to the cinema and watch, and I'm glad I made that choice. It feels like the writers/director weren't aware they were part of a bigger universe. There's barely any connection to secret invasion, which should have been very closely connected given the subject matter. Ms marvel annoyed me throughout the whole film. The dizzy fangirl theme got boring halfway through the TV show, and carrying it on to the film just added to the annoyance. The effects were good in places, then terrible in others. In my opinion marvel needs to refocus on quality instead of quantity.","

The Marvels," Higher. Further. Faster. Together.
",Cinema-reviewer321,16-Jan-24,"I know what people think about the first movie Captain Marvel (2019) and the character Captain Marvel, so that explains some of the bad reviews/hate on this movie, but also, it can be because of how the Marvel Cinematic Universe is performing recently; despite the issues that I noticed while watching, I did find the movie fun and funny, even though it could get a bit stupid at times. The most recent Marvel Studios movie The Marvels (2023) has good performances from the lead actors, the action was fun to watch, the movie was funny, and the CGI, most of the time, is not bad; the movie has issues involving plot holes, some CGI that was obvious, the villain being average, and tone changes from other Marvel Studios movies or shows.I still like Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, and I liked seeing her having to work with Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel to stop a threat that connects to the three of them; though it seems like she should have more emotion in some scenes, she still shows quite a bit when having her working with others and becoming friends. I also still like Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, with her not talking with Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel for a long time and fighting with her against the threat because Monica's powers are entangled with her powers; but she could have had more of a role other than being cool to watch in action scenes and have good on screen chemistry with the other two actors. I enjoyed having Iman Vellani back as Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel because she is a likable character with cool powers who is also a big Captain Marvel fan; other than her getting along great with Carol and Monica and getting to work with her hero Captain Marvel, but it involves the villain having another bangle that is similar to what she has and uses for her powers.The main villain Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton, though it is an ok performance, the villain herself is standard when it comes to her having a reason to attack the main three heroes; she has an interesting backstory that connects to a certain thing that Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel did to her, and she acted like a lesser version of the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) villain Ronan the Accuser. The action sequences are fun with fist fights being well choreographed and using good CGI effects when the main three heroes are using their powers, along with it being cool seeing them switch places during fight scenes; but also, that they work together very well. Also, I want to add that though Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is great and funny, he acts differently than how he was in Marvel's show Secret Invasion (2023-2023); going from being sad and depressed in that show to being funny and lighthearted in the movie somehow.The movie has issues involving how it can have issues involving it wrapping up certain arcs for certain characters quickly and early, along with there being missed opportunities and continuity errors with them setting up a certain thing on a certain planet that is not followed through with; also, there were moments that could be a bit too silly despite there being quite a bit of funny scenes and lines of dialogue. Also, I will say this without major spoilers, but the way the movie ended made me interested in what they are going to do next, but it felt like they could have made the film a little bit longer to make the ending better or they could have done more with certain ideas to make the ending stick better, despite there also being events being wrapped up in a way that could have been done differently.This Marvel Studios movie is going to require you to watch the first Captain Marvel (2019) and the shows WandaVision (2021-2021), Ms. Marvel (2022-2022), and Secret Invasion (2023-2023); since I have seen those, I did understand what the setup for this movie was, but I think the movie should have worked for others who have not seen the first movie or the other shows. The Marvels (2023) is not a perfect Marvel Studios movie, and I understand why people were not a fan of this movie, but I had fun with it and thought it was funny; I know there are key issues with the film, but while you are watching the movie, you do not notice the issues. If you think the Marvel Studios Universe's most recent movies are not as good as their older movies and you are done with Marvel, I understand that, but I am still on board with the Marvel Cinematic Universe because they can still be entertaining and interesting.","

The Marvels," A Good Fun Film
",alindsayal,12-Nov-23,"I think most people can agree that this isn't currently the best time for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and some of their projects haven't got the best responses. The next film to come out under this banner is The Marvels and I saw it the other day and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Captain Marvel get her powers entangled with Kamala Khan & Monica Rambeau forcing them to work together in order to try and save the world.Main Character
Ever since she was cast as Captain Marvel it feels like Brie Larson has received a bunch of unnecessary criticism and I am going to say that I thought she was really good here. It seemed that she was actually having a lot of fun here and she made Carol Danvers a likeable character and one that I actually cared about. She has progressed as a character and the film does a good job in making her less over powered then she has been in previous films.Supporting Characters
I wasn't a huge fan of the Disney+ show Ms Marvel but I can't deny that I really enjoyed Iman Vellani's performance as Kamala Khan in this film. She is a complete fangirl here and she added so much energy to the film and was really fun as part of this larger project.Teyonah Parris reprises her role as Monica Rambeau and I thought she was very good too, she is the most serious of the three characters and the film does an okay job of showing that but Parris sells it well and makes you care about how her character has been affected by other characters actions. The chemistry between these three characters is what carries this film.Samuel L Jackson is once again back in the role of Nick Fury and he is clearly having the blast. The serious character from Secret Invasion is gone and he is here for comedic relief and though that is a little frustrating I can't deny that it was fun watching him here.Zawe Ashton plays the main villain Dar-Benn and she does a decent job, this won't be one of the most memorable MCU villains but I thought the character was pretty well written and Ashton did the best she could with the amount of screen time she had.Story
The story is okay, I think it does a really good job of establishing the three characters in case you haven't seen the Disney+ shows that Kamala & Monica are in. It establishes a bond between the three main characters and the issues that concern them, they also give the villain an interesting motivation that makes some sense. But the issue is that none of it is developed enough, it feels a bit rushed and like certain arcs aren't given enough time to shine and that holds the film back a bit.Script
The script is also just okay. There is some pretty good humour and some moments of conflict that hit hard but there just isn't quite enough. It doesn't take many gambles and is quite generic which leaves it a little short.Style
The film looks pretty good it avoids the CGI issues of some previous MCU films and has some fun action sequences that due to some certain story choices allows for some real creativity. It's more of a pacing issue that the film has, it takes a bit of time to get going and then seems to rush at other times which makes it a little jarring.Overall
Overall, The Marvels is a good fun film. It will not save the MCU but it is a quick and easy fun film to go see, I think the reviews have been pretty harsh and I think it is worth a viewing especially for comic book fans.Rating - 7/10.","

The Marvels," A Disappointing Marvel: The Marvels Movie Falls Flat
",Cedric333333,11-Nov-23,"A Disappointing Marvel: The Marvels Movie Falls FlatAs an avid fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I was eagerly anticipating the release of ""The Marvels."" However, after watching the movie, I can't help but feel thoroughly disappointed. It pains me to say it, but ""The Marvels"" fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors and falls flat in numerous areas.One of the biggest issues with the film is its lackluster storytelling. The plot feels convoluted and disjointed, making it difficult to get invested in the narrative. The movie attempts to juggle multiple storylines and characters, but it fails to give each one the attention they deserve. As a result, the pacing feels rushed, and the audience is left feeling disconnected from the characters and their motivations.Furthermore, the characterization in ""The Marvels"" is a missed opportunity. The film introduces new characters, but they lack depth and development. They feel like mere placeholders, with no real substance or memorable qualities. Even the returning characters from previous films seem to be stuck in a state of stagnation, with little growth or evolution.One of the strengths of Marvel movies has always been their ability to strike a balance between action and character-driven moments. Sadly, ""The Marvels"" leans heavily towards mindless action sequences at the expense of meaningful character interactions. The action scenes, while visually impressive, lack emotional weight and become repetitive after a while. It feels like a spectacle for the sake of a spectacle, without any real purpose or impact on the overall story.Another major disappointment is the film's direction and cinematography. The visual style lacks the innovation and creativity that we have come to expect from Marvel films. The cinematography feels uninspired, with generic framing and lackluster shot compositions. The director fails to create any truly memorable or visually stunning moments, which is a missed opportunity given the vast potential of the Marvel universe.Furthermore, the humor in ""The Marvels"" falls flat. Marvel movies have been known for their clever and witty humor, but this film's attempts at comedy feel forced and contrived. The jokes often miss the mark and elicit little more than a polite chuckle, failing to land with the impact and timing that we have come to expect.Overall, ""The Marvels"" is a lackluster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its weak storytelling, underdeveloped characters, excessive focus on action, uninspired direction, and lackluster humor all contribute to a disappointing movie experience. As a fan, I had hoped for so much more from this film, but sadly, it fails to deliver on its promises.","

Personally I think this whole endeavour was a waste of time and money by the studio. Did they not look at how interested people were in Miss Marvel and Monica Rambeau from the shows?Everything about this felt a bit on par with the second or third 'Spy Kids' films.","

The Marvels," I loved it
",cynvanity,13-Nov-23,"This recent superhero film pleasantly surprised me with its engaging content throughout. Unlike other lengthy films in its franchise, this one struck a perfect balance in duration. The dynamic trio at the center of the story showcased exceptional chemistry, both when together and individually. Their scenes packed with exhilarating action, including body-switching sequences, were impressively executed.The film excelled in blending humor, fun, and fast-paced action. Its straightforward narrative is appreciable and accessible even for those not deeply familiar with the franchise's previous installments.A notable highlight was the portrayal of the youthful protagonist, Kamala, whose vibrancy and energy, along with her family's depiction, added a fresh dimension to the story. The adorable cats featured in the film also added a charming touch.Furthermore, the end credits scene was particularly thrilling, setting an exciting tone for future developments in the series.","

The Marvels," Better Than Expected Despite Obvious Flaws
",ta-98251,26-Nov-23,"Despite my low expectations, The Marvels was an enjoyable watch for two main reasons. First, the dynamic between the leads. I wasn't sure if they could carry the film but Ms Marvel, Monica Rambeau and Captain Marvel had good on screen chemistry and the movie massively benefited from having all three of them around.Secondly, it felt slightly different to other Marvel Films. We had three female protagonist who had their own personal and interwoven issues and desires. There was heart to the characters and their individual development and relationship was a lot more interesting than the overarching story which wasn't ground breaking but it managed to serve its purpose notwithstanding a terrible villain. We also saw some unique action sequences. Whilst the likes of Black Widow, Thor Love & Thunder and Eternals tried to do a lot and fell short, the Marvels knew its lane and experimented within it. We even saw new communities that communicated through song. This immediately gave me heart palpitations for Joker 2 but it was nice to see Marvel try something different.Overall, I went into this with the lowest of expectations but surprisingly and maybe in part due to my expectations, I ended up having a fun and somewhat heartfelt time. And there is also the little matter of the post credit scene...","

The characters were funny and likeable. I got exactly what I want from this film. It certainly rates a lot higher with me than Quantummania and The Eternals. It's a decent watch, so much so I'd watch it again. Bri Larson did a nice job. It was nice to see Nick Fury back to his normal character after how horrible secret invasion was.

When it comes to the score, I gladly give The Marvels 8 out of 10.","

Just great!I wasn't a huge fan of Ms Marvel but she (and her family) is pretty good in this film as well.Like the 'you never came back' story of why Monica was so annoyed with Carol in this (and WandaVision). She didn't really have much to do in the film though, which was a shame.The story could have been better told, I think. I was a bit lost at first as to the purpose of the jump points and how they all got to switching places.Questions:
It seems daft that 3 superheroes (including Captain Marvel, I might add) couldn't pretty easily take down this one baddie?Didn't understand how all these 'Goose' eggs appeared all over the ship at the same time?If the rip in space was made by clashing together the two bracelets then why couldn't that seal it again?Was it just convenience that meant the rip had to be sealed from the inside?

The Marvels," Shallow as a tasty horsoderve tray.
",adaringdo-1,09-Nov-23,"I mean the story line was almost invisible, except to showcase new characters who were underdeveloped yet super powerful with little to no explanation.The filming, action, and characters were ""active and diverse"", although it had zero central white actors... so how is this diverse again? Not that it would matter if the story was good, crafted, and easy to follow, but it wasn't.The women were all KARENS, especially the kid who, although repeatedly saying she was confused always seemed to best everyone, beat the foes, and save the day showing powers as proficient as any highly trained superhero.I was confused from the beginning since there was no actual in-story character development, or obvious goal shown. Oh, they said there was a goal... because they never showed it.The evil villain wasn't a villain at all, just a misunderstood woman king who didn't know how to rule or communicate.The powerful weapons were just eye-toys to advance a confusing story line that eventually was pointless since the final revelation had little to do with the material between the beginning and the end. You could have jumped from the first plot point to the last without losing anything important.There was a cute factor, but no attempt to explore any deep meanings, actually visually explain events, or develop empathy with the characters. Nick Furry was just an add on decoration who made no real contribution to the story.Over all: Some good action events, a few funny lines, some fake emotions, and several really bad camera cuts, jumps, and story nonsense. Some people will enjoy this, but most will leave disappointed at how shallow and pointless the journey was.","

The Marvels," What's With The Negativities?
",cahidi,27-Jan-24,"I have heard a LOT of people complaining that this is the worst Marvel movie ever. As someone who has zero expectation, I watched it like a novice. Well, not exactly novice, since I've watched Captain Marvel, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel. All prerequisites for watching this movie. Well, not exactly, but you'll get a much better understanding of this movie if you've watched all three of them. And after watching this movie till the end, I must ask, ""What's with the negativities?"". Cause I didn't see anything bad about the movie. If you're talking about how the super villain is so plain, well that tends to happen when you've seen so many super villains before this. They all kinda look the same. I think story wise, this movie has a very unique and interesting plot. I like the switching glitch of the trio heroines. It's funny and sometimes fatally dangerous. And seeing Kamala Khan freaking out after meeting her idol is cute. And Monica's reunion with Carol is touching. Also that mid and post credit scenes are promising a new refreshing sequels. Honestly, what are y'all complaining about? The worst Marvel movie my a$$! To me, the worst one is still Black Widow. It always will be... hopefully. From this moment I hope it will only get better.","

",jacksongaming-80094,09-Nov-23,"The Marvels present a lot of ideas that on paper lays the foundation for a strong charecter driven sequel, but it's ""action-over-charecter"" approach boggs it down to another unmemorable and unsatisfiying entry to the MCU.The movie peaks in its opening 20 mins where the director plays with the charecter-swapping mechanism to set up some uniquely choreographed and exciting action sequences, with a few iffy CGI moments.The chemistry between the main 3 leads, with Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel (undoubtedly the best part of the film, she is an absolute gem) at centre of it, is the heart and soul of the film, but the overarching narrative that surrounds them feels rushed, repeative and messy.The villain is it's weakest aspect - has a great motive, but extremely underdeveloped and generic. Emotionally heavy scenes are cut short, that results in the point being made but not hammered home. It has an exciting post credit scene, so do stay for that.","

All the characters are very likeable Kamala and her family being the standouts, the action is some of the best post endgame, the visuals are really strong and the camera movement was really well done. The villain although weak and forgettable actually had good motivations and the story was simple anyone who says it's too messy or doesn't make sense must be a bit daft because it was thin but very obvious. In short the marvels is short and sweet and if you're in the mood to have fun at the cinema this is the film to see.","

The Marvels," Lazy writing with fun graphics!
",johnyi-61184,14-Feb-24,"No wonder this movie has a bad rating lol
It's irrelevant story with a lazy writing~ I guess the writers at MCU went on strike earlier!Good graphics with light comedic mood that is consistent with the Marvel series. MCU is becoming more lazier with their storytelling, not focusing on the detail.I mean, Captain Marvel saved Hala in few seconds which she should've done it 30 years ago~ lol 🤣Overall, it feels like a continuation of the Ms. Marvel series which has no deep relevant story, and one can skip this movie without any consequences to the whole MCU timeline. It totally feels like an isolated incident..","

The Marvels," Hodgepodge
",Zettelhead,21-Jan-24,"What the...? Is this really a marvel movie or a satire on marvel movies? They really threw everything into it. Some of the ideas are great but some of them are just terrible and nothing fits together.There are some very funny moments and the cast is great. But on the other side the dramatic backstory why Cpt. Marvel is called ""Annihilator"" is just wasted completely. There could have been some serious character developement but instead of using that fatal mistake of her for pushing the story ahead, we have to watch 10 minutes of Brie Larson starring in a cheesy musical. And that really was one of my worst movie experiences ever.Hey, you there at Disney: Release Brie Larson from the devilish contract that she will be able to play in good movies again. Such a waste of talent!!!","

The Marvels," A pleasant fairytale sequel to the first film from the studio MARVEL.
",anonim-73883,24-Nov-23,"Opinion on «The Marvels (2023):I'll start with the fact that in March 2019, the first part of «Captain Marvel» was released in theaters, and this same year I went and watched it in the theater with my mother, godfather and his sons.At the time, I liked this film, although I still think it's great.I started looking forward to the second part in 2021, and the movie finally hit the big screens.I went and saw this movie in the cinema and what can I say about it?«The Marvels» - is a pleasant fairytale sequel to the first film from the studio MARVEL.It's a great, interesting, light movie to rest and relax.Plot-wise, the film does not present us with anything new, but it was not boring to watch and is quite interesting.The 105-minute running time passed easily, quickly and unnoticed.The graphics and visuals were pretty good and much better than in «Quantumania».I liked the cast. Brie Larson played well and was very beautiful, as always.Iman Vellani as Kamala and Teyonah Parris as Monica were all good too.Samuel L. Jackson is as good as Nick Fury as usual.The rest of the cast also did well.I liked the soundtrack, but I would like to mention ""Intergalactic"" by the Beastie Boys and the song ""RATATA"" by Skrillex, Missy Elliott and Mr. Oizo.As a result, «The Marvels» - is not the best film of the studio MARVEL, but not the worst either.My two-year expectations from the film were met and I do not regret the time spent and the 700 rubles spent on watching this film in the cinema at 3D Format.I give the film an 8.5 - 9 out of 10 and recommend going to the cinema to see it.","

The Marvels," Higher further faster
",alexbazelos,11-Nov-23,"The last movie of 2023
New team in MCU. Perhaps the most badly reviewed movie before it even came out just from the trailers. Of all the recent Marvel movies, this is probably the one that bored me a little more. I'm not saying it wasn't watchable I'm just saying it was a very average movie.I loved the connection and chemistry between the Marvels as well as the combination of their powers in the fight scenes. Of course, in some scenes it was as if I was watching a Disney musical
you will understand what i mean
For me, we may be dealing with one of the most uninteresting villains in this film, although I liked the performance of the actress who embodies this character
Overall The Marvels is just a good movie

The Marvels," The Cats Stole The Show
",Pairic,15-Nov-23,"The Marvels: At times the trio act like The Simpsons or maybe The Three Stooges but supply as many laughs as both of those in their prime. Well. It's all Carol Danvers' fault, after she destroyed rhe Supreme Intelligence, the Kree have a civil war which ecologically wrecks their home planet Hala and damages their sun (we learn this at the start). Dar-Benn, the new leader of the Kree, retrieves one of the Quantum Bands, of which Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) has the other half. Dar-Benn harnesses the power of the Band to tear open a jump point in space. This causes damage The resulting anomaly is investigated by from separate sides by Monica Rambeau and Carol Danvers. When Rambeau touches the anomaly, she, Danvers, and Kamala switch places through teleportation. The switching causes the three to fight each others' Kree enemies. This results in some slapstick comedy scenes which also advance the narrative. How will they sort this out? Nick Fury is involved as well, so is the lovable cat who sprouts tentacles from his mouth and swallows the Kree leader's henchmen and many kittens appear.. The Skrull once again have to be rescued by the trio and Danvers learns lessons about her Great White Saviour Complex. We even get a planet where the inhabitants communicate through song, colourfully dressed like aliens from STOS or early episodes of STNG. Some great battle scenes and one to combat, all delivers with a soupcon of humour. Not the greatest of the Marvel films (this is the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)). But well worth watching. Directed by Nia DaCosta, who co-wrote the screenplay with Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik. 7.5/10.","

The Marvels," Blends Teamwork, Girl Power, Comedy And Emotion With Action-Adventure And Positive Themes
",rannynm,14-Nov-23,"While it is far from perfect, The Marvels is a captivating film filled with adventure and laughter. It has unexpected twists and turns around every corner that help make it an entertaining movie.The Marvels centers around members of the Avengers. Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), better known as Captain Marvel, has found herself and her superpowers linked with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and new teenage superhero Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), aka Miss Marvel. These three powerful women must team up to stop Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the ruler of a struggling civilization who has set her eyes on taking resources from thriving planets. However many secrets about Carol's past resurface as they do so.Iman Vellani's performance as Kamala Khan overpowers the movie with a new side of joy to the MCU. Her explosive personality bursts through the screen as a huge highlight throughout the entire film. I love her character as she brings it to life with a passion. There are so many insane plot twists throughout the film and, while most are a great addition to the plot, a few get a little too crazy for my liking; though they aren't wild enough to drag the movie down. I enjoyed the plot being based around three strong women who are in charge. It's something not seen as often in superhero movies, especially in the past, but the MCU has been doing it a lot recently and it's very empowering. My favorite part of the movie is towards the beginning when Monica, Kamala and Carol first discover their powers have been entangled and they find themselves fighting soldiers in three different places and switching back and forth between locations throughout the battle. It's super fun to watch and my eyes were glued to the screen.The message of The Marvels is that true friends and family will love you and always be there for you no matter what. Carol learns this throughout the movie as she sometimes worries about what the people who care for her will think about her past; eventually, she accepts that they will love her for who she is now and not what she's done before.I give The Marvels 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. It releases in theaters November 10, 2023.By Kendall B., KIDS FIRST!","

The Marvels," May have earned Marvel a brief stay of execution from Martin Scorsese
",DarthVoorhees,12-Nov-23,"No one was more prepared to hate 'The Marvels' than I was. I have vehemently agreed with every complaint and critique leveled at the MCU for years. Individually I've liked and even loved some entries but as a cohesive whole the MCU has brought moviegoing to cynical cashgprabbing and story telling lows. Post-'Endgame' has been a real chore and with the MCU on the ropes and having hated the last four or five films I was sure there would be nothing to like in 'The Marvels' when I was brought with to see it.Well, I ate some humble pie. 'The Marvels' is an interesting film to dissect because in truth it doesn't do much right. Those MCU problems are all still there...(in fact this might be the absolute worst in being a commercial for half realized properties) and it has a horribly dull villain who is evil for the sake of evil. The drama is all contrived as well.And despite that you cannot deny that 'The Marvels' has a distinct personality of its own. The worlds visited are all very unique and don't mimic the grey Russo Brothers look of 'Captain America Winter Solider' that nine out of ten Marvel films have in the past decade. The idea of the singing planet is very funny and shockingly irreverent for a Marvel film. The sequence with the Flerkens is equal parts gross and cute which is a great combination. So in a movie with a mercifully short runtime I ended up smiling a lot between some moments of groaning.But let's be honest what elevates 'The Marvels' is the performance from Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel. She is charming and funny and steals every scene she is in(and Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris are no slouches either). I know the bar is low but Vellani injects a sense of fun and wonder into Khan that is infectious especially compared to someone like MCU veteran Samuel L Jackson who has stretches where he seems like he is sleepwalking through the material. The true testament to how much I liked Vellani's performance is that she is given a cringe sequel set-up that she is able to make genuinely hilarious despite the fact I hate sequel set ups.The Titanic that is the MCU is still sinking but 'The Marvels' is a banger rendition of 'Nearer My God to Thee.'","

Barbie," An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun
",zkonedog,01-Aug-23,"For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.For a very basic overview, ""Barbie"" sees its titular character (played by Margot Robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in Barbieland. Well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to figure out what is going on. As it turns out, a rift has developed between Barbieland and the real world that only Stereotypical Barbie--accompanied by Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)--can mend. But when Barbie & Ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.In terms of plot, somehow Gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with ""Barbie"". A mere mention of the term ""patriarchy"" in today's polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet Gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. Much like, say, Jordan Peele before her did with horror flicks like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", Gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. Sometimes, that proves to be the best ""delivery service"" and it is certainly true in this case.Of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film's shenanigans and softer moments, and ""Barbie"" comes up aces in that department too. Robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film's own dual nature. But more often than not it is Gosling who steals the show every time he's on screen. To do what Gerwig wants to do with ""Barbie"", the Ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of Gosling (one of Hollywood's most underappreciated acting talents). The rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.""Barbie"" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn't short the area of pink paint for no reason. DP Rodrigo Pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. All of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and even Gosling himself!Not only do I feel that ""Barbie"" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like ""The Flash"", ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 1"", & ""Oppenheimer"", but it subsequently vaulted Gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside Nolan, Villeneuve, Peele, etc.). After not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, I was utterly blown away by this experience.","

Barbie," Could be better
",popyoshi-36312,06-Nov-23,"Completely forgot to review this, the sets are easily the best they're really gorgeous to look at, the characters are fun to watch and the characters are all really enjoyable. The movie gets a bit preachy but only for one scene, I also think the movie is slightly contradictive as every male character is treated as dumb and arrogant despite them promoting equality. It's done for jokes though so I know it's not meant to be an actual message with the humour, I just think it weakens the messaging of the film, it's still a really really good film the ending is super sweet and meaningful and overall it's a great movie especially considering this is a movie about barbie dolls lmao, I personally didn't find it to funny but I still appreciate it for its charm and most of its storytelling.","

Barbie," ""Barbie"" - A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity, Consumerism, and Existentialism
",andypaps101,19-Jul-23,"I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.","

Barbie," Amazing Cast & Set, but the political message was too strong
",fscsgxp,20-Jul-23,"I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..","

Barbie," The best version of itself
",masonsaul,21-Jul-23,"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.","

Barbie," I would have preferred to see this as a 30 minute TV sitcom
",Ed-Shullivan,27-Dec-23,"Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various Ken's we agreed that Ryan Gosling appeared to be the main character and not Barbie.Don't get me wrong, both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of Ken and Barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the Ryan Gosling ""Ken doll"" with an enhanced CGI eight (8) pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for Ryan Gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through Barbie's vision of the changing world.The visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the 1960's Elvis films such as Blue Hawaii since Barbie and Elvis were popular icons within the same era. The downside of the Barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male Ken dolls.All in all it was a decent film, not to be considered a future film classic, nor a memorable Ryan Goslng or Margot Robbie performance worthy of an Academy Award but just like Barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era. It would not surprise me to see a TV producer turn this Barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly 30 minute TV sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold Mrs. Shullivan and my own attention for.I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 IMDb rating.","

Barbie," Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one
",Dello_,25-Jul-23,"I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity:
* some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn't like it I'd suggest you to watch ""Barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!","

What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast.

Barbie," Good...not great
",planktonrules,29-Jul-23,"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.","

Barbie," A triumph of marketing for a poorly realised story
",stusby,14-Aug-23,"It's weird seeing a movie that puts gay male culture front and centre of a lesbian-free world.This highlights the movie's sloppy construction, it doesn't know what it wants to be.The movie starts with a homage to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey resulting in every child rejecting baby dolls. What started out as amusing is so committed to a shot-for-shot homage it becomes a sinister, disturbing message that closely matches 2001's statement of the human race discovering weapons.A chase scene in an office makes no sense.A key character at her kitchen table is a touching moment but the way she is found has no internal logic.Having seen this film with various friends I noticed audiences were left cold at same points.Why would Ken run into plastic moulded waves in an environment he lives in? One of many 'jokes' that fails to land such as the cartoon car crashes, the boardroom whisper gag among others.The movie has some cute moments having people enact doll play.That absence of internal logic reveals this movie has no idea what it wants to be.","

Barbie," I don't see how it was preachy
",thePopcornExplorer,04-Aug-23,"In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.So let's start with the actual review, Greta Gerwig seems to have found an actual legitimate story for the type of message she delivered, contrary to most criticism I didn't find the movie preachy or biased at all, I actually felt it was incredibly balanced and the message made sense considering the plot. Sometimes I do agree that these (for some reason) delicate social topics tend to be pushed into films because a lot of studio directors want to align with trends to make a few more dollars, but in this particular film I didn't felt that at all!It's a fictional story that has the ability to tell a bit of historical context of one of the most (if not the most) famous dolls in the world and how it impacted the world culture and how it actually affected women's image with its controversial decisions.The other aspect of this fictional story is providing perspective, of how women are perceived and treated in our society, the rooted systemic issues we tend to ignore AND with the Barbie plot device provide some fun and interesting analogy of how society would be if it was the other way around and women were the ones holding most power.But again there's no hidden dark meaning, it's just a woman's perspective and if you think about it, even though reality change a lot considering the country where you live, it's not that ridiculous, the story is ultimately about equality and its a fun innocent approach to it.Margot Robbie is insanely talented and its amazing to watch her portray this role, for once I am hoping that we keep the dialogue opened and stop inventing false theories .","

Barbie," No Direction
",andermic18,21-Jul-23,"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.","

Barbie," Didn't hit my pink spot
",tm-sheehan,19-Jul-23,"My Review - Barbie
In Cinemas now
My Rating 6.5/10I've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I'm a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig's work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I'd love it or a huge disappointment and I'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that's not the case I didn't love it and I didn't loathe it I have to accept that I
just didn't get it ?Perhaps it's because that I'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken's behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it's popular for the creators of the movie I'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric's 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying ""that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences ""the thing you didn't know you wanted.I'm not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn't reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn't know I wanted wasn't what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named ""Techni-Barbie,"" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,","

Barbie," I am Kenough
",eoinageary,23-Jul-23,"So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8/10.","

There's nobody really in the middle on this film, the reaction is so wide spread.I thought it was fine, I thought it was a nice broad comedy that we don't always have these days.

Barbie," Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling's performances bolster a film with messaging that is heavy-handed and bordering on exhaustingly preachy most of the time
",ambusched94,13-Sep-23,"The film opens strongly with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering compelling performances. Their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie. However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable. Some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message, as the film can be seen as overly direct, leading to a polarizing and preachy tone. This approach aligns with the directorial style and screenplay motifs commonly associated with Greta Gerwig.The production design of Barbie Land is visually captivating, offering a feast for the eyes. The music soundtrack, featuring a standout disco track by Dua Lipa, complements the film well. Dua Lipa's cameo as Mermaid Barbie is a highlight.The film incorporates satire and self-aware humor, which adds depth to the story. However, the humor doesn't consistently land, and some moments feel forced. The character Stereotypical Ken provides sporadic moments of humor.In summary, 'Barbie' is a film worth watching at least once. It includes an empowerment monologue delivered by America Ferrera's character, addressing societal expectations placed on women. While there is still some double standard in gender role expectations, it is less prominent in today's society compared to the past. Anyway, an overhyped film from 2023 that I wouldn't watch again.","

I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is ""The Barbie"" isn't so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator.

I have to admit, as a man, I really enjoyed that movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and really innovative, because there aren't any other movies similar to this one. The storyline was very well written, well-explained and it's concept was definitely something original. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The filming locations of the movie were mainly, barbie land and the real world. The casting was really good and their acting was descent, everyone portrayed their characters really well. The opening scene was definitely unpredictable, very promising and I really liked it. The ending scene was kinda unpredictable and it was hilarious, I definitely enjoyed it.

Barbie," Misleading.
",GhostFoxX,24-Jul-23,"I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.","

",sandy777,21-Nov-23,"Barbie, a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends, what could go wrong? A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.","

Barbie," serious Barbie
",ferguson-6,30-Jul-23,"BARBIE (2023)
Greetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.Ms. Gerwig co-wrote the screenplay with her real-life spouse and fellow filmmaker, Noah Baumbach (MARRIAGE STORY, 2019), and it's fascinating to see what they have produced. Whether you find the film entertaining is another matter altogether, yet we tip our cap to the strange, visually-stimulating, and thought-provoking end result. Many will go in-depth on analyzing the gender politics and feminist approach to the story; however, I'm just here to discuss this as a movie, not a movement.Two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie stuns in the opening sequence (a tribute to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) as the original 1959 Barbie. In fact, Ms. Robbie is terrific throughout in this more-challenging-than-expected role. She's so much more than a pretty face in high heels, as she's previously proven in a risk-taking career featuring memorable turns in such films as THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), SUICIDE SQUAD (2016), I, TONYA (2017), as Sharon Tate in ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (2019), and last year's underappreciated BABYLON (2022). This time she portrays 'Stereotypical' Barbie, whose everyday is perfect in Barbieland. It's here where we meet a diverse group of Barbies featuring Issa Rae, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lip, and others. We are also introduced to Ken (two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling, terrific here), whose mood for the day is totally dependent on whether Barbie acknowledges him. An equally diverse group of Kens features Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena, Ncuti Gatwa, and others.Barbie's paradise is rocked one day when she begins wondering about death. A trip to ""Weird Barbie"" (a kooky Kate McKinnon) lets her know that the only cure for this existential crisis is a visit to the human world, where a sad girl is playing with her doll. It's really an imaginative hook to allow the two worlds to collide. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of the human world clicked for me (loved the rollerblading at Venice Beach). It makes sense that Barbie is shocked to discover the misogyny and patriarchy ruling the human world, but there are three other elements at play here: Ken discovering that men don't take a backseat to women in this world, and in fact, they dominate; the corporate office of Mattel plays like a slapstick cartoon with Will Ferrell as a nonsensical CEO; and the mother-daughter duo of America Ferrera as Gloria and Ariana Greenblat as Sasha. The big twist occurs in that latter sequence, and it's Ms. Ferrera who dishes out the gut punch soliloquy about what's expected of women and how they are viewed. This monologue is the lesson director Gerwig wants viewers to leave with.Barbie's return to a much-changed Barbieland finds Ken and other Kens treating the Dreamhouse like a Frat house. See, the boys have learned how to run things their way ... and at its core, that's my main issue with the movie's theme. Empowering women is a good thing, but why did Ms. Gerwig feel the need to make everything either a win for the women or a win for the men? I have always thought equality was the goal, not dominance. It's this approach that gives the film a serious and dark undertone in a quite heavy-handed manner. Sure women enjoy having power. So do men. That's no great mystery solved, and in fact makes these obvious points somehow more obvious.Let's talk about a few other less ominous topics. Helen Mirren delivers an admirable voiceover as the narrator, and a depressed Barbie and Ken's affinity for horses are nice touches. Two of my favorite segments are Barbie's first interaction in the human world ... a ""beautiful"" woman on a park bench played by Oscar winner Ann Roth (a renowned Costume Designer who did not handle the costumes for this film), and a conversation with Barbie inventor Ruth Handler (played by Rhea Perlman), who named the doll after her daughter. While I hold firm on my belief that the film is not especially entertaining/fun, I'll also admit the song and dance around the ""I'm Just Ken"" number was a hoot. Other than performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the star here is the Production Design from six-time Oscar nominee Sarah Greenwood. The film looks amazing, even if you might get your fill of pink by the end. Barbieland is quite a sight - it's a shame the rest of the movie didn't deliver this much fun, and instead pitted men against women.","

Barbie," A lot of fun....
",brockfal,15-Dec-23,"Firstly, let's just say that I am not in the ideal demographic for 'Barbie', being male, 66 years old, and I don't have children, so it's taken me a while to get to this film. Anyway, what a lot of fun this film is. The concept works brilliantly and it's all carried through with self effacing charm and humour that both wins you over from the start , opening wonderfully with a parody of 2001, and then keeps you engaged throughout. Margot Robbie is perfect in the lead and Ryan Gossling couldn't be better as Ken (or one of the many Ken's), and the whole thing chugs along effortlessly and humorously. The idea of the conflict between the wonderfully created female world of Barbieland and the male dominated real world is milked for all it can give, with director Greta Gerwig hardly missing a trick. On so many levels this is a clever and tremendously entertaining film and I really loved it - even an old guy like me....","

Barbie," A sheer pleasure to watch.
",adamjohns-42575,10-Aug-23,"Barbie (2023) -*I wrote this review about three times and I'm afraid it's still a bit of a ramble.I didn't go in to watching this expecting it to amaze me, but to only provide a few basic giggles. I suppose I'd thought that it would be too juvenile and aimed at teens and tweens, but actually it was very good and the more I recalled of it, the more I wanted to see it again.There was so much nostalgia throughout this film, even for me as a gay man, who as a child learned that he needed to catch his sister in a good mood if he wanted to play Barbie with her and ultimately ended up playing with his 'Star Wars' figures a lot instead.The little touches and the interesting special editions of the doll that popped up throughout were cleverly used and some of them easy to remember from trips to the toy shop and the times that I used to sneak in to my sisters room to play with her collection whilst she was out.Add to that a great deal of humour in various styles and it would be hard for even the most masculine, anti-feminist not to find something to laugh at in this film, despite the fact that it took the mick out of men in general.Yes it did make a point of empowering women of all backgrounds, which it was always going to do, but I felt that it did it without making such a harsh attack on men that the average male would feel threatened by it or take the jokes with anything but a pinch of salt and there is always the hope that some people would learn from it.Essentially it was just parodying the way that women have been treated over the years and showing that treatment up for the stupid behaviour that it was and sadly still is by exploring how a matriarchy might effect men and the ways that they might react.The general production of the film came across like a cross between 'Elf' (2003), 'The Lego Movie' (2014), 'Big' (1988) and so many others of that oeuvre.All of it, but specifically Barbieland was brilliantly designed and constructed, colourful and fun, with a great soundtrack and some real laugh out loud moments, a lot of which were quite adult. And while the majority of those jokes might go over the heads of a younger audience, I could see why it was given a 12 rating. The adventure had an emotional depth that might not grip younger kids.With regards to the cast, Margot Robbie was great in her role of stereotypical Barbie. I loved the scene where ""Ugly Betty"" (America Ferrera as Gloria) was applying Margot's make up as it seemed so ironic, but I'm afraid that Barb's leading man Ken really stole the limelight, especially with his song ""I'm Just Ken"", which has featured very heavily on my iTunes lately.Ryan Gosling was superb as the plasticised blonde and blue eyed man, although at times I wasn't sure whether his toned abs might not actually be a plastic prosthetic, because they weren't totally natural looking.However, I think that I've found a new appreciation for Ryan after the disaster that was 'La La Land' (2016), because he was just so good in this role. It was another irony that he stood out so much in a film about Barbie, which repeatedly referred to Ken as just an accessory.I also loved Rhea Perlman in her casting. The usually brassy little lady seemed perfect in her role and I thought that she could have performed Helen Mirren's Narrator part as well, because, for the amount Helen actually said, it didn't really need another celebrity and Rhea's character would have leant itself to the voiceover easily.""Weird"" Barbie, the doll who was played with too much, performed by Kate McKinnon was fantastic and an absolutely great addition to the story.I also liked Michael Cera's character Allan, it wasn't anything very new for him, but delivered a different kind of comic relief with his subtlety and non presence.I did however feel that Will Ferrell had some typical Ferrell moments that were a bit daft and could have been left out, but in the end even he was appropriate in his part of the ditsy Mattel CEO as well.There really was an amalgamation of comedic stylings, which I felt would make it appealing to almost anyone.I'm not sure that I caught all of the cameos dotted throughout, but there were some definite surprises and I looked forward to trying to spot them all when I saw it again.I did notice that there was a lot of British actors among the cast though. At least three of them were from the TV series 'Sex Education' (2019-23).Not that I'm saying that all those Brits were a bad thing, but it was odd that they were mostly playing Americans. I would assume that a lot of it was filmed in the UK, making it easier to use them.Ultimately I enjoyed the inclusion of all of the British cast, 3 of whom that I've had the pleasure to work with myself.I specifically liked Connor Swindells as Aaron Dinkins. After his roles in 'Sex Education' and 'SAS: Rogue Heroes' (2022-) I felt that this was yet another example of his diversity.And on the topic of diversity, I really appreciated that people from all walks of life were represented in the film, but not made a fuss of or shoved in my face to prove a point that the film and Barbieland was an educated place. I spotted the Wheelchair Barbie amongst the rest, but they didn't include her in the story just to tick a box and I was glad of that, because I'm tired of films trying too hard to be politically correct and compromising the end result to achieve it. That doesn't mean that I wouldn't have been happy to see her play a key role if it had been relevant to the story of course.On my second viewing of this one I felt that there was also a more subtle message about not taking people for granted and another about the fact that you can't stop things from changing. I think it was those ideas that mellowed out the overall strong female empowerment and equal rights message that rightly seemed to be the primary element of the film, because you couldn't help but feel for Ken, whilst also empathising with Barbie.I also remembered that I had thought the end montage to be somewhat lacking in power and I think that was due to the clarity and rush of the images that went by. I would have liked it to have been a bit brighter and certainly visually clearer.As a whole though it was a real pleasure to watch and left me with a smile on my face. I'm pretty sure that I will end up with it on DVD, because it was one of those films that will always make me feel a joy to watch, which I believe the world needs more of.838.49/1000.","

But, as I've had time to sit with this one, I can't help but feel my opinion on it... Diminishing.Let's start on the positive though. This movie is fun. A lot of fun. It's funny, clever and it's trying to get a message across. The actors are all doing a fine job and while I might not have personally thought them to be perfectly cast, that doesn't take away from the fine job that they all did.Beyond the superficial though, I think this movie starts to suffer the more and more I dig into it. I think the pacing is just a bit off. It's either going too slow or too fast, most of the time, not necessarily to a tremendous degree, but certainly a noticeable one. Then there's the whole message of the movie, which is certainly important but is something that feels like it just came too late. I don't know that we need this particular take on sex and gender roles right now. Again, not because it's not relevant, but because other things have beat this to the finish line and frankly, done it better. This is like swinging through a McDonalds to get a Barbie pink strawberry shake after having had a delicious meal already. Sure it's fun, but it's largely pointless. It's the fluff following the real deal. That's not exactly a dealbreaker, but for a film that spends so much of its time and energy on certain things, it definitely felt diminished by the fact that its really just retreading ground already walked, albeit in a shinier package. Between that and the runaway hype train on this, all the controversy and coverage it's gotten, it's hard to not walk away from this and feeling a bit disappointed.Again, fun movie. Enjoyable movie for the most part even. It feels very much like something with superficial popularity though. Yes, it's being talked about, it's in the conversation and people are paying attention to it now but I have a very hard time imagining this having the same kind of lasting impact as other films might. And maybe that's not what it's trying to do, maybe I'm prescribing too much meaning to it, that could very well be true. But, for a movie so focused on certain things, it's hard not to draw those conclusions.","

Barbie," How is this movie so popular?
",tommy-97761,13-Sep-23,"I realise that I am hardly the target audience of this movie, but even so, slogging trough the movie I am baffled as to what the appeal is? There must be something with all the money it made at the box office, right? I haven't read any other reviews yet so as not to spoil my own impression of the movie.I've waited for the home release and I will admit, I fell asleep a couple times and am not compelled at all to rewatch the movie any time soon.There are some visual gags and some good jokes but I felt like those kind of ran out in the first 20 minutes or so. Once you get pass the novelty of the movie, what else is there? Not much in my opinion. The only thing that could hold my interest was Ken and his subplot, but the things happening around and to Barbie I couldn't care less about. The movie didn't make me care at all about anything that happened and as such left me bored and looking at my watch. The ending scene I pretty much fast forwarded. If there was supposed to be any kind of emotional response, I detected none. Is I said, sure, I am not the target audience but the movie being so successful I expected at least something other than boredom. My only emotional response I guess is sadness, because of the inevitable copycats and sequels that will try and leech of the success of Barbie, which isn't any good in the first place.Edit: In hindsight I reviewed my rating and gave a bit more, because days later stuff like the Mojo Dojo Casa House, or I'm just Ken just stuck with me more than I like to admit so there are memorable things and as I said, the opening of the movie is indeed fun. I still think they ran out of ideas and weren't sure how to end things and as such would be weary of a sequel given that there weren't enough ideas for a single movie IMO.","

Barbie," What A Film! I Was Ecstatic About Seeing Barbie And It Definitely Exceeded My Expectations By Far.
",rannynm,21-Jul-23,"What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that's how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie's world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he's one of my favorite actors. There's a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who's going through struggles of just being a woman and I'm sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company's supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you'd expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish's ""What was I made for"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it's like to grow up in today's society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today's society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

Barbie," The Ken Stuff Goes on WAY Too Long
",thalassafischer,18-Jan-24,"The weirdest thing about Barbie is that Greta Gerwig couldn't even do Barbie without making such a HUGE deference to Ken. I get that she was trying to make a statement about how women feel by using the Ken's as an ""opposite mirror"" to try to get men to understand patriarchy. I do get that. But aren't there multiple speeches about how taking care of men and fixing them isn't women's job?Good lord there was a point where Ryan Gosling's pity-party singing just gets on my nerves and I almost wanted to turn this flick off. I told myself that at some point Barbie would stop being a bad musical and turn back into a funny film with some adult commentary about gender roles in society.","

Barbie," This movie tries to be too much
",brianjohnson-20043,24-Jul-23,"I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.","

Barbie," Surprisingly good
",Jeremy_Urquhart,23-Jul-23,"I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).Overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It's bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It's very funny in parts, and though I guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""What's a fascist?"" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie's movie, but Ryan Gosling's Ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is Barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). I don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. I also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.It's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don't think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this.","

",rhuffq,30-Jul-23,"The story in Barbie isn't about a doll. It's about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.We created them, and we can change them. We can make them what ever we want them to be. We can make ourselves what ever we want to be. The tag line for the barbie doll is ""You can be anything."" That in the point of the movie.

Barbie," A real mixed bag
",Leofwine_draca,20-Aug-23,"BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.","

Barbie," Fun film whose script falls in on itself
",mark-217-307033,19-Jul-23,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.","

Barbie," A trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes
",fredrikgunerius,01-Aug-23,"The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.","

Barbie," Barbie is a beautiful love letter to womanhood.
",saramilenkovic1994,03-Aug-23,"Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.","

Barbie," Barbie land and reality
",AvionPrince16,19-Jul-23,"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.","

The most controversial aspect of the Barbie character, whether it exacerbates women's appearance anxiety, is hardly mentioned at all.

There are homages to classic films from the very start that had me rolling with laughter, and it never let up.In some ways I was reminded of Yellow Submarine seasoned with a strong dose of Legally Blonde.If there was anything that dragged it was the ending. So many excellent films barrel along with one plot twist or other surprise after another (Barbie certainly does) and then there's the question of how to tie up the loose ends and provide a believable ending, and in context too. Barbie just about manages it, if a bit hokey. But then there's the final scene. It's a cracker!","

Barbie," This Barbie is dissapointed.
",badreviewer,01-Aug-23,"Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn't expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it's ""Barbie"".But wouldn't you agree with me in that it could have been excelled better? It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I'm not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just ""ok"". Just that.Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels. Now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions; and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie. Unfortunately, Barbie does not fall short in these criterias.","

Barbie," Preacher Barbie?
",max-850,27-Aug-23,"I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end. By the time they were talking about ordinary Barbie, all I could think was ""Sanctimonious Barbie.""","

Barbie," Incredibly fun film that has important messages
",willphelan,11-Nov-23,"Margot Robbie is the best possible choice to play Barbie and Ryan Gosling is terrific as Ken. It's a very interesting story and not one I would automatically expect from a Barbie movie, but I love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles. It shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have (female in Barbie Land and male in the real world) and we see why it's important to try and understand everyone's perspective. I also love how this movie dives into men's mental health with Ken's arc. It's something that gets overlooked in society and I adore how we got to see Ken learn to come to terms with who he is without Barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself. The movie gives a great arc to Barbie as she tries to understand her purpose. She realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isn't what she wants anymore. There are so many beautiful scenes where Barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human. At first she starts off thinking that she's a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to. She becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real. It's a great story and Greta Gerwig did a brilliant job directing. The set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful. The movie is also very funny and the details and references to Barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie. The music is incredible, there are so many songs in here that are great, but Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken and Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For are my favorites. They do a great job representing the themes of the movie. If I had some complaints I think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall Barbie is a success. 8/10.","

Barbie," I had no expectations but was still underwhelmed
",jacquihives,23-Jul-23,"I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.The music is good, but I wasn't prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one point.Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show. He looked like he was having the time of his life making this movie!Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie but it wasn't that interesting to watch and I didn't understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in.","

Barbie," Barbie Fantastic!
",christinawilliams-64144,31-Jul-23,"The acting was amazing. Ryan Gosling should win an award for this. There was much laughter, tears, dancing, and conflict which all played out well. The acting resembled the characters as toys, down to every little detail. Phenomenal acting! The movie shows that Barbie and Ken, and the other characters have been completely thought out. The development was very deep and relates to the audience very well. The dialogue was great, too, as there was just enough of it, showing depth. Ties into the plot and theme thoroughly.Barbie has impacted girls for many years and the movie introduces the audience to a light hearted history of it. Barbie is supposed to be perfect and experience every day at its best. But the world of Barbie the audience sees is far from perfect, and it is separated from the real world of those who actually play with her. The plot development was amazing, as Barbie goes on a mission to discover herself and save her Barbie world. In the meantime like the slogan says, ""She's everything. He's just Ken."" Ken is also having a crisis in being number two, and questions how he fits into the Barbie world. As both toys deal with their identity crises, the themes of empowerment, patriarchy, feminism, and being yourself comes into play. Other valuable life lessons are shown as well that makes this movie memorable for women and even men. The themes are powerful and heartwarming, yet raw and honest. The sound was bubbly and popping, the graphics impressed me the most. From the costumes, to the plasticity of objects, to the action everything was visually effective. The camera angles were also notable.This movie was very upbeat and much more hilarious than I orginally anticipated. The movie resonates with what its like as they tackle the real world. The movie brings so many elements from various generations of Barbie and the audience learns about the creator and what it means to be-Barbie. As she and Ken both question their existence, the heart of the movie centers on the impact that they make towards themselves and others. With fantastic graphics, dancing and song, humor, and life lessons this movie makes it a captivating film that everyone will surely enjoy!","

Barbie," Life is plastic!
",kelboy10,06-Aug-23,"Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.This silly satire soon finds itself covering too much ground about how the world of Barbie is female dominant, alongside how the real world is male dominant. It evolves into a feminist movement film that is a little dated, then slowly back peddles and suggests everyone should be who they want to be. That all you have to do is find out who you are and what your purpose is. It almost becomes lost within its own thought pattern without really conveying anything meaningful. It feels like a load of thoughts with no conclusion or that somebody has thrown a pad of post-it notes in the air. The musical tone and lighthearted comedy that seemed set to propel this movie into box office glory, felt neglected to some extent, when real world themes were contemplated. What was working at first will slowly devour with over dramatic speeches of everything that is wrong with a male dominated world. As well as other complaints about having so much on your plate and being too god damn tired.Barbie finds herself wanting to leave Barbieland to feel real emotions rather than go through day to day life like everything is perfect. The cross-over between worlds worked to some degree, to me it was showing the girl leaving behind her dolls and becoming a woman to join the sometimes scary, but real world. (Margot Robbie) portrays Barbie very simplistic, her approach works as that seems to be what Greta Gerwig aimed to show. Greta Gerwig differentiates the worlds developing both Barbie and Ken as they learn from their experience interacting with the real world. There appeared to be references to the Matrix to me as Barbie is given a choice between staying in Barbie world or going to the real world to discover what's causing her malfunctions. Also the owner Ruth Marianna Handler gives off an Oracle vibe in the scene where she offers Barbie tea. One little girl blames Barbie claiming she set women back decades making them stereotypical girly girls without a purpose except looking pretty putting clothes on and off and doing house chores.(Ryan Gosling) gives Ken a lot of charisma and is purposely obnoxious at times creating an antagonist for Barbie. The Ken's are portrayed as weak little love puppies in Barbie world without a purpose juxtaposed with how women are received in the real world. Gosling reminds me of a wrestling villain that the crowd are wanting to hate on, he is a little over the top as he is turned against his fellow Ken's by Barbie manipulation. The poor performance of Gosling attempting to cry towards the climax added to the later half of the movie losing it way. It all becomes a little too silly leaving the audience flabbergasted at what absurdity they just witnessed.","

Barbie," Big hype and the result is a mirror of today's society
",PotassiumMan,12-Aug-23,"Margot Robbie had a vision, and she was the driving force to get the Barbie movie produced by none other than world-class director Greta Gerwig.The beginning of the movie brings us back to the first trailers for the movie, when little girls discovered a new doll, the first Barbie. She was different than any other doll because she was not a baby-doll, no, she was a woman-doll; a doll which could inspire the imagination and aspiration of children.Margot Robbie plays the main character ""stereotypical Babie"" and brings her to life in every detail and introduces us to Barbieworld with all her friends. The perfect repeated ""best day every day"" gets disrupted by unknown circumstances and ""stereotypical Barbie"" accompanied by ""her"" Ken, portrayed by Ryan Gosling go on an adventure of their lifetime to the ""real world"". The discoveries and experiences that these two make have major impacts in both worlds.This movie is worthwhile watching for the costumes and displays as much as for the social criticism of our time. The words of Gloria's (America Ferrera) speech hit the nail on its head regarding the daily struggles of women in our modern world. This movie is a depiction of reality and a dream world. It shows the possibilities as much as the shortcomings of our times with humor and fun, a little bit of sarcasm, paired with the innocence of someone new to our reality!Highly recommended for everyone who is not too shy to face real world struggle in a pink coated Barbie world.","

",adamblackshaw-14445,29-Aug-23,"BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models. Not surprisingly Mattel was one of the producers.","

Barbie," Preach Preach Preach
",MaskedMinty,21-Jul-23,"Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)
I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.","

Barbie," A wholesome delight!
",Anurag-Shetty,23-Jul-23,"Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name. Barbie(Margot Robbie) lives a very happy life in Barbie Land, along with her fellow Barbies, Ken(Ryan Gosling) & his fellow Kens. Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land & the truth of her existence.Barbie is a phenomenal film. Director Greta Gerwig has given us a movie that is a tribute to everyone who used to play with Barbie dolls during their childhood, while also making fun of all the tropes of Barbie dolls & Ken dolls. This film is hilarious, with a few emotional scenes that will make you tear up & a beautiful message at the end. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is awe-inspiring. All the songs are foot-tappingly flawless. The choreography is faultless. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Barbie. Robbie's multi-layered portrayal of the titular character, proves that she's the perfect choice to play Barbie. Ryan Gosling is spectacular as Ken. Gosling portrays a wide range of emotions, effortlessly. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the highlight of the movie. America Ferrera is fantastic as Gloria. Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Sasha. Will Ferrell is hysterical as the Mattel CEO. Michael Cera is perfect as Allan. Helen Mirren is epic as the Narrator. The supporting cast is superb. Barbie is a must watch for a burst of childhood nostalgia & fans of Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling. Wear a bright pink shirt, grab your friends, head to your nearest theatre, watch it on the big screen & have an absolute whale of a time!","

",mr_sharma,27-Jul-23,"I suspect this is a personal thing. Who you are defines what you may get from this.Me - I'm well into my mid life (had my crisis already thank you). I have daughters and both have watched this. I'm also pretty laid back to life. I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.Now to the movie.For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9/10 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7/10 good.A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been. But as has been shown by Lego movie, Detective Pickachu and few others....you can take something predominantly aimed at children and make it into something that both adults and children can engage with.The core message is great.I must say, I have heard a lot about Ryan Gosling being funny. He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.But it is funny and enjoyable enough.Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will. It will though give pause for thought to all those who do go view it.A good, fun movie worth paying for the entertainment.","

Barbie," Plastic in the worst way possible
",Criticalstaff,30-Sep-23,"It took me quite some time to decipher this movie. I felt like I was missing something, that there was more to it than first apparent. The acting, the dialogue, the sets, the costume: technically it is polished and purposeful; yet I was utterly unable to engage with it. And finally it hit me: that is because it is actually a commercial.Moreover it is nothing else than a commercial. It doesn't deliver anything more than promote a product. Take the product away and there is nothing. Take away Barbie the brand, and the film is devoid of any substance. It's empty. Unlike the Lego movie for instance, similarly an unapologetic ad for children's toys, that managed to be a decent adventure film that celebrated the creativity that toys enable.Barbie functions as a film but only on the most superficial ways.It has a story, characters and lines of dialogue. And while some of the dialogue is clever and funny, and some of the characterization opens the door to some interesting character study, overall it is weighted down by the absolute obtuseness of the plot. The worst flaw is that it doesnt give anything of substance to do to Barbie, the protagonist. Almost every other character is moving the plot forward by either taking action or moving the story forward by emotional growth. Barbie herself is just a side character that goes from A to B and back to A. Physically, as well as emotionally. Ken has a far more interesting journey and arc. Gloria has a more important role in the story. Arguably even Sasha and Allen work better as characters with whom you relate and empathise.The worst thing is that the movie is not even a commercial for the dolls. Rather it is a commercial for the idea of the doll. I don't know if we can get more post-modern than that. Barbie is not an actual doll in the movie, but she is literally the thing you think of when you describe someone as a ""Barbie"" Yet the film is very much so a commercial for Mattel's Barbie and the intellectual property it represents. I think it is crass and pedestrian. The movie is purely a corporate maneuver to pivot from one business to another, from manufacturing toys to manufacturing content.That is why this film throws so much at the wall to see what sticks; that is why when Barbie leaves fake plastic Barbie-land, she escapes to fake plastic Los Angeles and nobody picks up on the irony. That's why they have garbage collector Barbies in a world where there is no garbage. That's why they have women Barbie doctors that aren't actual doctors and when later Ken meets a real doctor in the real world, you're waiting for a call-back that never happens.This movie is the absolute opposite of art. To call it a film is an insult to everything we hold sacred.","

Barbie," Barbie existentialism.
",jp_91,24-Jul-23,"Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.","

",SoumikBanerjee1996,10-Nov-23,"When the execution banks on shrewd humour and clever writing, the movie thrives as a vivid spectacle, as a lighthearted entertainer, but whenever it delves deeper than the surface and enthusiastically seeks for the hidden under-layers, the psyches of Barbie and Ken, their understanding of the world and their impaired perspectives, the output just becomes so much fuller, the film comes to be something else altogether.However, the emotionally motivated instants seldom come out in the open, as the narrative, for the most part, leans on the fun, humorous side, and frankly speaking, it was bound to be like that.After all, it's a feature that is made mainly by keeping younger audiences in mind. It's just that Greta is a great storyteller, and I think highly of her directorial skills; thus, I expected to see more of 'her'!","

Barbie," A Tale of Two Halves
",svynronin,06-Jan-24,"The movie starts in one direction and then changes course half way through to a rushed and unsatisfying end. The second hour of the movie is a stark contrast to the first hour. There were funny moments mixed with thoughtful gender roles, views on our patriarchal society, self-worth, etc. That took a complicated subject and made it interesting in the first half. The problem is, the movie then begins to take itself too seriously and the second half loses the clever comedy and pushes stereotypes of male and female gender roles in our society to become a rushed mess of a story that becomes preachy. There are a lot of issues in today's society with regards to gender roles, feminism, our patriarchal society, etc. The problem is the movie seems to take on some of these issues with comedy, then takes a more serious tone, and rushes through the second half so that characters brought forward in the first half have no real resolution. Sure Barbie finds her purpose at the movie's end, but it becomes a mess to get there. The rich comedy common in the first half turns to slapstick and serious drama. Are there two more opposites than slapstick and drama? The first half had me rethinking my views on how women are treated with it's lighthearted comedy, while the second half had me bothered by pushing male stereotypes into a slapstick war and a rush to finish while also being preached to about male and female gender roles. The movie seems to lose it's purpose and then rushes for a resolution. The mom and daughter story would have been better explored with a light hearted comedy that touches on gender roles and a woman's self-worth, and making it for the whole family but especially focused on an audience of young girls and women who are trying to figure out who they are. It really should have explored the mother and daughter characters and how they each struggle with being a woman in society and used Barbie as a tool of them helping to better understand each other. The movie glosses over this and despite their differences their complicated relationship is easily fixed as the focus turns back to Barbie and the focus on her. The movie brings up good ideas and a good story to once again have Hollywood ruin it. It loses focus as too many ideas, issues, characters, and plots, are brought up, to have it rushed to a finish with only some resolved. All a common problem with too many Hollywood movies these days. What is the purpose of your story? Who is it written for? Why are you writing it? Focus on that, and don't let others over complicate it. It's sad that a movie that brings up important issues especially with women's self-worth with both older and younger women is ruined by too much of everything else this movie takes on.","

Barbie," Its just Barbie and Ken
",olcare,11-Aug-23,"There's so much to say about the movie, so many points to touch on that I don't know how to express it correctly.Let me start by discussing a few parts that I really liked. First of all, Ryan Gosling's performance was amazing; it overshadowed everything in the film. A masterful and remarkable performance. While not Margot Robbie's best performance, she did quite well too. I didn't find the other actors or actresses quite as impressive.Another aspect I found impressive was the costumes; in my opinion, the film definitely deserved an Oscar for them. They were the best costumes I've seen in a long time. Similarly, the color coordination was superb.I also enjoyed the production; most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint. The comedy in the film was of good quality, and there were scenes that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watching.Now, moving on to the things I didn't like, and the area I'd like to emphasize the most - the screenplay. After watching a strong first half, I became very invested in the movie, but the ending suffocated me. Trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless. The film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half; there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner. I understood the message, but I ended up leaving the theater feeling frustrated.In addition, there's a part I absolutely disliked: Barbie's convincing Kens with their beauty and then reclaiming Barbie Land. It felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie. It definitely could have been written more cleverly. Moreover, the metaphorical scene of Classic Barbie talking to the creator (metaphorically) and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed. It was emotional, yes, but personally, it felt heavy.In short, summing up the technical aspects and acting, the film scored a 6.5 to 7 from me. However, the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed. Women are our treasures; we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other. Let's love one another, let's love our women - they are our mothers. They are all invaluable, and so are we. Hopefully, one day everyone will be equal, just like Barbie's aim, and you can achieve your goals just like Ken does.Note: Regardless of everything, people should stop comparing Barbie and Oppenheimer ; Barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign, and it's necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts.","

Barbie," More of a marketing flick
",shadowtramp,22-Jul-23,"The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.The photography is good though. So the average is 5/10
It is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda.","

Barbie," Great philosophical film to think about and laugh about.
",anonim-73883,03-Aug-23,"This is.... Was.... Admirably!I'm absolutely delighted!I don't want to write, it's a huge review of Barbie, therefore:
""Barbie"" is a great philosophical film to think about and laugh about.I think that this tape will appeal to everyone, from collectors of Barbie dolls and those who rummage around in the Barbie universe (like me, for example) and ending with those people who do not know anything about it at all.Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie; Ryan Gosling is silly, but chic and perfect Ken. Their tandem is gorgeous, every time they were, together; I was very pleased to see them.Also, I was very pleased to see John Cena, Dua Lipa and Kate McKinnon. They're gorgeous.The jokes in Barbie are orious, and in the finale I roared.The plot is excellent, interesting, easy and, as I wrote above, philosophical.I haven't watched Oppenheimer yet, but I already think that Barbie is a more serious film against it!The soundtrack of ""Barbie"" is wonderful; I listen to it every day now.In general, I did not notice the disadvantages of Barbie, but noticed some advantages.As a result, ""Barbie"" is an ideal, wonderful film to laugh and be sad and think.I put the tape 10 out of 10 and if you have it in cinemas, then run and watch it!IT'S WORTH WATCHING ON THE BIG SCREEN!!REVISION IN CINEMA!!Well, let me remind you for those who have forgotten or for those who have not read my last review of «Barbie» that in July of this year I watched it in a soapy but normal screen.After watching it, I was delighted and decided that I had to go to the cinema and watch this film again.And finally, today (September 9), the unofficial show of «Barbie» officially began, and just today I went to it!Even the price of 500 rubles did not stop me, because when I watched the screen, I understood that it is better to see such a movie on the big screen!In short, my opinion has not changed!«Barbie» - is still a great philosophical film to think about and laugh at.I think this is the end of it, because I don't want to write the same thing as in July!I will add that I am still delighted with this film and I again give it 10 out of 10 and again I want to recommend it for viewing, especially in the cinema!Because, if you compare viewing in the cinema and in the screens, then these are completely different things and in the cinema I got even more emotions and delight from this film!P. S: Well, now I'm waiting for «Oppenheimer», but I don't know when I'm going to see it, haha.","

Barbie," Colourful, but confusing
",Lincsobserver,10-Sep-23,"Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.","

Barbie," ""Barbie"" is fun and visually beautiful, but unfortunately Barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy
",fernandoschiavi,22-Jul-23,"Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?"" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Truman Show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. ""Barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""Barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast ""Real Time"" in which he said: ""Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""Stereotyped"" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are ""d*mb"". The Barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).""Barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, Barbie doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. ""Who is Barbie?""","

Barbie," Everyone watch this
",kimberlyely-27550,25-Jul-23,"BarbieDid you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.","

Barbie," I'll beach you off so hard
",FeastMode,20-Jul-23,"I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.To my surprise, I didn't feel that at all. This movie is hilarious. It's the kind of stupid-funny I love, the kind usually reserved for ""dude movies."" Something you're more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie. I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny.Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun, Margot Robbie still gives a great performance, as usual. She continues to prove she's a star. And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions.I found Barbie highly entertaining. I think most will enjoy it, except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men. That's not me. The parts that made me laugh the most are the jokes about the guys.(1 viewing, early fan screening UltraScreen 7/19/2023)","

",sjw1029,05-Aug-23,Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office. There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.Side note: Greta Gerwig must be a fan of Sex Education - three actors end up here.,"

Barbie," Great if not ham-fisted message but a sloppy movie.
",dmmart-28624,23-Jul-23,"I was pretty excited to see this film and hope I'm not going to get put on a list for saying I didn't enjoy it that much. The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.","

Barbie," Mind blowing
",tforbes-2,01-Aug-23,"Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way! I was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since I have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.And what we have is a combination of The Twilight Zone and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.It really focuses in on one Barbie (Margot Robbie) who finds herself out of her element, and her struggle to comes to terms with herself. Though the film has some weirdness to it, it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shines.And its messages pack a wallop!!!The casting is top notch, starting with Ms. Robbie in the title role. Ryan Gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well, with a wide range. But one actress truly deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and that is America Ferrara. The other performers are likewise great!I'm also struck by how Mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isn't always flattering. And toward the end, we have the Barbie doll's creator, Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman) tell Ms. Robbie's character some facts about herself that are less than flattering. That scene alone is incredibly powerful.And of course, the visuals are something to behold!On the whole, a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality! Highly recommended!","

Barbie," Not written well enough
",jfgibson73,25-Sep-23,"I thought the storyline of this movie was not well structured. The first act was mostly fun with some genuine humor. We see Barbie living in a world that looks like the toys brought to life. When she decides to go to the ""real world,"" it disrupts life for the residents of toyland. We also learn that many girls resent Barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females. Then, the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the Barbie world and treating the women poorly. So now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself. It gets very muddled and isn't much fun at this point. I thought they should have kept it simple, because they seemed to be on the right track early on.","

",madanmarwah,07-Aug-23,"Director Greta Gerwig takes us on a fun ride in the life of stereotypical Barbie ( Margot Robbie) as she navigates through various aspects of her life. She is joined by Ken ( Ryan Gosling) in this fantasy of pink decor, colourful costumes and the kitsch sets in a dream like atmosphere . The movie has exquisite cinematography ,melodious songs and attractive dances. There is an innocent quirkiness in the characters and the intermittent light humour keeps one amused. There is fun and fantasy all the way in all colourful scenes. The rainbows in the background add to the beauty. The cinematography has carefully framed fabulous visuals which will appeal to all audiences. The highlight of course is the superb acting of Margot Robbie who excells in exuding the innocent charm of the much loved character. She is definitely a refined artist who gets under the skin of the character. Ryan Gosling also does well as Ken showing his versatility. His one liners are said with his typical charm which will please his fans. The special effects help to create the dream like ambience and are pleasing to watch.

It's funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive ""person's"" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it. I think any guy tagging along to see this will enjoy it unless he's a misogynist and/or very insecure in his masculinity.","

Barbie," Barbie is a masterpiece and I'm not joking
",russellquisenberry,26-Jul-23,"I'm not a Barbie fan. The only time I loved Barbie was when she was in the Toy Story movies. But that changed after I saw the Barbie movie. This movie is not only Greta Gerwig's best film but also the year's greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there's Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.The story starts with Barbie doing her usual routine in Barbieland, a land filled with multiple Barbies, each with a different occupation. The Ken's also visit playing the roles a woman would play. Barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death, crying and flat feet. She learns from Weird Barbie that the Real World will have the answers to her questions. Barbie than travels with Ken to the real world and find out many things : Barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named Gloria (America Ferrera in her best movie performance), Mattel wants to put Barbie back in the box and Ken learns about America's patriarchy and men rule the world. All of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to be.The production design of Barbieland and costumes of all the Barbies and Kens are Oscar-worthy. The soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs: Ryan Gosling's 80s ballad called I'm Just Ken and Billie Ellish's emotional song at the end of the movie, ""What was I made for?"".The direction of Greta Gerwig is finally put to great use in Barbie as she's goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy, great-comedy drama and emotional drama.Gosling gives his best and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination as his role of Ken is up there with the comedy greats of Meliss Mccarthy in Bridesmaids and Robert Downey Jr. In Tropic Thunder.The real scene stealer is Margot Robbie. Robbie has been in multiple box office failures but Barbie changed that. She's been nominated twice for the Oscar for her incredible performances in I, Tonya and Bombshell. My favorite actress is about to be nominated for Best Actress and Best Picture for Barbie!!!! Margot Robbie is astonishing and a tour de force in Barbie, which is the best performance of her whole career!!! Go Margot Robbie!!!!!This movie is definitely worth watching!!!!!! I want to watch it again!!!!!!","

Barbie," Barbie Land
",AvionPrince16,19-Jul-23,"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.","

Barbie," Life in plastic, it's fantastic!
",mr_bickle_the_pickle,25-Jul-23,"It's an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.The soundtrack also works really within the film. I don't know how many of them I would listen to separately. I also wouldnt be suprised if either ""Im just Ken"" or ""What was I made for?"" or both was nominated for an oscar. Speaking of oscars, I think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design, costumes, hair and makeup - because visually this movie is such a treat.Now I dont think all aspects worked for me. I don't think the Mattel/CEO subplot was needed. There could have been another way for her to go back to Barbieland organically. I felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this ""chase scene"" didnt add much. Also, Gloria's (America Ferrera) monologue. Now, dont get me wrong I think there is a lot truth to it. But I just found it somewhat one-note. It didn't exactly blow me away as it has for others. And lastly, I undertstand the importance of having Ruth Handler featured in the movie....just a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in Mattel headquarters.Overall, I would definitely recommend the film. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll have fun. This isn't just a movie, it is the moment.","

Barbie," Disappointed
",johnschubert-93854,23-Dec-23,"I didn't see Barbie in the theater (but I don't see many in the theater anymore) but I had seen glowing reviews as well as friends who had seen the film and recommended. By the time I was able to view the film I had high expectations. There were certainly extremely funny moments, but for me few and far between. Gosling was singled out by many as the best in the film and I agreed there were enough outlandish moments with his character that earned him that. But, I thought that Michael Cera's character Allan was far funnier, even though his role was more of an extended cameo. I can't deny that Margot Robbie was an exceptional Barbie but overall I was disappointed with the film. Gerwig went a bit too far with her support of women's rights (which I do support). It may have been the build up prior to seeing the movie that actually resulted in it not reaching my expectations. I've had that same issue with other films, however.","

Barbie," I'm actually ashamed to have watched this rubbish!
",mjw2305,12-Feb-24,"When it was announced that Barbie was to be made as a live action movie I cringed and pretty much forget about it. Then the hype erupted, and you couldn't get away from the frenzy surrounding this movie. I had to see the trailer; my intrigue got the better of me.Wow! It actually looked good! Parody, satire, an interesting premise.Now, I wasn't prepared to just take the plunge, I still had my doubts and didn't want to be paying Cinema or home premier prices. So, I waited, but remained strangely eager to enjoy this guilty pleasure and hopefully have a great laugh in the process. After all, the reviews and buzz around Barbie never seemed to die down too much.£1.99 on Prime was the clincher. I am a middle-aged man, and I persuaded my wife and teenage son to watch it with me. The Trailer sold it to them easily.Instant smiles when kids began smashing their dolls, mimicking the apes in 2001: A Space Odyssey.The next 15 minutes was sickly but set the scene and bridged to the premise teased so much in the trailers.The next hour was ok, but never really reached my expectations. It had some humorous moments, little else.The final 30 minutes was just awful! Terrible songs and relentless bashing over the head with their big message. It was insulting how the movie makers forced this down the viewers throats as if we were all completely dumb and wouldn't understand it if it wasn't repeated over and over again!It wasn't the message that ruined the movie, the message is valid and strong, I couldn't agree with it more! Sadly, the movie is largely boring and dull. This formula framed in a sickly Barbie world as it is, just doesn't convey the message well at all.Great ad campaign, and obviously the movie is appealing to some, just not to me or my family.A generous 3/10
My wife gave it 0/10My advice if you feel the urge to watch, as I did. Give it 30 minutes. If you aren't seeing what you came for by then, it isn't for you.","

Barbie," Laugh, Reflect, Repeat: Exploring the Wonders of 'Barbie'
",sanadalsalt,27-Jul-23,"Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with ""Barbie"" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, ""Barbie"" is a cinematic experience like no other.From start to finish, ""Barbie"" captivates audiences with its seamless blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. Gerwig's direction is nothing short of brilliant as she brings the world of Barbie to life with a perfect balance of humor and depth. The humor, in particular, is off the charts hilarious, with giant laugh-out-loud moments that had me clutching my sides. It's remarkable how the humor appeals to viewers of all ages, making it one of the funniest movies of the year.But what truly sets ""Barbie"" apart is its profound and thought-provoking narrative. The film revolves around Barbie's existential crisis and her quest to find meaning in her existence. This exploration of Barbie's identity as a feminist symbol is incredibly compelling and challenges societal norms and expectations surrounding femininity and girlhood. Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals? This deep, existential question lingers long after the credits roll, prompting introspection and discussion.Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings a charisma and depth to the character that is truly captivating. Watching her journey of self-discovery unfold on screen is an absolute joy. And let's not forget Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken, which complements Robbie's Barbie perfectly. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts and adds another layer of excitement to the film.I should mention that ""Barbie"" has received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and it's easy to see why. It strikes a perfect balance between appealing to longtime fans and captivating new audiences. The movie's mass appeal transcends age, gender, and previous Barbie doll opinions, making it a delightful and engaging experience for viewers of all backgrounds.Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Barbie"" remains family-friendly and suitable for teenagers and older kids. The clever marketing of the film ensures that it appeals to a wide range of audiences, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an absolute triumph in every aspect of filmmaking. With its stellar cast, innovative approach, brilliant humor, and profound exploration of societal themes, it more than deserves a perfect 10/10 rating. This cinematic gem is a must-watch for anyone seeking an enchanting and thought-provoking experience that transcends the boundaries of age and nostalgia. Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of ""Barbie."" Trust me, you won't be disappointed!","

Barbie," Expected more from Greta Gerwig
",JPARM-IMDb,26-Jul-23,"Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.The main problem is that the overall message isn't clear. This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to explore multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars.","

Barbie," I Was Bored Senseless!
",martimusross,09-Oct-23,"BarbieWhat a confusing mess, firstly to be a comedy it must pass the minimum bar of 6 out loud laughs per movie, I laughed twice. The humour employed was largely slapstick and situational irony, it had roughly the same feel as the surreality of a Wes Anderson movie, but without his touch.The whole thing lacked a strong story and any sort of narrative impetus. It really was very tedious, with much the same scene content played over and over again.The styling was good as was some of the dance routines and stylised doll movements from the cast, but even this got tiresome.The cast tried their best with the material, but to my mind Margot Robbie has done two duff movies in a row, this and Babylon. I am being to think she lacks good judgement and any acting heft.In terms of other reviewers on here, they were watching a different movie and judging the vague thematic material as a plus because it looked at the power dynamic between men and women, forgetting the exploration undertaken in this movie was a historical perspective from the 1960's, when Barbie was invented and really had little application in 2023.In summation it was style over substance, it lacked humour and story and indeed anything memorable. At best this is a 3 outta 10 for the dance sequences.","

Barbie," Perceptive Take on the Barbie Mythos
",EUyeshima,15-Aug-23,"There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.","

Barbie," Fun, but too on the nose at times
",DanLawson146,03-Aug-23,"POSITIVES:1) Ryan Gosling completely steals the film for me. He's hilarious, but also completely sells the emotional moments too. A great performance 2) The film had several moments that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the humour is very clever, as can be expected from these two great writers. I should also say that I think the emotional moments were written very well too, particularly Barbie and Ken's 'breakup' at the end, which I thought was the best scene in the film 3) The production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective OscarsNEGATIVES:1) There are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me. Examples include the chase scene in the Mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2) The message, whilst respectable in a way, was just far too on the nose for me at times. When it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting, but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3) The film felt quite dated for me. If this had came out in the 90s or 2000s I feel like it would've been much more impactful and relevant, whereas nowadays not many kids play with Barbie dolls and the male-dominated society is nowhere near as prevalent.","

Ryan Gosling Nails it. He was Absolutely Hilarious at Times (Especially in the 3RD Act)7. Much of the Comedy Landed for me (Comedy is Subjective, so also, Some Didn't) and from what I Heard, it Landed for a Lot of the Audience I was with. (Beached off Wasn't Funny, but after That, The Laughs Started Coming in). (4th Wall Ugly Joke, Margot Is the Wrong Example for this, was the Biggest Laugh in the theatre 😆)8. So to Summarise, I Really Liked the Beach Battle, The Dance Scenes, the Plotline, The Comedy, the Tone, The Aesthetics and the Atmosphere in that Theatre whilst Watching this Thing.From what I watched, it was Well Put Together, Well Excecuted and everything Came Together So Well.

Barbie," A perfect dollhouse
",eagandersongil,12-Aug-23,"""Barbie"": Greta Gerwig's new film manages to be extremely creative and original while, at the same time, a bit generic. The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there's a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It's not; it's just more entertaining. The only ""weak"" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives. It's one of the weaker aspects of a good, fun, exciting, and creative film, which falls short of being even better due to stumbling over its details.","

Barbie," Kenchanting Kentertainment
",southdavid,16-Aug-23,"Based purely on having come out of one film and planning to see whatever fit in next, I went to see ""Barbie"" this weekend. There was much I enjoyed about it, but I'd have loved to have know less about it heading in.Having previously lived a joyous and perfect life in Barbieworld, stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) starts to have intrusive thoughts about her own mortality, she discovers cellulite on her legs and her feet go flat. Having visited weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) who explains that to cure these issues, she must travel to the real world and bond with her owner. Ken (Ryan Gosling) only experiences his worth when he's seen by Barbie and, whilst not invited, accompanies her on her adventure. Whilst Barbie learns that her assumptions about Barbie's positive effect on the real world aren't at all accurate, Ken discovers a concept that can revolutionise his life, the patriarchy.I am far from the first person to comment that ""Barbie"" is much cleverer, grown up and subversive than it might have been expected to have been, in the hands of other film makers. Gerwig though, constructed a tale that manages to be a love letter to Mattel's iconic character, an honest appraisal of the same characters legacy, a treatise of the position of women in the world, a considered look at male relationships and funny comedy at the same time. It set design and cinematography are great, as are the performances from a surprisingly Anglo-centric cast.Why haven't I scored it even higher then? Mostly it's my fault, the film has been so dissected and meme-field on Twitter that, even though I wasn't actively looking for it, I knew many of the beats and surprises before I saw the film. I thought that perhaps the films songs could have been a touch better, I know people like them, but I can't really remember any of them just a couple of days later.I'm annoyed, but not surprised that the lesson Hollywood seems to have immediately taken from this is not, lets let interesting and varied filmmakers have carte blanche to turn properties into interesting films, but instead it's ""movies about toys!"". I'm bracing for the wall of garbage to come, but I hope we don't forget that, as with ""The Lego Movie"" you can have a real success with a property if you believe in the creative teams.","

Barbie," Barbie - Unspeakably Bad
",jonathanruano,21-Jul-23,"I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the ""real world."" Where did we see that storyline before? Let's see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.But if that's not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.Even the people who like it can't point to anything original in it.

Barbie," Great Casting: But is it Satire or Social Commentary?
",ThereelscoopwithKK,15-Aug-23,"The casting for the roles is pretty well spot on. Margot Robbie is an absolute superstar and nobody would fit the role of Barbie better. I liked the little joke when Barbie says ""I'm not pretty anymore. I'm not 'stereotypical Barbie' pretty and the narrator replies "" Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point."" Even when they try to make Margot Robbie less pretty they can't really achieve it. Robbie shines with charisma every time she is on a screen and this movie is no exception. Not only is she very attractive but her acting is superb as well.They also found perfect roles for Ryan Gosling and Will Ferrell. The roles fit their skill sets perfectly and made the best of what is overall a pretty unusual and scattered movie. The costumes in the film were also fantastic and probably helped tap into some nostalgia with people who played with Barbie's before.The movies biggest issue in my mind was that it couldn't ever really decide what it was. This led to an inability to achieve any momentum as you aren't sure whether it's going to hit you with silly jokes that were quite funny at times or whether you were supposed to scramble through the social messaging it was also clearly trying to send. The problem is especially clear when the two blurred together. I wasn't sure whether some topics were serious social messages they are trying to advance or to simply be viewed as a joke.The ending made it all even more confusing. I don't mind endings being preachy but it was unclear what the audience is supposed to take away from what went down.Overall I would have preferred if the entire movie was one big comedy , but I suppose the filmmakers knew best since they're the ones raking in the cash right now. Kudos to them. Great Casting but is it Satire or Social Commentary?","

",D4V1D2411,06-Aug-23,": I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.","

Barbie," Barbie
",jboothmillard,01-Aug-23,"The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn't ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. ""Stereotypical"" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha's comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha's mother Gloria (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie's self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken's friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland's previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls ""wanted to be""; she named ""Barbie"" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie's story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name ""Barbara Handler"", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable ""stereotypical"" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (""Pink"" by Lizzo, ""Dance the Night"" by Dua Lipa) (the original ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!","

Barbie," Barbie is a totally meta movie
",grigoraaakis-889-295918,24-Nov-23,"It is a wonder that a live action ""Barbie"" movie came to be, and it's a wonder how Mattel has let it happen. This is a totally meta movie, so self-conscious. It knows what it stands for, what it wants to say and what it represents. It's a work done by a woman, it's obvious in every dialogue and every frame. Mattel is very supportive of what it says, it's actually really forward of them that they enabled this to happen. Greta took a chance and rather than making just another studio movie, she crafted a masterpiece. ""Barbie"" is all about self-identity and discovery and it's a journey to accepting once self and loving it. ""Barbie"" is the Barbie doll we know and still this movie showcases the effect of her on our lives now. It examines all the good and the bad ""Barbie"" has given to the world. It's a movie by a female director with a clear vision and a clear goal, it's made with absolute love and respect for the source material and with an eye for every minor detail. ""Barbie"" is a movie made by someone who knows the Barbie doll. ""Barbie"" is a funny movie, it really is very funny and so much fun. Margot Robbie is ""Barbie"", you simply believe it. She's given us her absolute best and it shows in every frame. Ryan Gosling must have had an absolute blast with Ken. He simply got the assignment. Their dynamic is a way to examine the gender dynamics of our world. What a movie!","

",moriumemoltre,20-Jul-23,"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.","

",gianthaole,23-Jul-23,"My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for? If you are thinking of watching something this month, choose Sound of Freedom or Mission Impossible.","

Barbie," A lot of fun and surprisingly funny
",hjalsayegh,10-Aug-23,"The movie is surprisingly well written. Yes it is a fluff piece, it's called Barbie after all, but for what it was a lot of thought went into all the little details.Fun both in barbieland and the real world, the jokes were surprising as quite a few of them were at Mattel's expense.It tackles real world issues but in a fun and light hearted way. It is however 100% targeted at women, I'd say middle aged since that was the majority of the theater and the topics not really suitable for young girls.I do wonder if it was a bit harsh on men as it did lean way too much into He vs She debate in the second half.Margot Robbie was amazing as Barbie but Ryan Gosling very much stole the show. He owned every second of his screen time.","

Barbie," Lots of plastic but not fantastic
",jamesrupert2014,07-Jan-24,"Plagued by strange un-Barbie-like thoughts, Barbie (Margot Robbie) leaves 'Barbielend' for the 'Realworld' (along with tag-along Ken (Ryan Gosling)) where she (as a doll) has been rejected by a child, only to discover that the male-dominated Realworld is not to her tastes. The film has some fun moments (especially in the first third) and fabulous imagery but the social-messaging was a bit heavy-handed and I quickly lost interest in the story, especially during the interminable and unmemorable song-and dance numbers. Anyone interested in a parody of 'Mattel's Barbie' would be better served watching 'Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy' (Simpsons s.5, ep.14), which is much more clever, funnier, and a lot shorter. Evidence that 'Barbie' has not shamed me out of my gynophilic mindset: I rated the movie an extra star simply because Margot Robbie is soooo pretty.","

I hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. We understand, the patriarchy is bad. But I didn't go to this movie to be preached to.I was hoping it would be a bit more camp. I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. This was far from that.The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed. Margot Robbie looked fabulous at all times.","

Barbie," We're All Dolls
",klastaitas,28-Jul-23,"Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?And more importantly where would we find ourselves?In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), Greta Gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.Barbie is perfect. Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.","

Barbie," A lot like The Lego Movie - except for the 2nd half
",Vic_max,29-Jul-23,"As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls, I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.It's amazing to think that, a few years back, Amy Schumer was going to star in the title role. Though after seeing Margot Robbie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.Anyway ... like most moviegoers - I enjoyed this movie. It's a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. The ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the ""real world"".But unlike The Lego Movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn't able to keep the momentum going. While there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.The message was good: you don't have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. However, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.But - don';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! There's a lot to like and it's kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie-love that spans generations. Enjoy this experience with a big audience and you'll be glad you did.","

Barbie," A triumph
",PedroPires90,20-Jul-23,"I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.","

Barbie," Cute but shallow
",steveinadelaide,24-Jul-23,"So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie's world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.Barbie isn't a masterpiece. It's not a disaster, either. It's an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.Cute but shallow.","

Barbie," Barbie, Swing and a Miss
",michelle-kissler,21-Jul-23,"This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.","

",TaylorYee94,27-Sep-23,"As a woman, I could relate to every message and every line said in the movie. That may be the problem: verbally explaining through Baribe and Gloria's line most of the time rather than portraying what the problem is. It's like my mom giving me a lot of wonderful advice, but what changes me the most is what I see with my own eyes. To get the message crossed, 'Barbie' loses the tension of the story as time passes.'Barbie' is upbeat, bright, and cheerful; the comedy aspect really works for adults as well. The first half is really great and engrossing, but from the part where Barbie & Gloria and Mattel people go back to Barbieland, it loses power and attractions. 'I'm Just Ken' sequence is boring, and how Barbies solve the problem is super easy and simple because it's in Barbieland. I feel even defeated how gender inequality is treated this lightly and carefreelySoundtrack is the best quality. Billie Eilish's song at the end almost saves the film. Four-minute song captures more essence and core of 'Barbie' than the film itself.","

",bbosma-24403,27-Nov-23,"I didn't expect a lot, but got even less. I just found it irritating from start to finish - well, start to halfway, because I just couldn't take any more. I had thought that maybe it would be clever like Enchanted (the original, not the appalling sequel) with a short sequence in Barbie World (like Enchanted's cartoon cliche intro) and then quickly turn into a humorous and entertaining fish out of water story of Barbie adapting to the real world. Instead the opening Barbie World sequence goes way too long, and then the 'real' world she goes to isn't just short, it's more plastic and silly than Barbie World. When she returned to Barbie World, I couldn't take anymore and switched off. My advice? If you're not hooked by the first 15 minutes, do the same. It only gets worse.","

Barbie," Take your mom, sister, daughter, aunt, everyone to see this movie!
",roro_sa,30-Jul-23,"This movie was so unexpected.Completely opposite to what I thought it would be.The best movie I've seen in a long time.There were moments it had me laughing and moments in tears. It gently pushed me into self reflection and introspection which I never realised I needed to do for the longest of time.The movie dealt with so many issues, such as societal expectancies, emotional depence, perfectionism, stress, anxiety.. It brought forward self awareness, emotional intelligence, and so many insights into ones self.This movie is a must see for all women and men who are open to growth and developing their mindsets.As a millenial this movie resonated on another level, it reminded me of the self I was at a younger age, before falling into societal norms.Will definitely watch it again and again.","

Barbie," Not a film that will hold up (and not because of its politics)
",atleverton,07-Jan-24,"This movie falls apart with any sort of critical evaluation. There are good and funny moments of the film, but I don't think the film is going to hold up in the coming years. It claims to be an examination of feminism through the eyes of this doll. The dolls think that they have solved the problems of the real world by their existence, a trip to the real world makes it clear that this is not the case. The Kens, who are an underclass in the fantasy world, stage a rebellion and take it over. The rebellion is put down and everything returns to the status quo. And the status quo is not gender equality, it's a ruling class and a subservient class. Stripping the ideology away from the film, the story of how this universe works doesn't make any sense. The dolls are the way they are because of the way that children are playing with them. So if there is sort of a matriarchal Utopia, it's because little girls and little boys who are playing with the dolls have created it. So the ending of the film doesn't make any sense because the Barbies say that they don't want to return to the status quo and the Kens are learning about the real me. But they're not real. They're dolls, and their realities are determined for them. That's not the only weird part about the movie, there's the scene where the creator of the Barbie holds hands with Barbie and shows her all the feelings of a woman so that she can decide if she wants to be real or not. But in that montage, are no scenes of pain and suffering. So this Barbie becomes a real person and is set up for a life of horrible suffering because she does not understand the reality of pain. She hasn't even had a stomach ache before, or even digested food before, and now she's going to be a real woman? I don't mind films having ideologies, but I think the way filmmaking is going is not a direction in which I can follow. Apart from superhero movies, which people finally seem to be tired of, modern movie making is more about the feeling of a story, than the story. And I think there are a lot of problems with traditional storytelling and films, like the fact there are never unhappy endings in Hollywood blockbusters. But the structure of storytelling is one which gives satisfaction to the viewer because they can feel the process of the story coming together, and if there's no actual story where is the satisfaction for the viewer?","

Barbie," Barbie is the film we need right now
",parksiet,26-Jul-23,"I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.This movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It's pretty much the funnest movie ever!As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig's breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I'm super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She's easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I've become a huge fan of Gerwig's work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!Greta Gerwig's work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. What could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I'm amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You'll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I'm looking at you.)I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I'm a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It's a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can't believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It's one of the most profound pieces of writing I've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. It's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:""Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.Or, maybe there's another way. Maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.","

Barbie," A Stellar First Two Acts Followed by a Relatively Disappointing Third
",nysmbs,26-Jul-23,"Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself.","

Barbie," Wonderful
",cereyese,14-Aug-23,"I went into the theater with no expectations, somebody had told me the movie was good and I was curious, but I didn't really know what I was getting into.This is an uncommon movie. The idea being ""we have been fooled. We were told feminism had succeeded and now we find out they had been playing with us"". To me, the use of the Barbie world and the Barbie concept is fantastic, as she's supposedly been for generations of girls, the icon, the perfect woman with the perfect life achieving all she wanted. But at the same time she has been accused of embodying all that is wrong: unrealistic expectations regarding body image etc etc. Steteotypical Barbie realizing that she's been living in a bubble and the real world is not what she has been told is simply a flawless way of transmitting the message. We are all Barbie at some point.The actors performances are simply perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could not have done a better job. The stenography, the colors, the clothes, everything is just a delight.This is by far the best movie I've seen this year. I know some people find it shallow, not for children, unfunny. To them I'd say perhaps they are not evaluating the movie from the correct perspective.Intelligent, deep and aesthetically wonderful. 10/10 from me.","

They wanted to make a political movie about what women could be if we took down the patriarchy and the men can just be who they want to be with feelings and all.The execution is colorful and you feel the sarcasm in every choice the movie maker made.I would have given it a lower score but I gotta admire the research and execution.It seems I must have missed a lot of jokes because some people were laughing when I was not.What's up with having so many cast members of Sex Education?Also?!

Barbie," Why Didn't I Love This Movie?
",levybob,01-Aug-23,"Why didn't I love 'Barbie'? I mean it's a brilliantly shot film. It's got a great Ryan Gosling, a very good Margot Robbie. Its heart is in the right place; its message is a good, politically correct, one. Its pacing is fine. Its not too long. So then, what was wrong?And the answer is (I guess) ... the story. The plot. While it's far from terrible it was also far from great. And - dare I say this? - it was at times confusing. Confusing in that I did not always understand the characters' motives. Why were these dolls thinking what they were thinking, or doing what they were doing? And yes I know we're talking about fantasy here, so we can't be, or shouldn't be, ascribing real human wants and desirers to these ... dolls. But the film's message is directed to humans, as played out through dolls, and so knowing the dolls wants and desires is not completely out of place.Because 'Barbie Dolls' are manufactured in different kinds of outfits (nurse, pilot, soldier) the film's Barbie-Land heroine, the 'Stereotypical Barbie' (Robbie), believes that real women are equally represented in / by human society. When she learns that is not the case, she travels to the 'real-world' to (a) learn more and (b) help out. What follows is a mish-mash of Barbie-Land male dolls (Gosling) awakening to the benefits of the macho life while its female dolls acquiesce to male demands. That is, until they are awakened by the return of Barbie and some real-world friends. And real-world women's-rights lecturing.At least I think that was what was going on. I say that because while watching the film it had nothing resembling this clarity. So I guess, consciously or otherwise, I thought about it afterward and came up with that theory.My way of saying (a) I could very well be wrong and (b) You might come up with an altogether different interpretation.And I guess that's the answer. Clarity or lack of. That's why I didn't love it.","

Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for. The link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit up.Also, no spoilers, but the Ken bonfires scene made me actually laugh out loud.

Barbie," Honestly - no idea why people are so hyped up with this
",arcelivez-753-983928,10-Aug-23,"Honestly I really have no idea why this movie seems to be so popular. Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...","

",elihebdon,22-Jul-23,"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, l'm in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.","

Barbie could have inspired the real world to be more Barbie-like (example: the movie Enchanted)Barbie could have spent her time in the real world helping the sad girlBarbie could have spent the whole rest of the movie in the real world figuring out who she wanted to beInstead it became an odd war between men and women, which in the end, ended with just as much inequality as there is in the real world but with women in power and men not even having any homes.

It is an all around auteuristic film by the ever great Greta Gerwig, and an instant classic cult film.It provides some excellent comedy, and at the same time some very clever contemporary commentary on feminism and patriarchy from both sides, in Gerwig and Baumbach's usual styles. Very well-written overall.The cinematography is very uqique, one might say characteristic from Gerwig, but it has its own unique weird, twisted style to it. And I love it.Overall, a very fun film that is certainly deserving of all the praise and hype it has gotten.Like last year's ""Everything and Everywhere all att once"", this is truly a genre-bending experience that I very much hope make it to the Oscars.

Barbie," Better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch
",kevin_robbins,21-Jul-23,"Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.This movie is directed by Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Issa Rae (Insecure), Kathryn McKinnon (Bombshell), Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse) and Will Ferrell (Elf).This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated. The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the ""Ken's."" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch.

Barbie," Many Will Go, Most Will Enjoy
",Sarah423,24-Jul-23,"Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie, trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts, I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned.It is not a light-hearted children's film. It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven't taught your daughter the word ""patriarchy"" yet, that might be something to cover first.Second, it's not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I'm not sure how they're signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.---I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.The plot is a weak point, I'll admit, being very simplistic.Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.At any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start)
So there's good news and bad news, and maybe it's cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven. But I thought it was ""OK,"" so here we are.","

Barbie," Dull and disappointing story
",enigma49,20-Jul-23,"First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.Unfortunately there isn't much more to the movie than that. The story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence: Neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women. That's it, that's all.The story revolves around the word ""patriarchy"" with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween, none of which really worked for me. What's left is the empty feeling of lost potential.The main plot element of the first few minutes, the fact that Barbie suddenly isn't perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection (that sounds interesting, right?), is almost completely ignored in favor of what I pointed out above; the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this ""perfect"" Barbieland in the first case. Yes, there's the running gag with Will Ferrell as a CEO and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best. It will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story. If you're lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mind.Then in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical, we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues. How can anyone enjoy this? 4/10 for the style and the acting.","

Barbie," Intelligent and charming
",susand1108,18-Aug-23,"This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.","

I went with my girlfriend and her two daughters and they enjoyed it.The sets were all very very well done. They put a lot of time into them. The acting was awful, but awful on purpose? I'm not sure. The plot was confusing at times. I wasn't sure what that big battle was for. Why were they fighting? No reason or lead up to it was there.I really enjoyed the scenes when they were in the real world. They did good with the 'fish out of water' thing.

Barbie," Life in plastic isn't all that fantastic
",cricketbat,05-Jan-24,"I was looking forward to seeing Barbie. It was on my list of most-anticipated movies and I had heard so many good things about it. But Barbie let me down. I wish that the filmmakers had put as much effort into the screenplay as they did the sets, costumes, and Barbie references. Barbie has a really fun look, but the plot seems like it was cobbled together by seven-year-olds and then coated with a layer of cynicism. Barbie also isn't as humorous as I expected it to be. I think I only laughed out loud once. And most of the jokes feel like lectures. I guess life in plastic isn't all that fantastic.","

Barbie," Goofy, girly, and gorgeous
",aivilovee,25-Jul-23,"I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does.","

Barbie," Well played.
",PK_71,19-Jul-23,"For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part. Well played.","

Barbie," OPP - Eve and Adam
",kosmasp,09-Aug-23,"No pun intended - OPP as in other peoples .... patriarchy! What did you think the last p stood for? Naughty (by nature) are we? Kidding aside, I know that song too and I chose it ... well I would say wisely. Not sure if you think I am hammering anything home here ... I can tell you the movie is! And it did make quite a few people angry - now I understand that one should not count the times you hear the word patriarchy ... won't bode well for you. Also it is quite a lot.But let's get back to the beginning. Why would a grown man even watch a Barbie movie? Well why not? Especially when it begins with one of the best homages to Kubricks 2001 (and Greta has learned quite a bit during her filmmaking career). That said, that completely insane beginning sets a tone - and there is a lot of weird stuff going off here (I think I would be good at beach offs - what do you mean it has nothing to do with the sea and the sand and the ... ohh ... I see)! But that is the point - actually there could have been way more weird stuff - I would have loved it.That said, we do get great actors here - and they all have the same (character) name. Well almost - as easy as it is to remember their names (Ken and Barbie ... sorry Barbie and Ken obviously, lest we forget the star of the movie), is the message of the movie! But and that is what I liked about it more than the almost overbearing message: there is more to discover! You are not or rather you do not have to be what others expect you to be! You are not defined by your significant other (no matter your gender).So while Ken may feel he is nothing without Barbie - well he may go off and do stuff he shouldn't be doing. Like ... (insert a joke about the main point the movie is making and then me explaining something you already know) ... but is it worth it getting hung up on that? Or is it rather better to just enjoy the movie and empower those who never had a voice? Yes a lot of cliches are being thrown around - and the fact many have declared war on ... the movie for no particular reason, makes this even sweeter! They are not even the target audience.There are silly jokes (some aimed at a more grown up audience, like the beach off one), there are references to the doll itself - and there is a lot of comparison. Since this had the green light from Mattel itself it may have to include certain things that are here to shine a good light on them too. Still they don't mind being poked at too (entire board being male for example, a specific doll and much more).Costume and set design is exactly what you would expect - I did not realize the massive budget this had (googled it because a friend mentioned it) .. but it made that money back boxoffice wise and then some.Will Ferrell being the icing on the cake (even if he is unable to catch anything ... even when its right in front of him ... and taking the longest time to get to a beach ... well for obvious timing reasons and very considerate if you think of it) ... a cake that might be pink after all ... hey it once was a color men prefered ... so who knows, things may change one day ... right? (for the better of course)","

",asadkhan0810,11-Aug-23,"The Barbie movie brilliantly brings to life the magical universe of Mattel's iconic Barbie dolls, with Margot Robbie's exceptional portrayal of Barbie herself at the forefront. Robbie's performance is truly remarkable, capturing the essence of the beloved character with grace and charm. Her embodiment of Barbie's timeless appeal and elegance goes beyond mere physical resemblance.Robbie effortlessly transitions between the enchanting Barbieland and the real world, showcasing her versatility as an actress. As she navigates the fantastical landscapes of Barbieland or adjusts to the complexities of the real world, Robbie's portrayal remains captivating and genuine.Supported by Ryan Gosling's charismatic depiction of Ken, the film creates a delightful blend of humor, heart, and subtle social commentary. The visuals are a visual treat, capturing the vibrant beauty of Barbieland and the dynamic real-world settings.Furthermore, the movie subtly touches on various themes, adding depth to the narrative and making it not only entertaining but also thought-provoking.While some viewers might have hoped for a deeper exploration of the dynamics within the Mattel company, the overall experience remains highly enjoyable. The Barbie movie, led by Margot Robbie's outstanding performance, serves as a wonderful celebration of the iconic doll and the values she embodies. It's a must-watch that reignites our fascination with Barbie and leaves us inspired by the boundless possibilities she represents.","

Barbie," Brilliant Filmmaking
",danekera-97717,11-Aug-23,"Finally went to see what this billion-dollar-grossing film was all about and...wow...what an awesome movie. I can see why misogynistic men have spoken very loudly against it.Was it cute? Yeah. Was it funny? Yeah. Was it full of pink and fun songs? Yeah. Was it full of a deep understanding of what women have gone through and...still go through as they try to deal with all of societies pressures...some by other women but most by the patriarchy that still want to see women living the lives they saw on TV growing up? Yeah.I knew the movie nailed it when Barbie and Ken first arrived in the Real World at the beach and he's thrilled to be there and doesn't see the underlying violence. But Barbie does...and she said she could see violence everywhere. Pretty much the same as in real life for women in bars, in dark parking lots, on the streets in broad day light.Lots of in jokes of the history of Barbie (I had a weird Barbie!), lots of adult themes that go over the heads of kids. (One day those little girls will grow up and understand the line ""you can't even beach yourself!"" And it will be funny.)
Probably the most thought out and in-depth analysis of the perils of women trying to have it all...even more than last year's Oscar winner 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' but I'm sure this film won't get that recognition because it's a 'kids' movie based on a toy. But 'Barbie' does a much better job.Go see it. You won't regret it.","

Barbie," Lots of people here say it's ""preachy."" And boy, is it ever!!
",210west,23-Jan-24,"Making a light, entertaining comedy apparently wasn't enough for Gerwig and Baumbach. For some reason -- maybe to maintain their intellectual bona fides -- they couldn't resist weighing the movie down, after its light-hearted beginning, with increasingly serious Messages -- a whole heap of Messages, in fact, about Patriarchy and Feminine Self-Realization and What It Means to Be Human, blah blah blah, to the point where I tuned out all the sermonizing, all the earnest Life Lessons, and was simply grateful for the occasional chuckle.In support of one of its Messages, the filmmakers pretend that the toymaker's managing board is 100 percent male. (It's actually half female.)The high point of the movie comes in the opening minutes. I fell in love with that spot-on ""2001"" parody, even though it feels like an inspired afterthought. (So does Helen Mirren's brief narration.)The entire first third is amusing. After that, it's all downhill. ""Barbie"" becomes increasingly sour and eventually downright tedious. It's at least half an hour too long.I confess to being somewhat baffled by its success, both with critics and the public.","

Barbie," Overrated
",STARONTHETOPOFTHESKY,09-Sep-23,"This movie is a cinematic catastrophe that leaves viewers questioning the very fabric of reality. This film takes a seemingly interesting concept and turns it into an excruciatingly tiresome and overhyped ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.First and foremost, the titular character, barbie, is an annoying and grating presence from the moment she graces the screen. Her incessant whining, exaggerated emotions, and dramatic outbursts quickly wear out their welcome. It's like watching a never-ending loop of a soap opera with no redeeming qualities. Barbie's character is not only unrelatable but also unbearable, making it impossible to invest any emotional connection with her.The premise of a doll coming to life and entering the real world could have been intriguing, but it's executed with such carelessness and lack of creativity that it falls flat. Instead of exploring the endless possibilities of this concept, the movie opts for mind-numbing clichés and uninspired gags. It's as if the writers couldn't be bothered to put any effort into crafting a compelling narrative.The film's overhyped marketing and anticipation only serve to underscore its crushing disappointment. It's as if the marketing team desperately tried to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and the result is a movie that leaves you wondering if you could have spent those precious hours doing something more worthwhile, this movie is a regrettable waste of time and money. Its annoying and one-dimensional protagonist, coupled with a lackluster plot and sluggish pacing, make it a forgettable cinematic experience. I strongly advise against watching this film and suggest looking elsewhere for more fulfilling and entertaining movie options.","

Barbie," Brilliant first part, second part a bit confusing
",the_oak,23-Aug-23,"I loved the first part of this movie. There is a a lot of excitement, wonder, meaning and humor. The main actors are very good and it all seems to be going so well. Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that. I guess it would just be too traditional if that was the conclusion in this movie.","

Barbie," Hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn't meant to entertain
",SureCommaNot,25-Jul-23,"In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn't exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.","

",dililith,13-Aug-23,"It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.The narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood, but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush women's self-esteem.The movie is entertaining , it makes you laugh, has so many characters, you barely get to appreciate all of them. I don't particularly love gosling as ken, I find him too old for the role, but plays well the part.Now the important thing about the movie is the concept. The whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant. It is light enough so you don't get an existencial crisis while watching it, but you'll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problem.That scene with the old lady is endearing, the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener, and ohh, that final joke!

Barbie," Awkward, brilliant, anti-popcorn movie
",grinningelvis,27-Jul-23,"The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.It's a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. It's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It's a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig's best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of Barbie's angst. In that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.","

Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one.

Barbie," Not as clever as it thinks it is
",msbecca00,30-Jul-23,"I went into the film having high expectations, the marketing for Barbie has been really effective, I have to give them that. I had also heard good things about the movie from friends and co-workers. So I went to the cinema with my friend, dressed in pink.I was expecting a funny, girly movie with some clever commentary on patriarchy and existentialism. Instead, I found it to be campy and over the top. Campy can be fun, and there were one or two chuckle-worthy moments. But I wouldn't describe it as a funny comedy. Maybe it's because we're from Northern Europe, but the audience certainly wasn't laughing at many moments. I recall Ryan Gosling causing a few chuckles here and there though, he's got great comedic timing.The social commentary wasn't very subtle, the message was overly clear. It was so exaggerated that I found myself cringing at the lines and scenes. It could've been done much more elegantly, but it's clear that they didn't have high expectations of their audiences' intelligence.But there were some highlights too, of course: Barbieland looked amazing and I loved the costume design. Ryan Gosling was lovable and funny, even as a loser Ken. Margot Robbie was convincing as Barbie. The music fit well.Lastly, I wish I had gone into the movie without any expectations. I probably would've enjoyed it more then. It was relatively entertaining but I don't think that I'll be rewatching it. As a feminist I was disappointed in how on the nose the social commentary was. It could've been done with so much more grace and respect for the audience's intelligence. I also didn't like the way the dialogue was written over all, it was very ""wannabe-intellectual"" which I didn't find to be very funny at all. Maybe it's just the American humor that doesn't suit me.","

I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn't overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn't use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh. It's truly a good time.","

Also think that he main scene in Barbie land was a place with plenty of plastic ware all highly magnified with real actors. She and Ken found a culture shock reaching the real world. Dialogues in the second half were quite deep giving a rather different moral then we cold expect raising the IQ of the movie until the end when barbie took a rather unexpected decision for her future life. Many political projections too definitely a movie for teens than children
Generally the movie was quite bizarre in most of the story. Main actors were quite good
Rating 6/10 the end was more interesting.","

Barbie," Boring bordering on stupid with minor attempts at funny
",sage4676,11-Jan-24,"Yes, it some people like this trash heap, but I was roped into watching this dung heap. Margot is hottie, but other than that, there is no reason for any adult, sane male to watch this junk. My sense of humor has aged with me to the point of silly 'gags' that are supposed to be funny just aren't anymore. Yes, I forced my self to actually finish watching it on Cable so I could at least take a break and get of a leave to find something actually worthwhile eating. As a child, I love my Mattel Hot Wheels while my sister had her Barbies. I tried dolls with 'Major Matt Mason' to go into space. The movie Barbie had a few tracks that were momentarily entertaining but they never lasted for the whole song. Pink was never my favorite color and pretty much the entire movie is in pink. While watching it, I could wait for it to end. It didn't end fast enough.","

Barbie," Deeper than I thought.
",gqkmqmtym,24-Jul-23,"I really thought this would just be a cute movie, but it actually had a very deep message and I really hope people can take the messages away from this movie because there was a few. I think they did great with the Barbie movie. It was entertaining. The special effects were adorable, but the message was so HUGE in this movie.Watching these light fluffy cute reviews, I know most people missed it.First of all, Barbie was very empowering in her own world where she could be anything she wanted and looking her best while doing it AND the men were not needed, NOT IN CHARGE and all The Ken's cared about was whether or not, they received any attention from their Barbie
Sound familiar kept wives? Trophy Wives you have no other purpose except to look incredible for your stupid rich husband. That was Ken.The second she went into the real world. She was cat called had her ass slapped, got arrested for defending herself, and was treated with pretty privilege at the police station all while being treated like a blonde bimbo by people in the street. The complete opposite of Barbieland.I hope that people can take away from Barbie and Ken how the roles were reversed when they went from Barbieland to the real world and you could see Barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while Ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.The teen angst was a good part too. Barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. She has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and Barbieland totally emphasizes that.Even the biggest Barbie was well done up. Dresses well hair done speaks delicately.Everyone there was picture perfect. Dainty and feminine. Even the Supreme Court were beauty pageant champions.This movie is actually deeper than I thought it would be. It was really good I really like Margot Robbie I think she's absolutely adorable as Barbie and I felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box.","

Barbie," I actually enjoyed it
",lisafordeay,22-Jul-23,"Barbie is the latest toy turned movie adapation and stars Margot Robbie(Birds of Prey),Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Alexandra Ship(A Dogs Way Home),Dua Lipa,Will Ferrell(Elf),America Ferrara(Ugly Betty)and Helen Mirren(Shazam Fury Of The Gods) as the narrator.The story follows Barbie(Robbie) who notices strange things happening to her. She thinks about death,her feet are flat and she shows emotions. So she decides to go to weird Barbie (Kate McKennon) for advice and travels to the real world to find her owner Gloria(Ferrara) and her daughter Sasha to find out why she is malfunctioning. But will Barbie choose the real world or the plastic land of Barbie Land?.Overall I actually liked this film .Yes it's very silly and stupid but it was entertaining. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken who is obsessed with horses and prospecy and the other guys as Ken including new Dr Who Ncuti and Secret Invasion star Kingston Ben Adir and Michael Cena as Allan. I guess if I had to change anything it would be for Barbie to stay in the human world more and actually have them as actual Barbie dolls first like Life Size or even Enchanted animated.If you loved Elf(since Will Ferrell stars in both films and the setting mirrors it too) and The Lego Movie along with adding sexual innuendo and woman's rights along with men's rights then you'll enjoy it. Would I recommend 6 year olds to see it no,unless they have a parent.6/10.","

Barbie," The hype this year was fun, the actual movie less so.
",KrustyKrabnz,01-Dec-23,"I was largely disappointed with Barbie and only sat through it in the hope that it would finally live up to its hype. When the final credits rolled the only thing that came to mind was ""So that was it?"".The Barbie Land set design is sometimes incredible and worth a star alone, but the plot and execution of the movie were a huge let down. After a promising start with a few chuckles, it becomes bogged down with negativity and cynicism trying to pass as humor in the completely messy and manic second and third acts. The obnoxious whiny dialogue really lets it down.I'm usually a fan of these fantasy meet reality movies based on iconic characters from popular culture and found the more child friendly Peter Rabbit, Paddington and Smurfs movies to be more mature, coherent, very funny and touching for all ages. Expectations were the same for Barbie, but none of those feelings really surfaced. I do understand on reflection that Barbie was aimed mostly at older viewers (which was probably unfair on the many cinema going younger children), however the attempts at emotion it was trying to achieve for that demographic towards the end felt far too forced, syrupy and unconvincing.Two movies which came to mind while watching Barbie that have some parallels - especially during the LA escapade scenes - were The Brady Bunch movie and Very Brady Sequel from the 1990s. These are more than 25 years older, but are funnier, do a more effective job with the ""real world"" satire and unlike Barbie are worthy of a rewatch. I think it's time to dig those out again and be entertained.","

Barbie," More Than Meets The Eye
",bankofmarquis,21-Jul-23,"The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.As another toy's slogan puts it, ""there's more than meets the eye"" to this film.And one should have expected something more than just a ""surfacey-fun"" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of ""Stereotype Barbie"" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig's direction, Robbie's performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie's counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it's surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it's point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only ""real world"" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It's a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.And, that is the caution to this movie. It's not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis.","

Barbie," A Bit Over-Rated But Still Enjoyable
",sddavis63,16-Dec-23,"My daughter came home from university for Christmas break and wanted to watch the Barbie movie so we rented it from Amazon and had a family movie night. It was better than I was expecting but in my opinion still a little bit over-rated. At almost two hours it was a bit long. The first hour was fun and had me laughing; the second hour - to me at least - started to drag a bit. But it's an enjoyable watch for the most part and leaves me shaking my head the the right-wing menfolk who seemed to think this movie was the end of civilzation as we know it. That says more about their own sense of masculinity than about the quality of the movie.The cast (Margot Robbie was Barnie and Ryan Gosling was Ken was likeable and funny. One way of cutting the over-long runtime would have been to cut out most of the scenes involving the fictional Mattel execs. I did not like them, most of their scenes seemed superfluous and it seemed just a way to give Will Ferrell an acting gig.But overall I'd give the movie a solid 7/10.","

",lisacarlson50,22-Jul-23,"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer.

",Rice-and-Beans34,30-Jul-23,"This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.","

",adsmradford,15-Aug-23,"I doubt this film will be remembered in 80 years. Its no Wizard of Oz. However, it caught the zeitgeist in the summer of 2023. And made its truly talented female director hugely bankable.Barbie (the beautiful Robbie) goes into the real world accompanied by Ken (an almost as beautiful Gosling) her ultimate fashion accessory, when she suffers from strange un Barbie like symptoms. Thoughts of death, flat feet etc. From there views on feminity and masculinity are explored and the everlasting tug of war and power shifts between men and women.Beautifully photographed with magnificent sets. Both will be nominated for Oscars. The leads are top notch, Robbie makes a stunning Barbie and Gosling a hilarious Ken.What Barbie has done has got people back into the cinemas and revitalised the film industry. For that alone it deserves 10. Well done.","

",enesmil,19-Jul-23,"The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.","

",afuschiaperfume,25-Jul-23,"I knew this was going to be political going in but I thought its Barbie so I could overlook it. But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very ""told and not shown"" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?","

Barbie," Meh...
",paul_haakonsen,23-Sep-23,"Well, I have to admit that all the hype around this movie eventually made me sit down to watch it together with my wife and son. And my son quickly lost interest in the movie and left, and I have to admit that my interest in the movie was waning and dissipating about the halfway marker.Yeah, this movie is seriously over-hyped and it is amped up to be all that and then some, when, in fact, it wasn't all that and a bag of potato chips. I found the storyline in the movie to be rather bland and pointless, and thus found very little entertainment in the movie. And that made sitting through 114 minutes of it quite the ordeal. Yet, I managed to endure, because I wanted to see if there was anything to the hype. So writers Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach didn't exactly impress me with this movie.There wasn't!Sure, the movie had a good cast ensemble, and there were some fair performances. But it was just difficult to abhor from the lack of an interesting storyline and script to enjoy the acting performances.Visually then director Greta Gerwig certainly managed to make it look and feel like it took place in Barbieland, with all the vibrant colors, toy-like appearances of things. So that definitely helped to make things a bit more bearable to sit through.""Barbie"" is not a childrens movie, which you would otherwise assume from a movie based on Mattel's popular doll line.Right, well I can check ""Barbie"" off of the watched-movie list now, and I can honestly say that I am never returning to watch it a second time. And if this movie spawns a sequel, I doubt it very much that I will actually sit down to watching it.My rating of ""Barbie"" from director Greta Gerwig's 2023 movie ""Barbie"" lands on a four out of ten stars.","

And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything.

His sequences were the most memorable for me, which is something I never expected myself to say. His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn't the problem. It's just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn't go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn't even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.Ken stole the show for the most part. Also, the song ""I'm just Ken"" should be nominated for the academy's ""Best Original Song"" award. It's just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creative.The story overall could have been better.","

They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).Then there's the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I've seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it.

Barbie," Good Enough
",PennyReviews,03-Aug-23,"Barbie is a fun summery movie for all ages.It tells the story of the doll Barbie who has to go into the real world to find her girl owner after she starts behaving oddly for a Barbie doll. That is the main prompt of the movie, which quickly takes a new turn all together, focusing on Ken and turning the tables on gender and how men and women are presented in films and in art in general (not to mention how their are treated in real world). That social commentary was spot on, under the light of more comical lences that makes it more appetizing and easily digestable. However, the movie does get close to being over preachy, loosing its initial main idea. That could have been solved by making the movie a little longer, giving the plot space to smoothly develop and have all those features handled in a better way. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have that, thus, the result is an overstuffy, half baked plot.On the other hand, the performances were enjoyable, with Gosling trully shining in this one. The mood and costumes were also spot on.","

Barbie," Exceeds Expectations
",asayed-63121,23-Jul-23,"If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it's regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. 'I am just Ken' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.","

Barbie," Half a Movie
",Hitchcoc,01-Jan-24,"So much has been said about this film. It made huge amounts of money and had an incredible start at the box office. I wanted to see it, but the stars didn't align. Since I had read no reviews and had not talked to anyone who had seen it, I went in quite objectively. Our kids had a Barbie or two around the house, but they didn't rule their world. That said, I think I'm a pretty open minded movie viewer. This film is far from the phenomenon the press made it out to be. I enjoyed the incredible sets and recreations of the pink world. Also, the introduction to that world and all the Barbies and Kens was quite amazing. As others have said, however, is that it becomes wordy and preachy in the final third. I started looking at the clock which is not a good sign. The cast is good, although Ryan Gosling isn't dull enough to be Ken. He is never boring, even at the beginning. I'm glad I saw this because it is a cultural phenomenon (even though it doesn't deserve it). The message is a good one and spot on. It's just delivered in a less than stellar way.","

I gave up before reaching the halfway point and just FF to the end to see how this dreadful, celluloid abomination would end but had to give up again before doing that. How anyone could see this once let alone several times has left me flabbergasted and flummoxed to the nth degree. I didn't even crack a smile once. As awful as anything can be.

",justahunch-70549,17-Sep-23,"I am amazed at the enormous success of this film. I'm not implying that it is a bad movie, but it's just a fun film based on dolls. It certainly is different and kind of unique with a pretty wonderful opening along with a fascinating production design, but ya gotta love pink! It's all about feminism and patriarchy and it's a little heavy handed about both of those topics, but it makes its points. While it's not a great film, it took some great talent to make this odd idea work and I am referring specifically to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach who provide some funny and witty moments. In my opinion, both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both too old for their roles, but they pull it off quite well. While it looks and feels like a children's film some of the time since this is about dolls, it's message is for adults, though children would appreciate a lot of it without really getting it, so to speak. It also has some really good choreography and a very nice song by Billie Eilish who I am kind of surprised doesn't appear in this at some point, though Will Ferrell does, which is a shame as he is his usual annoying self, but that's just me. I've never understood his appeal.","

Barbie," Overrated, could have been much better
",comedyfan71,05-Dec-23,"Barbie is really not a good film. The IMDB rating is pretty flattering, although I have seen far worse films.In terms of what I liked; I thought the set design and colour scheme were nice. It did have a couple of funny moments.Other than that I can't praise the film too much. The acting isn't bad but the what was needed was good writing, which this film severely lacks. It's all over the place and doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.As a comedy movie it's not very funny, as mentioned I laughed maybe 2 or 3 times but overall it feels more like a drama. The message is deep and not befitting of a comedy film based off of a beloved children's toy. It is also quite long, nearly 2 hours in length, and it is not a very enjoyable experience in my opinion.Maybe I'm just not the target audience for this film, but I can't see too many positives about it.","

Barbie," 10/10!!!!!!!
",meltingmel,21-Jul-23,"Wow. WOW!!!!My favorite movie of all time is Aliens. It's been my favorite movie since I was 5-years-old. I'm 38 now. That has NEVER changed.Until THIS.And I bet you are thinking this review is satire. It's NOT.I'm BLOWN away. Barbie is now my favorite movie of all time - successfully unseating Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I never thought I would see the day.The movie makes you think it's going to be just a fun, silly movie to mock. NO. It's not. It's brilliantly written. It's written so well that all the adult messaging goes right over the little kids heads but still gives them plenty of enjoyment.The movie sparked really great discussion with my daughter who is 8-years-old. We discussed why it's so important to value ourselves and what the patriarchy is. It's just... mind blowingly good.And also - a good reminder to all women. WE ARE ENOUGH. We are good enough. And we need to raise our daughters to be confident and leaders if that's the path they choose.","

Barbie," Boring Movie
",sriya-76870,19-Jul-23,"Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting. He's the one who was gripping the movie. You will get to know about lot of Barbie you didnt know about.There will be moments where you'll be like whats going on? Why am i here ? Why didn't i book the tickets for oppenheimer early but this too shall pass.","

Barbie," Kentastic!
",jaysnewish,05-Aug-23,"I honestly thought I have to see what the hype was all about but I'd go when the buzz has dies down but after not being able to get the ""I'm just Ken"" song out of my head for a couple of weeks I gave in and I'm glad I did...I really enjoyed it! This movie isn't just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if ""I'm just Ken"" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can't find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him. I definitely highly recommend this movie it's an enjoyable watch and a great pick me up smile on face movie.","

Barbie," Very mixed
",ChipGard95,28-Jul-23,"The start was a wonderfully fun look at Barbies & Kens in Barbieland but I felt that it was a bit abrupt when Barbie out of nowhere had thoughts of death would've made more sense for her to notice signs of imperfection first then thoughts of death.Film doesn't hate men I actually really enjoyed how they handled Ken by showing how it is so easy for society to corrupt young teen men with people like Andrew Tate etc. Although ending was bad, why not have Kens and Barbies in charge together as going in the real world showed that men running it was bad & Barbieland was only a utopian for the Barbies. At one point Barbie is asked where do the Kens sleep and she thinks for a moment before saying ""I don't know"" then that's it we never learn, basically her saying ""I don't know and I don't care."" They did so well showing Ken's feelings of being inadequate, inferior and almost like a toy for Barbie to play with when she wanted and yet they just end with the Barbies taking back control of Barbieland, they give Ken's low level government jobs because they should struggle like woman. So, the message is it's okay for one gender to have to fight, claw and struggle for anything good as long as it's men?Also this is entire my own preference and has no fault of story but most of the cast was a bit rubbish for me anyway. It was as if the casting director watched some British shows and picked actors from, like did we really need 3 sex education actors all of which were pretty bland?","

Barbie," An Ode to the Love of Cinema
",gilliandawe91,10-Aug-23,"Wow. I saw this movie on July 23rd and I've been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI. Set Dec is 10/10Next, I have to talk about Greta Gerwig's clear love of cinema. From the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001: A Space Odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed, to a hilarious Matrix reference, and then the overarching clear love of old Hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals. The dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute BLAST!Then there is the acting. It almost feels wrong to say it, but there's no denying that Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. His comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we haven't gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty. Margot Robbie is absolute perfection, the most obvious casting for Barbie ever in the history of the world, but don't let that fool you. Her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here. She really is one of the best actor of this generation. The rest of the cast also absolutely kills it. America Ferrera Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Will Farrell, etc etc etc, everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance. Acting is 10/10THE MUSIC!!!! It is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original Barbie album for this film. I'm not always a hard pop music kind of person, but it went so perfectly with this film, that I had to order myself a vinyl copy. But best of all, Ryan Gosling's performance in ""I'm Just Ken."" The dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious. I can only pray that it is nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem, can you imagine it?!? Music is 10/10And finally, the script. See how I managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on? This script is hilarious, SO smart and witty, and deeply poignant and emotional. It hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years. I love that even though Barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywhere(I personally did not find that to be the case for me, I was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me) we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll, all of her careers, the fact that there was an Astronaut Barbie before there was a woman working at NASA, etc. Then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy!! If anything in this movie seemed false or offended you, I don't even know what to tell you. This felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman. So many women have shared America Ferrera's monologue, and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie. And I say that as a big Matchbox Twenty fan!All in all, this movie for me is a masterpiece, it's stunning, hilarious, emotional and the most fun I may ever have had in a movie theatre. Cannot recommend strongly enough! Easily my favourite movie of 2023, can't imagine how anything else could come close.","

Barbie," Sly and litely amusing
",gortx,11-Aug-23,"Greta Gerwig's mildly sly take on the doll myth works more on the margins than directly. Here, a ""Stereotypical Barbie"" (Margot Robbie) and a seemingly stock Ken (Ryan Gosling), end up questioning the standard Barbie myth.Of course, when it's a $150M feature (with an equal amount for advertising) based on a mega-brand toy, one can't expect a truly subversive film. Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach mostly settle for some gentle barbs and lots of winks and nods right from the pre-credits sequence. The screenplay takes elements of Toy Story/Lego Movie, Stepford Wives/Don't Worry Darling/Get Out and the Pinocchio legend to tell it's tale. Most of the funnier bits are the asides.The most enjoyable aspect here is the candy-colored Barbie-land designed by Sarah Greenwood, outfitted by Jacqueline Durran and photographed by Rodrigo Prieto. The assortment of other Barbies and Kens including Alexandra Shipp, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae along with Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena and more also bring wide-eyed joy to their roles. Michael Cena is amusing as the Non-Ken, Allan.Less successful is the ""real world"" with the exception of America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt as a mother and daughter, and, most especially, Rhea Perlman as Ruth (although the movie fails to mention that she was not only a tax cheat, but also stole Barbie from a German doll). Curiously, once they enter Barbie-land, Greenblatt's Sasha loses much of her real-world bite. More damaging are Will Farrell and his hench-men from the Mattel corporation. They are simply low rent buffoons who add little save for padding out the running time. Occasionally, one is reminded of all those lesser SNL based films where a decent sketch is stretched out to feature length. It's clever if too on the nose and obvious most of the time. Nothing exemplifies this as Ferrera's monologue about how it's ""impossible to be a woman."" It's well written and beautifully delivered by the actress, but, it feels out of place in a movie where the wittiest and sharpest material up until then have been half-whispered digressions, winks and nods. It's the one time the subtext takes center stage and it sticks out all the more because of that.The ending is rather sweet. BARBIE is about as good as one could reasonably expect from a studio concoction with Gerwig et al. Delivering an enjoyable lite entertainment.",NA
Barbie," Weird, Funny And Thought Provoking
",stevendbeard,20-Jul-23,"I saw Barbie, starring Margot Robbie-Babylon, the Suicide Squad movies; Ryan Gosling-Blade Runner 2049, La La Land; America Ferrera-Superstore_tv, Ugly Betty_tv; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016 and Will Ferrell-Holmes & Watson, the Daddy's Home movies.This is a weird, funny and thought provoking movie about a doll that was created in 1959 by Ruth Handler. Before the movie starts, there are several music videos with singers and stars from the film. The movie then goes straight to Barbie Land, where everything is pink-Barbie's favorite color-and everyone sings and dances a lot. Margot is the main Barbie-there are lots of them, of course, as well as Kens-and Ryan is the main Ken. Everything is going along like usual for Margo until she starts having visions of death and despair. The rest of the Barbies tell her to consult with Kate-the weird Barbie-and Kate tells her that she must go to the real world and find out the source of her problems. Ryan goes with her and they both discover that in the real world, it's not run by Barbies but instead by men. Will plays the CEO of Mattel and America is his secretary. There are messages about feminism and the role of the Barbie doll in shaping little girls' minds-both good and bad-and there are several cameos of actors you may recognize, as Ken and Barbie.It's rated PG-13 for some language and some sexual innuendo-mostly just jokes-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.Although I would probably not buy it on DVD, it is entertaining and would be a good one to stream.","

Barbie," Overhyped Mattel Commercial for Plastic Dolls
",lambiepie-2,16-Dec-23,"I waited to see this on MAX to experience all the commotion, and if they never made the film ""Bolero,"" this would rank as the worst film ever made for me.From the DEI Barbies to the tack-on mean girl junior high school girls (btw, with the way I actually feel about these pieces of plastic), to the Barbie rules the world crap.Then they leave the playland and look at the real world, and Ken finds out it is not a secondary piece of plastic but a ruler of the world; tries to change their playland, and the Barbies revolt or something akin to it so all of this was boiled down to hogwash.The acting was..acting. I felt nothing for anything, and the preachy ending was overblown. And I thought Mattel had pasted together old 70s ""After School Special"" or ""Johnathan Livingston Seagull"" -ish clips to give some feeling. I got tired of hearing the Mattel brand name; it grew tiresome, and the accessories to the pieces of plastic they used as consumerism at its best. The only thing I liked was the end credits going through Mattel's plastic products associated with Barbie - and I loved seeing the dog that pooped.It didn't grab me; I didn't find it funny anywhere. It went from the most annoying opening to as far as one can get annoying in every second of this film. The music was shallow; the production design teetered on Terry Gilliam's work but without the imagination or talent, and old 1920s/1930s film backgrounds and old Three Stooges routines were very tiring.This film was not for me or my demographic; it is for Barbie lovers, and to be honest, when my mom bought me one, I set her blonde hair on fire and ran her over on my Big Wheel, so maybe that had something to do with it.I gave it a view through and can never honestly get that time back. A solid 1 for me.","

",saimariejohnson,07-Aug-23,"Barbie surprised me in all the best ways. It was funny, moving, inspirational, and all around ridiculously entertaining. I mean that with every sense of the implication to.There were moments that everyone could relate to the film - at least as I observed, and it was heartfelt in delivery and message. Some of the narrator quirks delivered by Helen Mirren are just perfect and I found myself laughing more than anything else.There are so many nuanced things that make the movie so sweet but the best is probably the nod to the original creator of Barbie and the reason the doll was produced to start.","

Barbie," Only for Margot Robbie.....
",shaikhirshad-41223,31-Jul-23,"This movie is specially for those who loves the character of barbie specially in childhood. This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....","

Barbie," I fee sorry to those who fell in the Barbenheimer trap
",Azureus91,20-Jul-23,"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.","

Barbie," Love it!
",rgxdzrybr,08-Feb-24,"When I think of what Greta Gerwig , Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and the rest accomplished I can't believe it.There are so many ways this could have gone wrong but it ends up a culture phenomenon!Ryan Gosling has to be the most versatile actor working today. He's a later day Jack Lemmon. I can't wait to see what he does next.I love that it's a fun movie with deeper meaning. It's not strictly about women but it focuses on the impossible expectations placed on women.Ken represents what women often have be relegated to and searching for his own identity.Kate McKinnon's Barbie represents what women face when everyone decides they don't measure up but who do they all turn to to fix things? .
Allan is the overlooked one which many can identify with. Finally America's speech captures the frustrations.Highly enjoyable and emotional at the same time.","

Barbie," Witty, funny but severly sterotypical
",trinculodino,19-Jul-23,"A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing.","

Barbie," Much Ado About Malibu...
",ThurstonHunger,21-Aug-23,"Finally stepped into the Barbie-verse with my wife and sons. The film is both simple and ambitious, which deftly allowed us to enjoy on a variety of levels. Probably best for you to see this before too long, and before you hear too much (indirectly or incorrectly) about the film imho.Plenty of humor, cinematography and music. Notably the humor is often taking a good look in the mirror and then making a self-deprecating joke. That is quite a trick mirror for the old notion of Barbie. All four in our family shed a few tears at times, the film's plastic fantastic elastic aspects cast aside, there's a sweet heart beating beneath it all.I'm not just talking about the ""you go girl"" vibe that one would expect and is definitely delivered. Ryan Gosling's Ken-ergy steals scenes but will he steal the vote in Barbieland? Personally, I don't buy the idea of this as an anti-man movie.Yet it is a feminist movie, built from a base of durable individuality.Another trick turned by this new Barbie is to take the old production line uniformity and humanize each of the many Barbies in this film. And yes, even Alan too!Tempted to title this review as ""God Bless America"" as America Ferrera nails the most vital message here in a wonderful monologue. Ferrera really is excellent in this. The movie could become a Mother's Day tradition in a lot of homes.You can find that monologue online along with so many other intricacies that went into this film, like who the lovely lady at the bus stop is in real life, and the fact that Margo Robbie via her Lucky Chap company chose Greta Gerwig and not vice-versa. That was a Frances A-Ha moment for me!The last line of the film was a different kind of a-ha moment, a touch or two of humor but also maybe the one uniting aspect for a very diverse Barbie-verse of feminists.","

Barbie," ABUSE OF THE BARBIE
",silvangigerstudio,25-Jul-23,"Here's the thing.In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.","

A lot of thought went into this and it's not just for women it's for anybody. We all need an Allan in our life. I could've used more boardroom ceo scenes with will farrel and his men tho. It's lovely to see the perspective of both men and women and at the end of the day what I got from this movie is about how we're each wanting to find our happiness and who we are outside of someone else.,"

Barbie," Anyone Remember the Film ""Life Size""?
",JayWolfgramm,24-Jan-24,"From a far, I can see why people would absolutely hate this movie. Just the concept of ""Barbie: The Movie"" is enough to make people feel like the art of cinema has been compromised by corporate America. But, as a whole, this movie was very well received. It made over a billion dollars at the box-office and was nominated for 8 Oscars including ""Best Picture"", so clearly it some people really liked it.There is a lot to enjoy in this film. The movie does a good job with poking fun at the Barbie brand without it feeling too much like a spoof. This is a comedy, so the fact that the film is really funny is kind of an important element. Understandably comedy is a subjective thing, so all I can say is for me, I laughed out loud several times through the movie. The movie is clever in how it treats its ""worldbuilding"" and nicely avoids any firm answers about how this world works. Because, yeah, if you think about that sort of stuff in the film there is a LOT that doesn't add up.It is nice that they don't spend too much time in ""the real world"" and focus on the creative fun of ""Barbie World"". The movie is more visually unique and can do more gags when that is the case.When the movie is focusing on being a bizarre comedy, that is when some of the best and most memorable things happen. When it tries to have a more serious message, that is where it loses some momentum. Don't misunderstand me, the movie needs some serious stuff in order to make the comedy work. And the stuff with Ugly Betty and her daughter is good emotional stuff. But towards the end, they realize that Barbie needs to have a character arc and feel like they tack one on last second. There are some very funny jokes towards the end, but it does become a little repetitive and the message feels heavy handed by the 5th time it's brought up. Side note: I wanted a cameo from the voice actress of Barbie, Kelly Sheridan, but she wasn't there.I will emphasize this because Hollywood will learn all the wrong lessons from this movie's success. We do not want a ""Polly Pocket"" movie or an ""Uno"" movie. What made this film a success, beyond its brand or its marketing campaign, is that it was uniquely Greta Gerwig's vision. The movie wasn't concerned with mass audience appeal, it would tell jokes that they thought were funny and hoped others would enjoy as well. If you want to duplicate Barbie's success, give creative people control to make some out there stuff.Wrapped in plastic, it's fantastic.","

Barbie," Not so Jolly Dolly
",Lejink,04-Feb-24,"So, last weekend my wife and I watched the Oppen part of the ""Barbenheimer"" 2023 box-office two-headed monster and this week it was Barbie's turn. From the little I'd incidentally read in advance about the day-glo billion dollar blockbuster, I was expecting some kind of retro-cool, existentialist, post-modernist satire on the battle of the sexes, consumerism and childhood buffed up with a little diversity along the way, but somehow with all these ducks lined up in a row, I felt the film missed the mark.It starts brightly with eye-candy sets in fifty shades of pink as we're introduced to Margot Robbie's Barbie in her Barbie-world of alternative Barbies, see through doll's houses and their various incomplete consumer goods, for example our girl has her daily dry-shower and drinks non-existent tea. Everything appears to be perfect in her / their perfect world, unless you're the boyfriend Ken, here also in a variety of forms, all doomed to exist only in Barbie's slipstream and so experience recurring frustration at getting precisely nowhere, all the time, with the object of his / their, I hesitate to call it, desire.Then things start to go wrong for Robbie's ""Stereotypical"" Barbie. She thinks of death and starts to malfunction and after a visit to Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie, a concept I have to say I didn't get at all, she determines to go to the real world to connect with the disillusioned Mattel employee, played by America Ferrera, whose negativity, channelled through her disinterested daughter Ariana Greenblatt, is upsetting the living doll's equilibrium. Ryan Gosling's wheedling Ken is also along for the ride and stows away in her Penelope Pitstop-mobile and together they head for L. A., where Ferrera lives, the headquarters of the manufacturer Mattel.For me, the film went downhill fast from there with Ken's head getting messed-up with perceptions of patriarchy while Barbie has a meltdown over her identity-crisis. There are unfunny, over-played scenes where Barbie experiences humiliation at the hands of Greenblatt and her school chums, traipses down to Mattel HQ to confront the all-male board of directors headed by a mis-cast Will Ferrell as the company CEO, before returning to Barbie-world with Ferrera and Greenblatt in tow to take down Ken's new-model Kendom where outdated male-superiority is literally back in the saddle.I have to admit, I got very bored, very soon with this empty, supposedly satirical high-concept, fantasy-comedy. A world box-office of 1.5 billion dollars and eight Oscar nominations actually makes me wonder if I've not switched places too with Barbie-world as I'm afraid nothing about the movie, including the soundtrack and unsuccessful attempts at either comedy or pathos (especially when they wheel in Rhea Perlman as the doll's now-enlightened creator) all missing me by miles.When at one point, all her namesakes shout ""Go Barbie!', I must admit I was with them 100% but for completely different reasons.","

Barbie," It's Cute, But Definitely Overhyped
",njamesgentry,17-Sep-23,"Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie. Of course she's incredibly beautiful, talented, funny, and hip; however, I didn't have some life-altering epiphany, like so many others did. I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, ""Why can't Barbie just sing a song?!"" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis. It was depressing at times. The cast was phenomenal, of course. I just didn't expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling.","

Barbie," Barbie is fun, but gets too focused on the social commentary and does not do the plot justice.
",saadhasan-36609,23-Jul-23,"Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.","

Barbie," Overrated and sad
",SarahAppleSauce98,08-Oct-23,"I saw this recently on streaming after hearing so much hype about how it was so important and such an incredible movie. After I watched it I wondered if I'd ordered the wrong movie. The whole thing was just lame unfunny jokes, a convoluted plot line, bland acting and mixed messaging which seems to be trying to be positive for women but are unintentionally negative - especially at the end with how the Barbies trick the Kens, I mean is the positive message for my daughter meant to be to exploit men by buttering them up? Er what?Reviews for this were glowingly positive and I pretty much disagreed with all of them, but even the negative reviews praised the set design and Barbie land, personally I didn't see the big deal, like they copied how the dream houses look and made a set of it. Whoopty do.The two stars are mostly for Ryan Gosling and Allan (I forget the actors name) as they were the best part of the movie, even though Gosling Ken strolling was sad to me. Which is ironic given it was meant to be a movie about empowering women.Disappointing and I expect this movie to be re evaluated as bad in the future.","

",jamalb-38618,29-Jul-23,"I watched this movie expecting something else, but after the movie was finished I was not expecting so much humor, emotional rollercoasters, and a lot of Barbies with Kens. The last scene where Barbie wants to be a human had me almost in tears. I felt different in the heart as well. The soundtrack was also amazing as well. I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not ""Blame Mattel"" lol. The Mattel jokes had me laughing every time they were brought up. I couldn't have asked for a better comedy movie for the summer.","

Barbie," Disturbing, but I couldn't turn away
",kendallschristopher,16-Dec-23,"This is a very bizarre, very weird movie. Basically Ken gets motivated by the idea of the patriarchy once he visits the real world but only went to the real world because of Barbie, who was there because of the woman that still plays with Barbie was depressed and, yeah, whatever. Oh and Mattel is run completely by men.I always wondered what a Barbie films storyline would look like. But this makes Barbie sound like a diversion to play into the fantasies of progressive, feminist, women. And maybe it is maybe it isn't. Mattel is making a serious case for the legitimacy and relevancy of Barbie, and the movie is really a two hour commercial for the toy. But it's worth it to explore dynamics between women and men. Who is in control of relationships, how men and women really need each other for more than just families and reproduction.In doing so we are back to the patriarchy and old fashioned traditional all American values but maybe that is all that life was ever about anyway. But then when the movie makes its point it gets away from itself, runs too long and gets campy again.The bigger picture is that Barbie, the film, gives us that movie magic we took for granted. And that's why I think it was so successful. It gives us something that has been missing from cinema for a while. But it is still a mediocre movie. Seven out of 10 for transcending that mediocrity at different times, but only seven out of ten for it's rhetoric. If women are given a choice, they'll probably want to remain in Barbie Land.","

Barbie," Had me smiling all the way through
",a-hilton,23-Jul-23,"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.","

Barbie," Surprisingly great
",medekfan,08-Aug-23,"Barbie the movie was much better and with more character, story quality and depth than I expected. I went into the movie to see what the fuss was about and for a bit of something fun to do and left feeling happy the rest of the day, thinking about its story a lot, the interesting execution and styling. I also played the soundtrack which has some great songs.To me movie turned out to not be preachy or about being feminist. I think the people who think so are misinterpreting that. At its heart, and this movie does have heart, it ties to Mattel's slogan and concept for Barbie products - You Can Be Anything. It's about finding out who you are and feeling empowered to be yourself, whatever that may be.It's a unique style of film and one I thoroughly found myself enjoying. I find myself wanting to see it again already.If you're in doubt whether to go and see this movie go, if you are like me and some other reviewers I've seen you may come away feeling glad you did.",NA
Barbie," Good but not that good.
",ilikelickingeyeballs,23-Jul-23,"The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a ""woke"" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!","

The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up.

Barbie," Loved The Barbie Doll As A kid, Loved The Barbie Movie As An Adult
",SAMTHEBESTEST,21-Jul-23,"Barbie (2023) :
Movie Review -Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.RATING - 6/10*","

Barbie," It would be nice if Barbie wasn't a children's character
",Skipfishh,14-Nov-23,"I know they're going to curse me, but I didn't think this film was as good as the rating it has here (7.0).The first 5 or 10 minutes (introduction) before the credits are wonderful, a very well thought out joke based on the introduction of ""2001: a space odyssey"", I got the feeling that a great film was coming. But it was pure illusion.First, I'd like to praise Margot Robbie's performance, truly sublime, she carries the film alone, as the rest leaves a lot to be desired. It leaves something to be desired as comedy, romance and fantasy, as a political, social and existentialist content, and, above all, as a children's film.I found the very inclusive cast excellent, but the ideological proposal of 90% adult fantasy, from the sarcastic jokes, through the existentialist issues of life and death, to the political and social themes, leaving the fantasy, lightness and romance in a plane below zero, everything in the film was made for a 14+ audience, well above Barbie's native audience. Not that I don't consider the themes interesting, yes, I like adult jokes and I value important gender and other agendas, and, yes, here in Barbie they should be included, but as subliminal themes to spark interest in a child, and not as an adult fantasy script.And why do I say that? Because my 5-year-old daughter, like many girls between 4 and 10 years old, has always been a fan of Barbie, she has watched all the cartoons more than 20 times each one, and when for the first time a live action version of the beloved doll appears, it's not made for children brains. It's difficult, for example, to explain to my daughter the fun of a joke about plastic and real vaginas and penises, or why Barbie melancholically philosophizes about death, or so many other things on that adult level of sarcasm that the film proposes. Disappointing.","

Barbie," A darkly satirical look at gender structure in society
",MrDHWong,21-Jul-23,"""Barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than Mattel's Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""Barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""Kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""Barbies"". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken's desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland's populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There's even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie's Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling's version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn't the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There's just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""Barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.I rate it a solid 9/10.","

Even in LA, if you dress up as B&K, you will not get many compliments. Some of the costumes were nice and beautiful. Good to see different versions of Barbie over several generations.Story was not very strong, but this is more a visual show than anything. Not surprised that the ending ended with Barbie in control, although the visit to the ObGyn was out of the blue. Still cannot see what the connections were.

Barbie," Great for the ladies, but Kens stay away
",abeburnett,21-Jul-23,"Oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.The biggest problem with this movie is that it leans HARD into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by MEN (as if we're some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugated-talk about intellectually lazy) AND the only acceptable man is an Allen (wimpy effeminate man). This movie could've provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but NO. Instead in the final act, it chooses sides. And the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the ""equity"" side. The side of ""well, do unto others as you FEEL (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they've done unto you."" You feel like the Kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. Never mind the Barbies oppressed the Kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. But no, the Kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. Equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, Kens, must pay.While I laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end I felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. If they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would've been a 10/10, but they couldn't resist making it propaganda. I guess the joke's on me for taking our girls to it.Also, there's a monologue in the third act which could've been BRILLIANT, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how ALL HUMANS feel (not just women, men too). Every man I've ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. It's not just a woman thing.Oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie. It just didn't line up with who Barbie was, and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occur.In the end, THIS KEN (me) cannot recommend this film to other Kens. Unless you're the kind of liberal / progressive man who believes the whole ""women are oppressed"" narrative. Then you'll probably love it. Every other guy though? Or the women who love them? I'd recommend taking a pass on this one. Or watch the first 75% and then leave.Bottom line this is every bit as ""toxic"" as some forms of masculinity. This is just ""toxic feminism."" And I say that as a feminist.","

",ben-snooks,08-Jan-24,"I had trouble following this story. I got the general idea but the dialog seemed to be all over the place. In a nutshell the story is as follows. Barbie senses someone is feeling bad in the real world then leaves Barbieland to try to make the person feel better about themselves. Meanwhile Ken discovers that men have more power in the real world than in Barbieland so when he goes back he rallies the other Ken dolls to take power by force. Meanwhile the Barbie's decide to stand up for themselves and take Barbieland back. Somehow there's some middle ground resolution which didn't seem to make sense. The end. I didn't laugh once so I'm not sure where the comedy aspects were. I was also disappointed when Ken and Barbie broke out into song in the final act. It seems that whenever Hollywood has a bad story then they turn it into a musical. This film was as shallow and one dimensional as a plastic doll who can't bend their knees. The characters were so boring. Nothing much happens and then I was just left waiting for the film to finish. I don't expect this film to win many awards. It was more of an idea than a film with substance. I suppose it's one saving grace was that it's very much in line with American consumerism and patriotic to the 1980's American ideals of beach culture and beauty. The film manages to capitalise and celebrate the bright 1980's fluorescent colour palette that was shovelled at teenage girls in the era, ala slap bands, rollerblades, Alf and fruity loops cereal. However, Barbie as a character seems to be stuck in the 1980's and is really outdated and boring in the 2020's. Some things should be left to age gracefully into history. Especially, a stiff plastic doll without much personality.","

Barbie," Heart-warming, serious and such an important movie for everyone to see!
",bm230199,22-Jul-23,"When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.","

Barbie," Fun soundtrack , story a bit confusing
",luffha,23-Jul-23,"I loved the music , and the fun start.A bit of cheeky humor , and dance choreography.The story was quite confusing, it felt like being glued with superglue and not consistent from the beginning to the end . The ending was quite weird . And switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense . The character from the Mattel management did not add any value to the story . If they were edited out , I think no one would even notice a difference .The main male character has done a good job , especially in his macho phase .The female main character was lovely . Absolutely gorgeous and well played .","

Barbie," Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.
",anniebleasdale-97708,23-Jul-23,"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!","

Barbie," Clever, dazzling, but somewhat incoherent
",bobyule,26-Jul-23,"On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made it to about two-thirds of the way through.","

Barbie," I wanted love with this movie...
",catkins777,10-Feb-24,"But I didn't. There were many things to like: the cast, the costumes, the Barbieland set and props. There were some funny moments.It's so unfortunate, especially having been a long time Barbie fan and my kids loving Barbie toys/animated movies.This movie is not for kid Barbie lovers. It's just not. I found myself pausing the movie because the kids were lost in the myriad of confusing themes.I have to say the movie was rather disappointing. It started out strong, fun and funny. Then turned into a dark disappointment.Female empowerment and the poke at men/patriarchy was somewhat refreshing. Men have long sexualized women in movies so it was nice to see the reversal.I'm not sure the Director or the script could decide on which message they wanted; so they tried to cram all social issues into one movie.The second half became clunky and weird. The ending was particularly disheartening, instead Barbie taking what she learned, returning to Barbieland and effecting change in her world...she chose stay in the real world.Barbie needed to end more fun, upbeat and positive. Ultimately, the audience is left feeling preached at, judged and wondering what the hell just happened.","

When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was thinking there is no way this movie will be any good! Well I am happy to say that I am wrong because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Margot Robbie was great as Barbie while Ryan Gosling was great as Ken!

Barbie," Doesn't hold up to the hype
",glumski,24-Oct-23,"Barbie is a good movie. The visuals are nice to look at, the premise is quirky, the dialogues are often witty, it's somewhat self-aware, and even (some of) the songs are pretty great. It made me laugh, it made me smile, and that's great.And yet... it's definitely not a great movie. From what I'd gathered, it's supposed to be a pointed satire that will quickly become a corner stone of gender equality. Instead, it's overly preachy, reductionist, occasionally fails to see the point, and only repeats a message that countless other movies have raised before in much more elaborate manners.The largest problem, though, is the lack of a clear target audience. There are many series and movies that are primarily focused towards children but that can be appreciated by adults as well. Barbie certainly doesn't fit in this regime; I heavily doubt that many children will care about this heavy-handed discussion of an essential adult topic. And yet it is also a bit too silly to properly work as a movie that's targeted at adults.If the movie had come out two decades ago, it would've been brave, and we would be more easily able to forgive it its many flaws. But this is 2023, where women's rights are actively backsliding in large parts of the world, and where the primary issue of gender equality is no longer man vs woman but binary vs pluralistic.Nevertheless, Barbie is a fun movie. Parts of it are fantastic. It's much better than anything we could've expected from a Barbie movie. It just isn't the ultimate social critic it was portrayed as.","

Barbie," A haphazardly thrown together storyline without any real plot
",rebeccaxjan,27-Aug-23,"1 point lost for the storyline, it lacked a clear/meaningful plot that the viewer can use to surmise the movie at the end.1 point lost for the sub-storylines, which were used to haphazardly throw together the main storyline. But none of these sub-storylines truly resolved or offered the viewer any closure.1 point lost for the poorly made costumes - the Barbie cowgirl pants werd ill-fitting and made of cheap material. It's Barbie - you don't skint in fashion.1 point lost for the casting of non-value add supporting characters which just contributed to more confusion on an ill-defined plot.1 point lost for the absence of key characters from the Barbieworld, these include Kelly and her multitude of pets.1 point lost for the ending which was unrelated to anything that happened in the film and just further ingrained the fact that the movie lacked any real story telling.Positives are that Margot Robbie was perfectly cast for the lead role, as well as Ryan Gosling as Ken (though another point lost here because I felt like his character wasn't utilised effectively).The real life facts throughout the film also served as nice little of trivia nuggets.","

",threenails10,20-Jul-23,"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.","

Barbie," Barbie-Verse begins,
",JapanMovies,10-Aug-23,"As I watched Barbie the Movie, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The vibrant pink color that permeated the film brought back memories of my childhood, when everything seemed so vibrant and full of life.What struck me most about the movie was that it wasn't a typical superhero genre movie, which is so common in today's movie industry. Instead, it was a live-action non-comic book movie that was a breath of fresh air.The movie sets were stunning, with wild and imaginative backgrounds that were so fun to see on a beach. The foreground was equally as enjoyable, with standees that added a touch of whimsy to the film.As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but feel like a kid again. The childhood thoughts and memories that flooded my mind made me feel like I was back in time, experiencing the joy and wonder of childhood all over again.Overall, Barbie the Movie was a pleasure to watch. The imagination and creativity that went into the scene and set construction were seamlessly free-flowing throughout the film.

The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'.

Barbie," Just good fun and a great soundtrack
",nikitacpv,02-Aug-23,"Even though I never played with Barbie myself, when word came out of a Barbie movie being released, I knew I had to watch it!.With Barbie being a worldwide icon, a cast like this movie and a soundtrack like that, I still had my doubts this was going to be any good. I went to the cinema with an open mind and in the back of my head with the idea that I knew this might not be it for me.Overall the movie is packed with some great humor and a beautiful underlying story about who Barbie really is. If you look at the cast you'll see that all the women that portray Barbie are also called Barbie, but this movie, as well as the dolls in real life show that a Barbie can be anything. Even though our main Barbie played by the magnificent Margot Robbie was the ''stereotypical Barbie'' and I did like some of the more versatile characters, I still think they could have done better than having one bigger Barbie and one in a wheelchair.I admit that 9 is a high rating but after leaving the movie theatre 24 hours later and stil stuck with the lyrics of Ryan Gosling singing ''I'm just Ken'', I can't help but to give a solid 9.Although this movie in any other context might be ''forgettable'', it is still a Barbie movie and it was just good fun. The humor was good, the cast was great and the soundtrack might be one of the strongest things about the movie. The outfits, especially worn by Margot Robbie were stunning.This movie is not going to be for everyone. It was very fake, theatrical and very ''Barbie (of course). I still loved every part of it even though I never played with Barbie or even seen any Barbie movie before this.","

Barbie," Pink Political Power is: Fun, Funny At Times, Deep, But Aggressively Weird
",rgkarim,21-Jul-23,"LIKES:The Setting:
-It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.The Plot's Originality:
-Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye
-Barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn't expecting.-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.The Acting:
-McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me
-Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.The Comedy At Times:
-The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-And Helen Mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.The Pace:
-It's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.The Music:
-By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.The Message:
-There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig's writing.-It's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.DISLIKES:The Fun Vibes Take a Detour:
-I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-Gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.Gerwig's Hyper Agenda
-I get this is who she is, but I've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.The Stupidity:
-The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.-Will Ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-Meanwhile, Ken's handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-That excessiveness again just doesn't work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.The Character Usage is odd:
-The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-They do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and I think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.The Story Is All Over The Place:
-My fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going
-Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I'm still trying to process.-Gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.The VERDICT:
Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig's better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.","

Barbie," Not all is peachy when things get preachy
",eddie_baggins,27-Jul-23,"It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks/months, with the Greta Gerwig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas, critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs.A talent-laden affair in front of the camera with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the charge as plastic icons Barbie and Ken respectively and also behind the camera with Gerwig teaming up with her real life partner Noah Baumbach to bring Matel's beloved creation to life, Barbie is far better than it has any right to be as we explore Barbie Land and the real world with our protagonists, in what amounts to a pink fever dream that recalls old school Tim Burton at its peak, Barbie is also a little too heavy handed in the way in which it hammers home its messaging, making the film one that doesn't always correctly balance its oddball charm with preachy messaging.A film that in many ways had become too big too fail with anticipation around the one half of Barbenheimer (with the weighty Oppenheimer no doubt benefiting hugely from the cross promotion) reaching fever pitch levels all over the globe, the adoration aimed at Gerwig's film right now feels like the type of over the top praise that will be reevaluated in coming months/years too something more grounded, with Gerwig and her team deserving of praise for creating such a colourful world and giving us something that doesn't just feel like a two hour long toy commercial but also going over the top in its empowerment messaging that feels like a message swung too far into the direction of all men are patriarchal menaces who aren't deserving of the women in their lives.At its best when it allows its stars a chance to play within the confines of a likeable fish out of water tale where Barbie and Ken roam the boardwalks of Venice Beach adorned in skin tight Lycra or where Gosling's MVP performance as Ken see's the horse obsessed and Matchbox 20 loving beach bound man child bring too life a range of hilarious situations and sentiments, Barbie gets bogged down when it turns its attention to preaching too the converted and fails to make the most of its ""human"" characters like America Ferrera's Gloria or Will Ferrell's unnecessary tickle loving Mattel CEO, forgoing its comedic charms to try and be something it might naturally have become anyway had it dialled back the politics and just decided to be the fun escapist entertainment it often utilises.When fun and adventure is at the forefront of Barbie's agenda, Gerwig's film is an undeniable delight and you'd be hard pressed to recall a more colorful and playful film when Barbie is in full flight but with all the hyperbole coming thick and fast right at this moment in time, it's hard not too consider Barbie's public sentiments being blown up out of proportion as the films misses are overlooked in favour of viewers preferring to watch this cultural touchstone with a pair of (pink) rose-tinted glasses.Final Say -There's fun to be had from Barbie and the commitment of its two leads is a sight to behold, as is the world which Gerwig brings to life but when Barbie forgoes the fun and playfulness it thrives in in favour of repetitive messaging, the film becomes more of a slog than an enjoyment.3 Mojo Dojo Casa House's out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

Barbie," Funny but toxic feminist tale that doesn't make sense
",JonathanWalford,24-Jul-23,"The movie has a very clever intro, a charming set-up filled with sight gags, and some hilarious lines (especially those spoken by the narrator - Helen Mirren).However, it's essentially about a town of marginalized and emasculated men (the Kens) and when they discover they are only disaffected props, they create a toxic patriarchy (although we never see how they do it). The Barbies then manipulate the Kens, using feminine wiles and playing dumb, to coerce the Kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submission.Adding to a magnum of plot holes, and an ending that takes WAY too long, is a weird 'Pinocchio' twist when Barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vagina.This film panders to a pseudo-feminist audience.

",julietteshinta,11-Aug-23,"Barbie made a strong start really. Loved the characters, loved the production design and love love the acting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling but then along the way something happened and the characters dev becomes confusing.Certain characters portraying Mattel exec were added in but in the end they don't really represent anything because their characters doesn't evolve.. and for me it feels to forced to put Mattel in there as a character because of course the would like to look like they are neutral or even a solution, to which we thought, was a problem. However since in the end they practically does not do anything then you are left with the question, do we really need to see the Mattel executives in here?It certainly feel like the script has been rewritten a few times thus the message becomes quite complicated, convoluted and confusing for general folks like me.

Barbie," Unfocused jumbled mess
",TheNamelessCzar,28-Jan-24,I thought this was going to be a movie about the Barbie doll. I thought it would be somewhat entertaining and funny. The beginning was actually brilliant with its ode to a previous classic film i will not name so as not to spoil it. And then everything fell apart. The movie gets lost in its own attempted message of feminism and gender equality. It doesn't make its point at all and becomes incoherent and scrambled. There was no message as the movie tries to make a statement but comes across heavy-handed and confused. I looked at my watch several times to see how much more of this poorly directed mumbo-jumbo I had to tolerate. Best Picture nominee? No way.,"

Barbie," Greta shows real power of woman in Barbie
",GusherPop,21-Jul-23,"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.","

Barbie," A very enjoyable film
",lisafordeay,22-Jul-23,"Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf). Directed by Greta Gerwig the film follows Barbie(Robbie) a sophisticated young doll who notices that she is slowly turning human so she goes to the real world to find her previous owner and to meet the CEO boss (Ferrell) to find out why she is malfunctioning.Will she go back to BarbieLand or stay in the real world. Overall I was very surprised by this film. The cinematography was very good if not artificial,the story reminded me of Elf meets The Lego Movie. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken. Also stars Rhea Pherlman from Matilda,Helen Mirren as the narrator who throws fourth wall jokes,singer Dua Lipa as a mermaid and John Cena as a merman. Its a very silly yet stupid film but it's definetly a good movie.","

Barbie," A much more emotional journey than I expected
",yeswestan,25-Aug-23,"Leading up to the day I went to see this movie, I avoided as much advertising as I could as to avoid spoilers and go in entirely blind. But that being said, I learned very late that Greta Gerwig was the director of this film, and therefore, was not prepared for the emotional journey I was about to be taken through.This movie was unique, creative, fun, and so special. The music was excellent, the cast was wonderful, the costumes were amazing, it was funny, and the choreography was fun.As for it's flaws, this movie did have some uneven pacing. I felt that some side plot stuff was unnecessary (namely, most of the Mattel chase). Sometimes it was just very confusing for the sake of making audience members existential, the ending felt abrupt, and there was little justice by the end of the movie (though perhaps this was more of a conscious choice on behalf of the filmmakers to convey the endless, feminist fight).I was happy to see how this film really explored the female experience. From growing up to objectification by men. I was shocked to see Ken claim to love Barbie, only to objectify and hurt her later on; it was truly reminiscent of many elements in real life. Overall the tone and look of this movie was very unique and I enjoyed it a lot.I didn't expect to cry during the fun, silly Barbie movie I had been so excited to see, but I'm glad it was as emotional as it was.","

Barbie," Not Kenough
",pete-murphy97,30-Jul-23,"Barbie is a thoughtful homage to an iconic toy brand that overturns the well known stereotype of the blonde, plastic ""bimbo"". It is also undeniably Mattel's punt at keeping Barbie relevant and commercially viable for the next generation.In one fell swoop a corporate, patriarchal brand tries to distance its own corporate image from Barbie ""herself"" whilst also politically sanitising their toy brand at the same time. It's a PR stunt through and through. They want Barbie to be about individuality and self-determination, and that's all well and good; but there's still a corporate brand behind the curtain, even despite the gags (Will Ferrell) alluding to that ironic hypocrisy, such as the groveling admission about ""one or two"" previous Mattel CEOs being women, amongst a long line of men.That aside, on its own merits as a film this was very preachy and very convoluted throughout, the crossover between the two ""worlds"" was a really cool idea that just needed more development and streamlining to land properly. Barbie was well cast (Margot Robbie), as was her playboy, Ken (Ryan Gosling) and the comic relief alter-Ken, Alan (Michael Cera). Many of the ingredients and characters for a good film were present, but the execution fell flat.Somewhere beneath the political hullabaloo the film contains a valid message about mutual respect between the genders and a lesson on self actualisation. But ultimately, the film forgot that Barbie and Ken could have had some *fun* whilst also making the points the film set out to make. Making many of the characters superficial Kens or Barbies made the palette a boring and grating one, even despite the points that were trying to be made about individuality. The film also often lacked the light touch needed to captivate young girls who actually play with Barbie dolls and who won't necessarily understand the high level commentary at play here. Even if a mum or elder sister explains it to them afterwards.","

Barbie," Genius! We need more movies like this one!
",fthkgdcc,23-Jul-23,"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating. The Godfather of whatever this movie's genre is....","

Barbie," Funny And Good Cast, But Not This ""Great"" Movie Everyone's Been Saying
",HuskerNation1,05-Aug-23,"I wasn't dying to see this, but I felt like I had to participate in the Barbenheimer phenomenon, and the trailer looked good, so I went. I went in with reasonably high expectations because the reviews were high and it has a good cast and crew behind it. I was slightly disappointed.I enjoy Robbie's acting, and I also like Will Ferrell (who doesn't), it's got some good chuckles, the screenplay is solid. The soundtrack is also pretty good.Now, what's bad about it? Well, I felt like a film like this would be a tad more realistic then it was. This felt like an animated film inside a live action film. I feel like there were some parts that were unnecessary.Well, it was pretty good.

Barbie," The audiience seemed to like it
",neil-476,26-Jul-23,"Everything is perfect in Barbieland. Every day is identikit pink perfection for all the Barbies, and also for the Kens as long as they're getting attention. Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.As a film, this is an enjoyable mess. It aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages, escapist silliness, wild fantasy, social satire with well-staged musical production numbers, in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdn't work together, but somehow do. It's bright, colourful, tuneful, quite funny, well played, sometimes thoughtful and thought-provoking, mikdly feminist (though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity) and, broadly, good-hearted. Helen Mirren's narration is dry and funny, and the last line is a killer.Looking at the film as a social phenomenon, I have two observations. One, a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist, and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie ABOUT DOLLS. This film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is, and it's certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is. Two the cinema was packed (two-thirds female) and the audience seemed to enjoy it. The only films I have seen filling cinemas in recent years have been aimed at female audiences. No comment!","

I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of ""manly"".

Barbie," Surprisingly Good
",TigerHeron,10-Aug-23,"I wasn't expecting much, but this movie is great! It's a smart comedy. The film is clearly feminist, but it is NOT ""preachy"" as some other reviewer complained. Yes, there is one speech, but it's not made by a Barbie. It fits into the story.The film mines the Barbie and Ken existence of ""life"" as a plastic doll for comedic effect, with some song and dance sequences as a bonus. But it's mainly about an existential crisis for the main Barbie (Margot Robbie), who travels to the ""Real World"" to resolve her crisis. Events in both the ""Real World"" and the Barbie world drive the plot, which concerns the collision between the ideal and the real. The dramatic conflict centers on the contradiction between the ideal world of the Barbies and the disappointing, yet also tempting, reality of our world--the Real World. I thought the last scene was perfect and perhaps slyly politically incorrect. You can judge for yourself. I only didn't like the music played over the end credits. The song and dance numbers in the film were entertaining though.","

Barbie," Relevant and forgettable at the same time
",Drawmort,15-Dec-23,"Yes, we have a socially relevant film, perhaps with topics already touched on in other works, but we must recognize that it was necessary to do it from the perspective, the seal and the criticism of and towards the figure of Barbie. The subjects touched on are explicitly verbalized in the film, it doesn't allow for such a deep analysis without being redundant with the message delivered.If we get into the technical fibers of the film, the script and the performance of Ryan Gosling is the highlight of the film. Unlike my fellow critics and cinephiles, I don't think Margot Robbie gave an awards-worthy performance. It's a good performance that meets the range that the script demands, but it's not particularly outstanding, as it was, for example, in Babylon.The direction work is conformist and the editing has a couple of visible errors. I'm not a fan of musicals, so in the end I ended up a little bored.Relevant film, to see once and look for something else.","

I think if it hadn't had Ryan Gosling in it, it would have been something of a snore fest which is ironic as it was aimed to be a female vehicle.I understand the premise of Barbie wanting to go to the real world in order to find a cure of becoming human. However, it's not a very well rounded tale. There's the odd amusing scene throughout until the Ken dance/song near the end, which ends up being hilarious and has added a good two stars to my review.It takes itself a little bit too seriously at times when really it could have done with a bit more humor.

The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised.

Barbie," Initially fun but there's lots to dislike
",SexyActorsJunkie,24-Jul-23,"I went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because, come on, who is more perfectly beautiful to portray Barbie than Margot Robbie? And who's more attractive to be Ken other than Ryan Gosling?This movie was too long, too wordy and too preachy to be for actual children. Which is odd since it's about the most iconic doll of all time.The creation of the Barbie world was awesome: sets and props. But the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didn't impress, and neither did the resolution of the story. How about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other? Some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble. Also, they didn't have to pointedly throw in that Barbie was drinking cow milk- cow on the label in all caps. Are the writers anti vegan? At least they mentioned in the film to the audience that Ken was wearing faux fur, but it was like a condescending little note because I guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows. Anyways, the best parts of this movie were: Ryan Gosling all the way (gorgeous, funny, singing and dancing,) the conflict between the two alpha Kens and introducing me to Simu Liu and Issa Rae. Despite its flaws, I'm glad I followed the hype and saw this movie. But I doubt I could sit through it again, it's just too silly and canned preachy.","

Barbie," The ""American Psycho"" of this generation.
",kanad004,03-Aug-23,"Barbie is one of those few films that are able to merge an extremely unreal and borderline bizarre environment with an immensely grounded and hyperreal take on society successfully, and still be massively entertaining.The script is one of the finest in the history of film and demands supreme attention of the audience, not just to the surface level occurrences and dialogues but also to the underlying subtext (paralleling American Psycho).Contrary to the general consensus, this is very much a coming-of-age movie through the eyes of a young girl. Barbie has an idealistic and perfect outlook towards life which gets crushed and she is forced to accept, then gradually embrace and finally manoeuvre through.The film is also vastly political in nature (not just gender but otherwise too), compelling the idealistic society to realise how fractured their own internal workings are resulting in them implementing real life political resolutions to their systems.There are so many more layers to peel off of the writing which elevates this movie from a straightforward comedy/satire to a film that deserves to be broken apart piece by piece and studied extensively for generations to come (sooo very similar to American Psycho).And finally, Ryan Gosling does indeed deliver the absolute most sublime performance of his career.","

Barbie," Fantastic Concept, Plastic Execution
",ian-47918,05-Aug-23,"Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023MILD spoilers ahead.""Barbie,"" directed by Greta Gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. A popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year's best films. Its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. Unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. Even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one's head after leaving the theater.From its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, Barbie's opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. The music is great, the narration pokes fun at the Barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. Margot Robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from Barbie. Accompanying her is the equally funny Ken, who is played by Ryan Gosling. The two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!Despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. Once Barbie and Ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. The picture's demographic is also confusing. What looked like a kids' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (For example, what a penis or a vagina means.) The sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.""Barbie"" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. It sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. It makes for a frustrating ending. The moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. Instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. It may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. It may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.How characters grow is another misstep from Gerwig. Many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. Barbie, Ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. It is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. If the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.Even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. Fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. The production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. The choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun Barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. It really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.Barbie - 65/100

A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though!

",mieriks,19-Jul-23,"This movie, about Barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!I liked the concept, and it reminded me of The Toy Story Quadrilogy (1995-2019). The dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. The sense of humor were present, and I noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. Its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. The attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. The characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. They acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, I think.I think the story was alright. The outer story in the first and third act was good. The beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of Barbie and how Barbie has affected people before, but also how Barbie should affect us in the right way today. It's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. The second act is a big part of a movie, and I got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. It had its meanings, but I think much of what happened, especially in Los Angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. It was much small-talk, and I sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. Anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.In conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. The attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. The movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. While the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. Nevertheless, the movie's exploration of Barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. Despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others.","

Barbie," This isn't the movie you think it is - and it's probably better for it.
",I_Ailurophile,27-Jul-23,"Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.And yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'Barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It's not inaccurate to say that 'Barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that's the worst that I can say about a picture, then I'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' from ""a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,"" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I'd never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.","

Barbie," [6.8] Great rosy start, mild yellow-gray continuation
",cjonesas,26-Sep-23,"A nice, childish movie deserving around 6 as the rating, but as I enjoyed it mildly and sometimes more than averagely it gets a nice and commendable 6.8 rounded up to 7.The star and highlight of the movie is of course Margot Robbie and if Ken, his male counterpart had the same charisma and aura it would have become so great.In fact the Barbies are very good generally, whereas the Ken s are not, bland, generic, sometimes cliche and only the main Ken shines because of his persona, but is dissolved in the treacherous script, screenplay and plots.The movie should have been all rosy , photography, cinematography and screenplay alike. Unfortunately, the plots and some gray acting ruined those , especially in the last 60-45 minutes to the very end.For once, a movie should have been all dolls and Barbie's existential crisis threw a tasteless blanket of gray flowers and artificiality onto their awesome world.Screenplay/storyline: 6

Barbie," Surprisingly Great!
",tfpdbbxck,25-Jul-23,"I went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it. When I exited the theatre I was shocked by how good of a film it was. I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more.

Barbie," 6 for trying - SOLID IDEAS HERE
",persian-belle,19-Oct-23,"I had moderate to slightly high expectations and that's what I got... well, maybe a little less.I'm no film expert or critique. As a woman, a teacher and a mom, I was happy that Mattel took this step toward addressing the ""stereotypical"" image of Barbie which is said to have impacted how young girls have judged themselves for many years.Throughout the recent years, you would see Barbies of various races, but (to my knowledge) always skinny, with pointy feet, fashionable (mostly rather revealing) clothes and a face full of make-up.So, yes, it remains a question to be answered, but this movie didn't seem like it covered it all.For example, the film starts with reminding us that pre-Barbie, little girls played with ""baby dolls"", not an adult, make-up wearing, fashionably-clothed Barbie.This question is never addressed in the film again.Even for teens and adults, this film seems like it has so many great ideas, but it doesn't know where it's going.Plotline seemed a bit convoluted to me.Lastly, I hope that making this movie was not an effort by Mattel to sell more Barbies.","

Barbie," Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
",lukell-96155,22-Jul-23,"This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... I don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that.","

Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud.

Barbie," If you want it, here it is. Come and get it.
",lee_eisenberg,03-Aug-23,"No doubt you've spent a few months hearing about Barbenheimer, referring to the simultaneous releases of Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Obviously the movies couldn't be more different. I saw ""Oppenheimer"" last weekend, as arms control experts had recommended seeing it before ""Barbie"" after all, she lives in the world that he helped bring about.Anyway, this movie addresses the issue of how we define gender roles, and of course looks at matriarchy versus patriarchy. The plot actually reminded me of the 2007 Disney flick ""Enchanted"", with the idea of an ultra-feminine character from an apparently perfect world suddenly coming to the real world.All in all, it's an over-the-top but enjoyable flick. You'll probably leave the theater asking yourself what it means to be a man or a woman. Along with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the cast includes America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Ncuti Gatwa, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren and Michael Cera. Therefore, the supporting cast makes this movie a link between ""Ugly Betty"", ""Kim's Convenience"", ""Sex Education"" (twice), ""Ghostbusters"", ""Anchorman"", ""Prime Suspect"" and ""Arrested Development"".","

Barbie," Not the evil propaganda some people are saying, but also not funny and very shallow
",Metal_Robots,22-Jul-23,"I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.The ""empowerment"" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid's film-level ""just be yourself and like yourself"" thinking that applies to any person, but it's only the girls in the film that make these profound ""revelations"" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the ""real"" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it's pretty shallow and light-weight and isn't going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is.","

Barbie," A JOLLY LIFE IN PINK IS GLITTERING & HEART-STIRRING
",devendralilke,21-Aug-23,"Greta's satire that evidently seems like a promotion run of Mattel's creations, is beyond the pink dazzle. The sugary-adorable pastels, mostly the pink colour spreads all over the dreamy world of Barbie. Everything that makes it fancy, fizzy and fantastic are the production designs and costumes. Ebullience is lightened by the sparkling musical sequences. The Fabulous Margot Robbie as Barbie is the eminence of this Greta's clever and creative vision. The Cast is typically perfect to saturate in the fantasy. Ryan Gosling charmingly lends a kenergy in the story. The ridiculous banters strives all the way, sometimes little silly but mostly unveils the story's themes. There's a brief mention of Mattel's creation & how they flawed at a place when they aimed to represent a powerful figure. There's a slight malfunction between the fantasy and real world that alters different ideologies to flourish in the fun and laughs. The ideologies shapes into leading an unresolved fragment of humankind. The two contrasting portraits, the Patriarchy & Feminism comes in a fairy tale that once again liberalise the women and evokes them to voice up for themselves and their dilemmas & demands for a treaty for their existence and admiration which is partly void in the flawed-society. The sweet messages are beneath the glaring pink world, that adds a soul in the story. Barbie's exploration in finding the answer to the malfunction leads to many errands along the way. She realises the elegance of tears, her purpose and worth, being imperfect is normal and ultimately the self-discovery immerses in the conclusion. A pink jest is a celebration of womanhood as the flashes of memories flow. Gradually it reaches to hearts of millions with its resembling storytelling. It turns into a tender-mellow tale of Barbie, growing up to understand the sentiments of a human much more. Indeed this elegantly crafted and insightfully written tale drives to a sentimental ending. The heart would be pink, the tears would be pink, hereby you'll love pink.","

Barbie," Plastic Perils: A Hollow Venture into Doll-Dom
",RomeoQQ,01-Oct-23,"""Barbie (2023)"" attempted to mold a modern narrative around the iconic doll, but what unraveled was a feature film that was as plastic and hollow as the toy it's inspired by. The film sets forth with a glittery promise of self-discovery and empowerment but stumbles and falls face-first into a puddle of clichés and superficiality.The protagonist's journey from a boxed perfection to a self-realized individual is filled with predictable plot twists and eye-roll-inducing dialogues. The script seems to be churned out from a factory of trite, lacking any originality or depth, much like the molded plastic of a Barbie doll.The animation, touted as one of the highlights, is nothing more than a barrage of pastel colors and unrealistic body proportions. It fails to breathe life into the characters or the world around them, making it a plastic paradise devoid of any genuine emotion or relatability.Supporting characters are as one-dimensional as they come, each embodying a blatant stereotype without any redeeming qualities. They flutter through the scenes, contributing nothing to the narrative other than filling the already cluttered screen.The attempt to modernize Barbie and make her relatable to the contemporary audience is a lost cause as the essence of what makes Barbie iconic is buried under a heap of modern-day jargon and misplaced attempts at humor.The villain, a caricature of societal expectations, is as menacing as a bubble wrap, failing to evoke any real threat or concern.Barbie is a missed opportunity to delve into the evolving identity and societal expectations of women. Instead, it serves a shallow, glitter-coated narrative that's as fleeting and forgettable as a fashion trend. In trying to find Barbie's place in the modern world, the film loses its way and ends up being a lackluster parade of plasticity.","

Barbie," Funny and entertaining but kind of a mess
",Imaculata,30-Jul-23,"The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.The Barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. But if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that ""it hates men"", then you completely missed the point. The movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques Barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. It pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against Barbie as a product. This is a Barbie movie after all. That this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. But the execution leaves more to be desired.There is plenty to critique about the Barbie movie that is valid. The Barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. The movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. Instead, it is all over the place.Just the plot of Barbie and Ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. But to the movie's credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a Barbie movie. I would argue, too much.There's the plot of Mattel trying to capture Barbie, with the awkwardness of a Mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing Mattel. It never feels entirely earnest.Then there's the plot of Barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. This plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.Then there's the side plot of Barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. The Barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. At first it seems as if Barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. Once Barbie and Ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. But then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. Such as Mattel having a mysterious floor where Barbie's deceased creator is still alive. This is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn't quite explain it either. The movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. It was a side plot we didn't need in the first place.Then there is the plot of Ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to Barbie-land. This plot feels a bit disjointed. It ends up dragging the third act back to Barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. Everything with Barbie trying to make the other Barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly Barbie, should have been cut. It feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.All in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. This script could have used a bit more editing. Also, it ends on a joke about Barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. When you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. Suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.As a comedy movie, you can't aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie's comedy is aiming for the lowest bar. It doesn't seem to work.","

Barbie," A funny film but with a spoon fed, preachy message and no real writing behind it
",billygonzalez-48596,22-Jul-23,"Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing ""lego movie"" and ""barbie goes to the real world"" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera's character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn't come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial.","

Barbie," In Awe
",colbiroy,24-Jul-23,"I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!","

Barbie," No questions just answers
",misscattik,07-Aug-23,"The title of the review practically sums it all up. With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.However, the opening scene is great (if you know the reference, of course), and there are some funny moments. But they seem to go against the general idea rather than to support it.",NA
Barbie," A mix of somewhat funny summer-movie and social commentary. But it's all over the place.
",Gelaos,20-Sep-23,"A commercial stretched into a full-length feature film.Barbieland, as an inversion of the real world with which it s mentally connected had a lot of potential. However, Barbie (both the doll and the film) is primarily a corporate product, and it's evident that the creators were not given freedom to explore the material in a more sophisticated way.The film explores several social issues (feminism, patriarchy, sexism, ...) in a way that may seem too preachy, in-your-face or even off-putting. I'd say that these topics are intentionally depicted with a child-like mindset and it may take a while to wrap our adult heads around such approach.Despite this, thanks to the vibrant cinematography, over-the-top social commentary, skillful direction, and great performances (Gosling as Ken rules), Barbie manages to entertain, albeit in a somewhat absurd way.Nevertheless, I expected more from it.","

Barbie," Really good . Like nothing I've seen before
",coraloughreyobrien,31-Jul-23,"I thought all the jokes were really funny and I felt a bit sorry for Ken while all the barbies rule barbie world all ken (Ryan gosling) wants is to be noticed by barbie (Margot Robbie) and when he goes to the real world and discovers that it's all about men and horses and he freaks out . I also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde . I also thought that it was really sweet the way barbie met Ruth and Ruth was kind off like a mother to her and she helped her along the way in the movie . Everything was pink I can see how there was a shortage of pink paint . And it was really funny when the narrator was giving her opinion throughout the movie . So to all the cast, directors , singers , producers and people involved well done . It was amazing. And it will give girls a lot off confidence for a long time .👏👏👏👏👏","

Barbie," What Walt's Watching
",waltermwilliams,20-Jul-23,"""Barbie"" the movie must be a dream come true for girls all over the world and some guys too if that's your jam.I know my daughter treasured her Barbie collection into adulthood and thought this was in her own words the ""Best Movie Ever""!The film opens with a brilliant parody to Stanley Kubrick's Sci-Fi Epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).Margot Robbie stars as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and believe me she ain't the only Barbie in this Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy with very adult themes
You will laugh out loud at the clever script from Director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach.Clearly they have done their research with every Barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.The only one missing is ""Trixie Mattel"", based on the Drag Queen of the same name.America Ferrera shines like a diamond as ""Gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical Barbie Land after Barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.As a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.Will Ferrell on the hand as the ""Mattel CEO"" didn't meet the brief.I think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this Fantasy Land where only Barbies, Kens and one Allan exist.While Ryan Gosling is the key ""Ken"" based on Sun Lovin' Malibu Ken (1979), Simu Liu (""Kim's Convenience"", ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"") is one of the many other Ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""Kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""Beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.Rhea Perlman (""Cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of Barbies since 1959.Watch out for: ""Weird Barbie"" (other Barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera as ""Allan"". He really does fit into Ken's clothes.Plus the Pink Barbie Corvette and Caravan are stuff you'll want to take home with you.What I loved: The plethora of Barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various Kens (don't forget John Cena as Merman Ken)
Listen for: Dame Helen Mirren's hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.The Production Design is so elaborate that you'll want to explore ""Barbie Land"" in more detail using the pause button when this Big Screen flick moves to BluRay and Streaming.The movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"".Unfortunately the Third Act lets down the movie.On the way to its denouement ""Barbie"" turns into ""Barbie the Musical""with more singing and dancing than ""La La Land"" in the ""Beach Off"".""Barbie"" she's everything. He's just Ken.If you're a Barbie Girl in a Barbie World then come on to see ""Barbie"". Wear your best pink outfit, let's go party!","

Barbie," Barbie: Review
",bradykitchen-33648,07-Aug-23,"Good movie not a great one.My hopes for this movie were not all that high and the little light of hope for me was the fact that Greta Gerwig would be in the directors chair but as I had suspected she was not given 100% control of the film. I guarantee that every single second of this film was signed off by Mattel and you can definitely tell in some spots where they were the final say.Overall the story is ok, the setup is absolutely horrendous but after that the story becomes better and more interesting. The theme of feminism is very obviously woven throughout and does a decent job of bringing some of the issues the women face to life.The greatest achievement is the production and costume design as Barbieland is a very immersive experience but where it falls short are the scenes in the real world which just don't compare.The acting was all around good and had a couple of standouts including Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera. The big surprise was honestly Margot Robbie's performance which was far from the best in the film. Not to say Margot was bad just surprising considering she is the lead.Overall Barbie is good and will definitely get some nods for production and costume design during award season. Greta Gerwig was already a rising star in Hollywood but after taking on a film of this magnitude her phone will be ringing off the hook.","

Barbie," Lack of Depth
",mateosilie,28-Aug-23,"Let's start with what I enjoyed. The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.","

Barbie," Absolutely powerful movie and changed my perspective on life
",mollyt-73422,16-Aug-23,"This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.Starting with Barbie land, it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy. While the Barbies are in control there Is a lack of violence between the Kens and the Barbies. The most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between Ryan Goslings Ken and Simu Liu's Ken. Although, the Kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like 'beach' which is a role reversal of the human world. Barbie's entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see Barbie spiral out of control.Side note: the whole concept of weird Barbie's house is amazing, the discontinued Barbie's and Ken's are hilarious especially when you realise their backstories.Then the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements. Under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful. Barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through. We also see Barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit. This is when Ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more. The sequences in the human world aren't as interesting as Barbie world but still keep you hooked in.Then going back to Barbie world we see Ken's patriarchy. Unlike the Barbie's matriarchy it is completely toxic. The Barbies are all maids and 'stupid' only ever caring for the Kens. And then the Kens actually start a war with eachother over the Barbies. However the Kens are actually stupid and clearly don't see what they want. Ryan Gosling's Ken then explains to Barbie that he didn't like how he was treated before and he doesn't like the world he's built for himself now, and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world. The Barbies still run everything but they give the Kens more opportunities (the Kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions). This is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote now.....Finally the ending where Barbie is taken away by Ruth is beautiful. This made me cry the most, watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar this year more than any other.","

Barbie," It's alright
",zoeyrea,27-Jul-23,"I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won't lie to you and say that it's really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn't a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a ""good movie"" with. Now I can't say that I wasn't entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women's issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an ""everyone movie"", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don't get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of ""Barbieland"". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they're toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn't want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to ""do anything to see it in theaters again"", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.","

",matthewreinink,12-Nov-23,"This movie is not completely worthless like I was expecting it to be when I saw the trailer. There are some good comedic bits in this movie, and the acting is fairly good. There is also a lot more substance to this film than I was expecting, this movie really is geared towards adults rather than kids.I appreciate the movie touching on some interesting topics. Like the impact that Barbie has had on body image, her impact on gender roles, and the unhealthy obsession with material items. It is certainly a bold move by the director, one that could have been executed better. At times the delivery of the messaging feels too clunky, including a Shakespearean monologue from America Ferrera. This is also a movie that doesn't seem to want to end. The final 15 minutes drag with an inefficient wrap up sequence.","

It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious.

There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different.

However, i was not disappointed in the film, and especially by the performance of Margot Robbie, who had already made a big splash with her quirky and entertaining Suicide Squad role. Ryan Gosling is fine as Ken, but I thought that another actor might have been a more appropriate choice, as Gosling is a fine dramatic actor, but is not really noted for satire or comedy.The director refrains from making the film too preachy for the majority of the movie, but sometimes lets the film bog down a bit during the transitions of Barbie Land throughout the film. None of the secondary characters were really too memorable. Other than that, the film is entertaining, and a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon at the movies.","

Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season.

So I was pretty surprised when the film finally came out and the feedback was glowingly positive for the most part. I don't think the film was as good as some people have made it out to be, but it was certainly a lot better than the concept had any right to be.The film is at its best when it is trying to be light-hearted and funny. There are some genuinely funny and clever jokes in this film. Simple stuff most of the time, but done in a way that actually made me laugh out loud. If the movie had kept this tone for the entire run time it could've been a true classic.But in the second half of the movie things change. It decides it needs to make a point and the movie gets weighed down and loses steam as it tries to do this, ultimately limping to the finish line.At it's best this film is very good.

Barbie," It swings, and it kinda hits. Kinda.
",drawlife,22-Jul-23,"BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children's toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu's Ken.Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie's character. There's one scene that tackles Barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you're in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you're there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.As a male, this film isn't made for me. I'm obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6/10.","

Barbie," Playful idea about the Barbie concept that gets lost in the messy story.
",movieman6-413-929510,23-Jul-23,"Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed, part written and produced by Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Little Women.In Barbieland, everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly. Yet Barbie (Margot Robbie) learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her. Because of this, she decides to travel to the real world, to find out what's going on.On this journey she is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), who secretly tried to go with her. Together they now try to figure out what's going on, but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbieland.Greta Gerwig, together with the photography director Rodrigo Prieto, knows how to convey the Barbie world well, making it seem as if you are in a life-sized doll's room as a viewer. They used beautiful film sets for this. Thus, the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbieland. Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all Barbies and Kens.When the story moves to the real world, it changes the movie a bit. For example, how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences. Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail, the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange.In a comical way, they also try to make fun of both gender roles. For example, Barbieland should represent the opposite of the real world. In Barbieland, Barbies and Kens can do anything, but Barbie is often above Ken. In the real world, men often seem to be above women. For example, they try to divide this role in the opposite way. For male viewers, who do not like these current feminism movements, this can make this film less.Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different Barbies and Kens, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other Barbies and Kens cast members. Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie, trying to discover what her life destinies really are. Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken, who tries to make Barbie notice him. In the real world, however, he learns that as Ken, he can also do other things without Barbie. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the toy company that makes the barbie doll. His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world, but they seem more like they're also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act. This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual. If they brought out the real world a little better, the movie could have been a little better.The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story 3, for example, where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully.","

Barbie," Full of Surprises
",anthonywltrs,21-Jul-23,"This movie, wow. Just wow. This was unlike anything I had expected going in to seeing Barbie earlier today. I figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between Barbie and Ken with it ending with them getting together, beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever afterBoy was I wrong. Holy moly, Barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking, at least to me it was deep and thought provoking. I mean seriously, this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie. Yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times. But the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following - self identity, discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life. It is ok to be imperfect, to be weird, kooky, dark, it's ok to not live up to anyone's expectations in life or those around you. Just be you and only you. Self love. Willing to accept change even if you dont like it. There's also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixIt's funny, heartwarming, filled with unexpected surprises and Im sure for all the hardcore Barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant movieMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did an exceptional job as Barbie and Ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time. Ryan Gosling as Ken especially is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie as you can tell he had fun in the role as Ken.","

Barbie," Somewhere there is a good story
",ianshumway,22-Jul-23,"For starters this movie was made by women for women. I was not the intended audience, which is fine. But I feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here, or there could have been one. That everyone could have really liked.The movie is well made; I could tell that the people who made the movie liked Barbie, and knew their stuff. And that bleed into the movie. It has a cool set, lot's of creative choices and has good actors. With some genuinely funny gags and jokes.The cons: Some movies are great pieces of art, where you can't nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say. The classic disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan Pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themes.Then there some films like Atlas Shrugged where you know exactly what it's trying to say from the get-go. This is one of the those films, except it doesn't just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another. This film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it up.I don't think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be. And it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical. And all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way. There was even this car chase scene in middle which I believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for Chevrolet.Also there were some very weird parts of the movie. Where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways. I'll just give one example and finish on that. At the end Barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have. But she is wrong, everything she listed weren't women problems they were people problems. That's life. I sorry but it's not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss. Go talk to Machiaveli. These are problems everyone has.Anyway that's my review. I hope it's balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is .","

",samyakrout-65994,24-Jan-24,The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat.,"

",RightOnDaddio,13-Jan-24,"There is so much to like about this movie.It's got Minnie Driver in it. She's been driving a path to my heart for, yikes, thirty years now.Josh Hutcherson is a villain. And a darn good one.He's likable, funny, stupid and despicable all at once and it is lovely to see.He takes full advantage of his role and the audience in full reaps the benefits.This movie has cinematic testosterone with a capital T squeezed right from the glorious 1980's and butt-kicking with a capital B.They pair together rather nicely as they often do.The kills are plenty and plenty creative.Director David Ayer doing what he always does best.And Jeremy Irons stepping in and classing up the joint.This is a most welcome original theatrical release for January.It's not a comic book movie or a Star Wars movie.It's not a reboot, sequel or prequel.It's Jason Statham doing Jason Statham things.And it is a blast to watch on the big screen.I also highly recommend another Beekeeper film, Ulee's Gold (1997) starring Peter Fonda. It too, is quite buzz worthy.","

",dave-1205,12-Jan-24,"The film's narrative hinges on outlandish scenarios and unbelievable action, often veering into unintentionally humorous territory due to its sheer absurdity of specific sequences.While films, even those with mature content, can offer immersive experiences, 'The Beekeeper' falls short. Its graphic elements ('18' UK, 'R' US) juxtaposed with its stretched plot create a tonal disconnect that alienates its intended audience, leaving viewers unable to suspend disbelief.While the film delivers the genre's requisite action sequences, the plot struggles to maintain credibility, often indulging in exaggerated scenarios that feel more amateurish than polishedStepping out of a well-crafted movie is like emerging from a captivating dream, your mind buzzing with the story's echoes.

",kmkevinn-64733,12-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate.","

The Beekeper," Beekeeper takes full action packed charged in starting a new franchise.
",cruise01,13-Jan-24,"4.5 out of 5 stars.The Beekeeper is a pretty good action thriller film that puts Jason Statham back in a action role and at what he does best. This might as well be his version of a John Wick franchise.The plot is following a beekeeper (Jason Statham) after the lady he has been helping dies after being scammed and stolen from everything. He decides to go on the hunt for those that are responsible. Which leads into something more than he expects.Awesome plot which he follows a certain set of guidelines until the system is broken is were he steps in and at full force to stop the threats. The action sequences are awesome. Jason Statham was great. The rest of cast ensemble is good too. David Ayers direction is full of fast paced and action that makes this film worth seeing on the big screen. Sure the dialogue can be a little repetitive with characters explaining a beekeeper and how they are meant to protect the hive which sure is explaining it to the audience of who this character is.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining action films from Jason Statham since the first Transporter films.","

The Beekeper," Great action, but they forgot to write a script
",nscoby93,16-Jan-24,"This will be quick... everything about this film is hilariously bad. The script is bad, the writing is bad, and the dialogue is bad. It was so bad that I couldn't help but feel it was parody of itself because of how serious they took this subject matter.The premise is so laughable in its stupidity. If it wasn't for Statham and the surprisingly amazing action sequences, choreography, and great sound effects, this film would've been a complete waste of time.Jason Statham plays the Beekeeper who is essentially Jason Bourne, John Wick, and Agent 47 levels of badass. Jason Statham, to his credit, makes this whole Beekeeper ""society"" work as he is a sort of agent outside the government that protects society. He is retired now but is forced out to write a wrong against someone who cared for him. At it's core this film is nothing more than a paint by numbers action revenge movie. Unfortunately, it does it all in the most horrendous of ways.Then, if the story wasn't already horrible enough, the ending left my friend and I laughing. It literally, and I am not exaggerating here, just ends the cut to credits is the most erupt ending I've seen in a movie. If this ending is supposed to be set up to a possible sequel, I say NO!This year is not starting so well, but it is only January. This is commonly the slow time when it comes to movie releases. So if you are desperate enough and I mean desperate then maybe you can garner some entertainment from The Beekeeper but expect nothing from the story or characters turn your brain off enjoy your popcorn, your beverage, and good action.IMDb: 3/10

The Beekeper," By the numbers revenge porn Statham movie
",siderite,30-Jan-24,"I am going to fail this film as being as close to predictable as humanly possible, and still bad. Statham is the new Chuck Norris. He beats everybody up, kills the wicked and stares down the worthy. He is always fast, but compared only to the really slow opponents he has to face. He is always smart, but only compared to the morons stacked up against him. But he's entertaining, unless the story sucks.And boy, does it suck here. Almost every idea put forth is ridiculous and then completely contradicted just a few minutes later. The editing is bad, there is no one even resembling having fun, except maybe Bobby Naderi. It's 100% by the numbers, a movie scam.The FBI characters are completely pointless. The Black female agent is there for quota purposes only, as she starts off as incompetent, rude and cocky and she continues to run things on the basis of her arrogance alone, thus invalidating the entire premise of the film! Or maybe justifying it, I don't know. Jeremy Irons looks the same for decades, I don't know how he does it, but in this film even his character is reluctantly doing his job, reduced from a powerful man to an acting puppet in bad situations. Minnie Driver is in this. She answers phones. That's all she does for like three scenes.Bottom line: Hollywood should have Beekeepers. The only interesting aspect of this movie is that its production seems to parallel almost exactly the plot of the film. Everything but the righteous ending.","

",leftbanker-1,01-Feb-24,"Some call this a John Wick rip-off, but it isn't any stupider or make any less sense than that absurd franchise of mindless killing. I just kept hearing the Itchy and Scratchy theme song throughout this kill-fest: they fight and bite, they fight and bite and fight. Fight, fight, fight, bite, bite, bite, The Beekeeper. And were all the people in this unit also bee helpers? What if one of them wanted to have an ant farm? Would that be OK?Seriously, how old should you be before you grow out of these ridiculous combat movies where one man takes on an army? 12? 13 tops. If there is no possibility of a bullet or even a fist striking the hero, then all of the action is devoid of tension. If there is no tension, just fast-forward to the end credits and save yourself a lot of time. The Equalizer, John Wick, and the films of Jason Statham are not entertainment fit for adults.There were some horrific performances and huge casting gaffs in this. Jeremy Irons simply cannot do an American accent. Period. He sounded like he had a speech impediment. The FBI woman was morbidly obese, yet wore a Harvard Track & Field t-shirt. Was that supposed to be ironic?The movie shows why no one should have a gun in their home. More folks die from their own hands than intruders.","

Director David Ayer & writer Kurt Wimmer are no novices to the B+ action genre.John Wick has been taking up all the lone-killing-machine real estate of recent years. Where Wick leans into assassin/fantasy, Beekeeper does well to stay relevant. Turning on internet scams, dirty money, sketchy government officials, & family ties, it lays an acceptably current foundation. No, it's no Pulitzer, but heavyweights Statham, Rashad, Irons, Driver, Hutcherson, et al, & a competent supporting cast hit the right dramatic beats along the way. There's room for slightly better characterisation but one appreciates that the set armourer has priority over the acting coach in the high body count genre.My minor quibble is with the ""jello"" effect video cinema cameras suffer from.

The Beekeper," 🐝 Like The Writers Just Took a Couple of Bee Concepts and Ran with it(and Never Followed Through on one of them Too) 🐝
",DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,12-Jan-24,"Just Got out of a The Beekeeper Screening.LOL yh............. Ok Where to Start. Look, I'm not going to be a downer on this Film. There were Multiple People Laughing throughout the Audience, so the Fun Factor was Definitely There.🐝/ 🌍 I Mean the Core Concept of the World of Bees that is used as a Juxtaposition against Humanity and It's Upper Echelon of Constructs was a Great Idea.Let's do the Positives First -1. 😠Or🎉Or🤡. The Tone of the Film. I Love this Tone . It's Basically Jason Statham is Dead Serious(Every Time he is around FBI, Security Guards or the Scam Workers it's Funny because he plays it Dead Seriously and Everything Around him is Pretty Much a Joke😂🤣), with Everyone Else Being 1 of 5 Things -1a. 🃏 Characters are either Flamboyant Caricatures (Hosts of the Scam, Australian Guy and his Crew and The Pink Jacket Beekeeper)
1b. 🎉 Or Have this Comedic/Jovial Tone About them (Workers of the Scam in this Corporate Building, The FBI couple, one of them whose Mother Just Died by the Way 🤦🏻😂)
1c. Or Cannon Fodder(Seals, Delta Force, Heavily Armed FBI Guys)
1d. 😠 Or Serious (2nd in command of FBI, The President)
1e. 💆 Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are doing some sort of Whimsical/Serious at Times Tone.2. 📜.....I think the Opening Works, and Many of the Ideas of the Film are Great. But where are the Thawing out and Details of Pretty much everything in this Film?3. 💣 The Action Scenes. Some of the Action Scenes were Ok and Others Were Great. Particularly -3a. FBI outside the Building Scene.3b. The Elevator Scene.3c. 🃏 The Pink Jacket Beekeeper Scene. (LOL it was just outta nowhere and Ridiculous yet Entertaining)3d. 🔪 The One on One Fight Scene near the End. WHAT A SCENE! IT GOT PRETTY INTENSE. Multiple Oooooossss from the Audience I was with.On to the Negatives -1a. 📜 Did they Rush the Script or Something? Again the Core Concept of the Bees ""Keeping Things in Check"" is a Great idea. Where's the Fleshing out of this and Everything Else?1b. 🐝 So the Beekeepers are So Deadly Right? So Deadly, that the Beekeepers make the Delta Force and the Navy Seals look like Wimps right? So why does Jason Statham Dispatch of a Flamboyantly Dressed Eccentric Beekeeper 🐝 with Not Too Much Effort? I mean, she didn't last that long, at all. Some of the Navy Seals put up more of a Fight than her(Not really, but you get what I mean)1c. 🐝 The Queen Bee Concept. So when the Queen Bee becomes Less Productive or Sick, the Worker Bees Kill her right? So why did the Filmakers Abandon this right at the Very end when Jason Statham is Staring at the Queen? Hello! He's called the Beekeeper and he doesn't even Follow through on the Concept? Ok so the Writers had no Balls to pull off the Kill? What about the Writers at Least Playing on this Angle At the Very End far more? Have Jason Statham take hold of that Revolver and having the Son and Queen There Playing Russian Roulette with the Revolver or Something. But I get that they decided to go with ""Well, the Beekeeper Killed the Defective Offspring"" I guess.1d. 🐝 You're Telling me that the Queen Bee didn't know where all that Money 💰 was Coming from?🤷 Neutral Note - Why is Jason Statham Actually Handling Bees? Is this part of the Beekeeper Training Regiment? Or Just a Schtick that's part of the Film? Ok that's fine, I have no Real Problem with that.Overall, with all that Said LOL. Was I Entertained?........Yes, I was.","

",mertafor,01-Feb-24,"There are ""feel good"" movies. You just watch them to put a smile on your face, they make you feel happy. And then, there are movies just make you feel bad. You feel bad because your intelligence rejects such an inferior product. This is a recent trend actually. I seriously don't know how they pick these actors and writers but they deliver the worst material thanks to horrible writing and cringy people. By the way, I'm an action fan and ""mindless action"" is great most of the time as long as it's done right. This is just a John Wick wannabe B movie diguised as an A class thanks to its budget (probably above the average).There is not much to say about Statham, he's doing some of his usual stuff again except he can't bend, jump or do his moves on the floor due to his age. As for the rest of the crew, that FBI lady is in the center of ""feel bad"". I mean useless nosey female law person is a cliche older than me already but her appearance, attitude and style couldn't be cringier than this, zero credibility. At least try to find some actor looks like a government agent for god sake. Her only contribution to the story is to help bringing more people to get wasted by Statham. As for Jeremy Irons, clearly he needed money, maybe that's understable at some extent. I won't even go into other cartoonish villains. Very bad copies of John Wick universe characters.Long story short just stay away from this one. This is not John Wick, Nobody or even Extraction.","

The Beekeper," I'm honestly disappointed to say I didn't like it
",Neptune165,02-Feb-24,"In the latest Jason Statham venture, 'The Beekeeper,' the film takes an audacious swing at action but ends up missing the mark by a wide margin. The acting is staggeringly subpar, setting Statham on an unintended pedestal that makes him seem Oscar-worthy by comparison. It's as if the casting was deliberately skewed to elevate his performance through the mere juxtaposition of talent-or the lack thereof. The action sequences limp along without the slightest hint of vigor or excitement, the anticipated gore is conspicuously absent, leaving much to be desired for fans of the genre. The punches, both literal and metaphorical, lack any semblance of impact, making each fight scene feel more like a choreographed middle -school dance than a battle. To add insult to injury, the dialogue is so laughably inept that it unwittingly becomes the only source of entertainment, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Leaving audiences wondering what could have been if it had managed to harness even a fraction of its star's renowned kinetic energy.","

It reminds me of films like The Transporter and Crank but in fairness comparing The Bee Keeper to the others The Bee Keeper takes itself a little more seriously with a plot of standing up for the underdog ageist big business that makes the path of revenge this movie goes down even sweeter.Statham takes his homage of the 80s action hero to a new level of invincibility that would humble Dominic Toretto. I mean some of the action sequences were just wild from beginning to end, but I ate it up!Statham is serving up the best man meal i had for a while and its as sweet as Honey!","

That said: suspension of disbelief is quite important with this one.I do believe that John Wick is the better movie (franchise), but it's not like there can only be one. There is also a sense that the movie has a bigger universe ... if this is successful I do believe that we can and will see a lot more of Statham and others. Just saying - be aware what this is and what you want to watch. It is nice to see something from David Ayer ... he serves us something quite violent!

The Beekeper," For how long these bad movies patch
",rehmankhilji,04-Feb-24,"Upon encountering the name David Ayer as the director, alongside Jason Statham in a production bearing a promising title, I anticipated a satisfying full on action movie experience. However, akin to the recurrent pattern observed in Statham's previous films, this one, albeit marginally superior, failed to meet expectations.Initially, the director presents a character engaged in beekeeping, yet the portrayal lacks authenticity by sparing only a meager 100 bees and possessing a minimal number of hives, if not fewer than a dozen.The film's execution is notably deficient across numerous scenes, prompting a sense of incredulity and frustration. Numerous lapses in coherence and logic pervade the narrative, leaving the viewer bewildered and questioning the purpose of the cinematic endeavor.The prevalence of clumsy mistakes becomes evident within the initial minutes, rendering the movie entirely nonsensical in its unfolding. Emmy Raver-Lampman's casting in a particular role remains questionable, lacking a discernible rationale.In summation, refraining from viewing this production does not entail a significant loss, as it fails to deliver any substantial content of note.","

It's a Jason Statham action movie and does not deviate from the pattern. Heck, it's a lesser John Wick. And yet, yeah... the action is good. It's a mindless popcorn flick that escalates quickly, and some will love it for that, however, I see it maybe only being fun after having a few drinks and putting it on with a group of friends - it's pretty silly and very undemanding of its audience.

The Beekeper," A silly anti-scammer revenge fantasy
",academic-drifter,16-Jan-24,"The origin of this revenge fantasy isn't hard to imagine. My guess is that the writer (whose track record in recent years consists largely of writing scripts for completely unnecessary remakes of great action films) was persuaded to give money to a Nigerian prince or invest in NFTs, and decided to get payback by making them the villains of an action piece. Only having Jason Statham beat up a bunch of crypto bros seemed like an unequal contest, so he needed to up the stakes - with extreme prejudice.Thus we get a film in which a bunch of suspiciously well-organized scammers clean a sweet old lady (played by Mrs. Huxtable herself, so you know she's pure goodness) out of her life's savings. Unbeknownst to them, she rents out her barn to a beekeeper who decides to take revenge. Only he's not just a beekeeper, but a retired ""Beekeeper"", a former member of an ultra-secret elite extralegal organization created to maintain ""balance in the system"" by any means necessary, provided those means are violent ones. What could possibly be wrong with that?And with one phone call to his former employer, ex-Beekeeper Statham (his character has some typically generic name that is utterly unmemorable) gets needed information that federal law enforcement has been unable to obtain for years. And with it he begins to work his way up the chain to the very top, brushing aside with casual indifference challenges that would stymie anyone else. Armed thugs, SWAT teams, and ex-Special Forces operative are shrugged off with just a few moves. Injuries that would immobilize or even kill lesser people are mere annoyances to him, handled with a grunt and an application of a piece of cloth to some random part of his body. T-800s would envy such durability.More concerning is the recurring condition from which Beekeeper Statham has suffered that has caused him to internalize both his title and his pastime, to the point where every conversation with him degenerates into a series of beekeeping metaphors. Evidently this is a viral illness, as others he comes into contact with or who even learn of his existence soon spout the same inane analogies. With it comes a sort of resigned acceptance that all this murder and property destruction is necessary to protect ""the hive."" At this point Mrs. Huxtable has been forgotten five crimes scenes ago save by her daughter, who happens to be an FBI agent and who manages to figure out everything with the help of a beekeeping manual. Yes, it's like that.To be fair, if you like this sort of thing it's not the worst movie in the world. The ""system"" is saved, bad guys get their just desserts, and Beekeeper Statham lives to beekeep in the sequel (if any of this constitutes a spoiler to you, welcome to action films). The greatest crime on display in it, though, isn't the scamming or the murder or the property destruction, but the utter waste of acting talent, as several award-winning thespians are asked to do little more than deliver their lines on the way to cashing their checks. The only one who really threatens to run away with the movie is Josh Hutcherson, who plays a classier version of Donald Trump Junior with a degree of panache that threatens to make the movie fun. But then David Ayer's questionable camera angles and his need to showcase Statham's evident case of facial paralysis intervene to ensure that he does not prove to be the true hero of the movie by saving it from the tedium of predictability. But hey, at least scammers will think twice about scamming lest a Beekeeper gets them, right?","

Not that he likes hornets, he's Adam Clay, an actual beekeeper. When online scammers clean out the accounts of a friend of his she commits suicide. Intent on revenge Clay sets out to hunt down those responsible, turns out he's a retired member of a super secret Elite group of assassins named The Beekeepers who operate outside of the Intelligence Community chain of command. Naturally he leaves mayhem in his wake but there's a conspiracy here which has a long reach and connections to the highest echelons of power. Some great hand to hand combat scenes, he takes on crooks, mercenaries and cops/feds by the score. The most unbelievable scene though is when another Beekeeper comes after him, won't reveal the details but nobody could be that crazy! While Clay is happy to shoot, strangle, stab, mutilate and burn alive the scammers and their goons he merely injures the cops/feds, a bit like Arnie in T2 kneecapping the cops. It is a very violent film though and the results are not hidden, lots of gore and corpses. Jeremy Irons dials in a performance as an Ex CIA Director.

",Br4ve-trave1or,31-Jan-24,"I've always wondered why no one wrote a 'John Wick' type franchise for Stratham and this movie could be it. Comparing it to John Wicks first introduction, I'd say I was insanely more captivated throughout this WHOLE movie. Simple plot BUT with a great concept. It seems in the beginning its just going to be a fun revenge film and it was, but not simplisticly so.The Hive can be explored even further with a sequel and more if Hollywood is smart. I don't believe any studio has lost money with Strathem at the helm and his last franchise movies were so long ago. And personally, I prefer old hard men in these roles Ala Keanue Reeves.","

I was able to articulate the entire plot to my wife before walking into the theater. Basically this one man goes through two branches of the federal law enforcement agencies without getting even a scratch. All law enforcement agencies behave like the keystone cops. Zero efforts were taken to write the smallest amount of realism into this script. I strongly believe Jeromy Irons can actually be scene laughing to him self during some of his ""serious scenes"" because he's going to fire his agent while at the same time thinking to himself ""I've done Shakespeare!"" The only positive aspects are the legitimate phishing scam used at the beginning (not the software) and the fight choreography which can be seen done much better in any of the John Wick films. I made sure to throw away my ticket stub to avoid any reminders or evidence I've seen this film. It's physically impossible to provide spoilers to this movie because there Was no plot.","

The plot and acting is appalling, with the main emphasis on killing as many people as possible in a John Wick 3, type of movie. Having Potus as the head of the large criminal organisation The Beekeeper is trying to eradicate, has to be from someone with little respect of the real world or common sense and then, top it off, having the 20 year old son of Potus be the mastermind behind his mother's empire is mind boggling.

",isaacsundaralingam,19-Jan-24,"David Ayer's 'The Beekeeper' might be good enough to make a convincingly fun trailer, but this Statham led action flick ends up being nothing more than a poorly written John Wick wannabe.Here we have Jason Statham playing Jason Statham as a beekeeper - an actual beekeeper but also a retired special agent part of an underground government program called (you guessed it) The Beekeepers. When his elderly neighbor, whom Statham repeatedly reminds us to be ""the only person who ever took care of (him)"", kills herself after losing her life savings in a phishing scam, he seeks revenge on her behalf, killing his way up the ladder of scammers towards whoever was responsible.'The Beekeeper' is written to be a very John Wick-esque action movie, with similar tropes and motivations, but with none of the smarts and the compelling that made the Wick movies so great. We have some bland characters spewing a bunch of off-the-script exposition at every opportunity, an underground system that's entirely uninteresting, some annoyingly corny bee trivia and worst of all, not a single satisfactory revenge moment. It's a revenge movie but the whole movie is just a repeated ""Wait, is that it?""... EVERY SINGLE REVENGE SCENE... ""Wait, is that it?""The action scenes were passable, sure, and the movie is definitely not boring, but at the end of the day, it's not worth your time. You might be inclined to say that it's just a mindless action movie and that I'm being a bit too harsh, and sure, maybe, but should I really not expect even the tiniest amount of logic and creativity in a movie that I'm supposed to be entertained by?","

The Beekeper," A Stinging Disappointment
",akcenat,31-Jan-24,"This 2024 action thriller aims high but fails to deliver. While Jason Statham is reliably gritty as ex-operative Adam Clay turned beekeeper, seeking vengeance for his neighbour's suicide, the silly script undermines any gravitas. Overwrought bee metaphors like ""time to smoke out the hornets"" make the premise absurd. Most supporting actors flounder, particularly the miscast female FBI agent (Emmy Raver-Lampman), who is, by the way, a terrible actress. The first half builds narrative momentum around Clay's crusade against predatory scammers, but the stakes needed raising, not contradicting. Once Clay infiltrates the corporation behind the phone schemes, the film descends into generic action movie tropes we've seen done better. Statham's action sequences still pack a punch but can't save the nonsensical plot. Even at a brisk 105 minutes, The Beekeeper starts strongly before losing its narrative sting. This would-be franchise-launcher leaves a bad taste. Not recommended.Rating: 5 out of 10 IMDb stars.","

",fallyhag,10-Feb-24,"I went into this film, knowing the actor and knowing what he typically does. All my predictions were correct, this was a lazy story with average CGI and amateur acting.I try to reason with myself explaining that this is a brain switch off film and I should just enjoy the entertainment. However, the story is so painfully bad that I just keep screaming all the way along as it progresses to a ridiculously stupid and nonsensical ending.I did like that the film was addressing the theme of the scammers on the Internet, but was disappointed to see that it glorified the call centres, making them high-tech, exciting and energy driven, rather than the dirty poverty rubbish centres run by desperate people.The action was cliche, and the CGI was absolutely awful in some places. The violence was as expected, and Jason Statham did what he always does, together with his ridiculous voice. Don't get me wrong I like him as an actor, but this was just a very lazy pay cheque.The climax was so poor you literally have to switch your brain off and forget who and where he is going to because if you start to think too much about the details, you will just simply switch off the television and go and paint the garden fence. And don't get me started on the cliche villain who came out of nowhere at the end to help create the bad ass fight scene which wasn't really needed.If you like a lazy film with little to no thinking required, then this one is for you. It will no doubt do well in the box office, then it will join the Z list of ridiculous movies on the bottom shelf.Not recommended. Because it was so lazy!","

Lets ignore that its an Australian movie, but considering some of the cast, the money on offer must have been good and included a free holiday on the Gold Coast.Storyline is about as original as a loaf of bread, the script lines were obviously limited to a small number of letters because it lacked a quality barely above a kids show, and the guys Statham had to fight were nothing more than statues awaiting to be hit.If you're a Statham worshipper, bored or low in IQ, its watchable, but be aware, you were warned.","

He'll stop at nothing to deliver raw justice to those who have it coming to them!I found the film to be ace! You just know within the first 15-20 minutes that The Beekeeper, AKA Jason Statham will deliver the goods as soon those responsible cross the line! The story-line is pretty good & straight forward! While it's not 100% unique, who cares! It's a simple story line with plenty of badarse action, explosions & fights to get you through the 1 hour & 40 minute (100 minute) runtime with some fast, high octane action!Jason Statham does it again in this film as he kicks arse & gets the job done! The other characters are pretty good & play their parts really well too! There's also some familiar faces as well so that's also a plus! I honestly, can't think of anything much negative to say about this flick, it's ace & probably one of the best action films I've seen in a long while!Overall, you won't be disappointed by this one, it exceeded my expectations & delivered so it did!

There are a few surprises which keep the viewer intrigued. Jason Statham is in a typical role, which he pulls off in his quiet way. There are fewer killings than the John Wick movies. If you like violent movies, this has got it. Here his skills are unrealistic, but the plot develops that sufficiently. The twists and turns keep it interesting and entertain. The movie does teach about beekeeping, so you may learn a few things. And, the bigger social issue here of taking advantage of people deserves a public conversation.

For starter the plot is actually much more developed, Beekeeper actually means more than simply some hero's nickname.Of course a Statham film you expect a lot of awesome fight scenes and they deliver. It is like John Wick except with kicks, punches, and is actually good. I think it is especially enjoyable when the villain are a bunch of call center scam artists.The final revelation was also extremely satisfying, watching the Beekeeper enacting justice on Hunter Bid... err... I mean... Derek Danforth. I thought the mockery of the office of the president was also clever. She is a combination of Biden (awful son), Hillary (woman president), and Trump (business tycoon).

",lex131,30-Jan-24,"I'm sorry for this great actor that better projects are not coming his way.This movie is just lazy bad. Bad scripting, bad camera, bad dialog, bad actors, bad everything. Even the fights were lazy bad. Even the one liners are bad.I liked ""Safe"" from Jason Statham and many other movies, this one doesn't even come close.Save yourself the trouble, watch paint dry. There's a lot more logic and entertainment in that.I'm so glad my wife stopped me from paying cinema tickets for this and instead I waited for it to appear online, then I would've really been mean on this review.I really hope he gets better scripts before he gets too old because I really like Jason Statham and his style of action.","

The Beekeper," Classic Jason Statham
",alwinsup,02-Feb-24,"A good none brain thinking action movie. Plenty of things happen during the movie. Good amount of action, story line, acting, build-up time, etc, etc.Jason Statham, as always, delivers his A-performance. At first I was doubtfull; will it not be a movie that is put togheter in less then 4 weeks? However it has a decent quality. People clearly thought about the story line before shooting it. The extra deepness of the story arround the ''bee-keepers'' instead of just acting the average middle class guy gave it a nice extra touch.Just buy your snacks and drink and relax a bit! You will have a good easy time!","

The Beekeper," The Stathe strikes again! Frequently.
",neil-476,25-Jan-24,"When online scammers strip Eloise of every penny, leading to her suicide, her beekeeper friend Clay determines that there needs to be some accountability.You know what you're getting with a Jason Statham film - it does what it says on the tin. And the action subgenre ""You shouldn't have messed with someone who has a friend/family member with a very particular set of skills"" is always enormously satisfying when well handled.And it is well handled here, both the hand-to-hand stuff, and the broader set pieces.The scammers in this case aren't based in Mumbai but are much closer to home, and there are some fun plot twists. The supporting cast are good (Josh Hutcherson is very effective as the chief (or is he?) baddie).This is a satisfying action thriller, with an ending which is about 5 minutes too abrupt - there are several characters/threads which deserved a bit more wrap-up.","

The Beekeper," Unbeelievably good
",judealexharnett,03-Feb-24,"As unbeelievable as it sounds this movie wasn't as bad as i expected it to bee. I expected just another bee grade action movie but it pretty much delivered an all fronts. Jason Statham was a pretty cool John wick, equaliser type of main character. And I must say as hard as it is to beelieve josh Hutcherson was really good as a villian.The plot wasn't the best, pretty basic and nothing new or inventive but for the most part the action scenes were done really well. The script was kind off silly. The amount of bee puns and analogies started beeing really annoying at some point though. A good way to kill time tho. 7/10.","

The Beekeper," This is what ACTION is all about !
",toonarly,31-Jan-24,"After the bricklayer, and the painter, now we have the beekeeper. Jason Statham definitely is the action star, his choreography and attention to story and detail is awesome in his latest action entree. Non stop action as he does justice on a massive hacker conglomerate that tricks innocent people out of their life savings (this is actually a true activity going on today) he is unstoppable and the fight scenes are amazing, keeps you glued to the screen the whole time. Sets up for a sequel as well. Like the bricklayer and the painter he's just an average Joe living a peaceful life as a beekeeper until he's driven out of ""retirement"" by forces unseen who destroy his benefactor and friend in a viscous data hack and causes them to commit suicide. There are a few people out there in todays world that do go after these despicable groups who do this heinous hack crime and kudos to all of them. This is taking it to the next level, makes me wonder if the current administration did the same thing to get elected, who knows. Most enjoyable fun I've seen in years. Nothing questionable, no nudity, lots of foul language and intense violence and gore. Not for the squeamish or young kids for sure. Enjoy!","

The Beekeper," Jason Statham Stings Back in ""The Beekeeper""
",PedroReviews,03-Feb-24,"Jason Statham returns to the screen in ""The Beekeeper"" (2024), wielding his fists and signature stoicism with gritty aplomb. While the plot might be as familiar as your worn-out leather jacket, the action sequences pack a punch that'll leave you buzzing with adrenaline.Statham embodies Clay, a beekeeper with a past as an elite operative known as ""The Beekeeper."" When his kindhearted landlady becomes the victim of a phishing scam, Clay unleashes his particular brand of revenge, his sting sharp and unforgiving. Think Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills with a beehive beard and a penchant for blunt instruments.The plot unfolds like a well-worn action movie map. You've got the wronged protagonist, the ruthless villain (played with deliciously evil glee by Stanley Tucci), and a trail of bodies leading to a showdown. But hey, sometimes comfort food just hits the spot, and ""The Beekeeper"" serves up a satisfying helping of vengeance with a side of well-choreographed fight scenes.Now, let's talk action. Statham does what he does best: dispatching bad guys with balletic brutality. Bullets whiz past him like angry bumblebees, but Clay remains miraculously unscathed. It's a bit like watching Neo dodge bullets in ""The Matrix,"" but somehow grounded in the grimy reality of this film's world. It's over-the-top, sure, but hey, that's part of the fun, right?What ""The Beekeeper"" lacks in narrative originality, it makes up for in its timely context. The film touches on themes of online scams and the vulnerability of everyday people, adding a layer of relevance that resonates in today's digital age. It's not exactly groundbreaking social commentary, but it gives the action a touch of weight beyond pure entertainment.So, is ""The Beekeeper"" a masterpiece of cinema? No, but it's a perfectly enjoyable action flick that delivers exactly what you expect from a Jason Statham movie: bone-crunching action, a sprinkle of dark humor, and a plot that, while predictable, doesn't get in the way of the punches and bullets. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush and a reminder that Statham can still kick some serious butt, then ""The Beekeeper"" might just sting you in the right way. Just remember, don't try any of his moves at home...or maybe just don't get involved in phishing scams.","

The Beekeper," Pretty good action movie, but....
",ryanwgordon,03-Feb-24,"I have watched a lot of bad movies these days. I may be on the minority, but I actually even thought John Wick 4 was overrated. The bullet proof jackets were a bit of overkill. Expendables 4 was so bad, that I can barely remember what happened in most of the movie. But this one I actually enjoyed. Could the writing have been a lot better, sure. But I didn't put this movie on hoping for an Oscar award winning movie. My only gripe is that the ending was a bit anti climatic for me. They could have written it a bit better. Overall, I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again with my wife if she can stay awake long enough for it.","

The villains here are so annoyingly smug you'll be waiting for Statham to get at them. Josh Hutcherson plays his role pretty well, acting like he is high part of the time, and Jeremy Irons is also good, although very little is done with him. My only complaint is that it ends in a typical Jason Statham way, kind of leaving it open for a sequel, maybe I was hoping for something different. But stil an entertaining action thriller.","

The Beekeper," Another win for Statham
",cassidyblay,01-Feb-24,"Just caught this movie and I've got to say, I really enjoyed it. The film is a straight shot of adrenaline, packed with the kind of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Statham, as always, delivers a powerhouse performance, embodying the role with the intensity and charisma we've come to expect from him.However, the movie wasn't without its flaws. The supporting cast left something to be desired. Their performances felt a bit superficial, lacking the depth needed to make the characters truly believable. There was one character in particular, whose reaction to her mother's death (a central plot point) felt off-more excited than devastated, which felt jarring given the context.Despite this, the film had its high points. The humor injected through some of the characters was a welcome relief, balancing out the tension with well-timed laughs. In summary, ""The Beekeeper"" nails it as an action-packed ride, thanks to Statham and the comedic moments, even if it stumbles a bit with its supporting cast.","

The Beekeper," Unlistenable Audio -- ZERO STARS
",nincubura,05-Feb-24,"This appeared to be the usual viligante movie by Jason Stratham, which are usually above average; and which reliably deliver at least somewhat plausible action... Unfortunately, the audio engineering was so poor that the movie was unintelligible -- without a studio quality audio compressor.It seems that the current generation of audio engineers has damaged their hearing with excessively loud music -- to the extent that they have disabled their capacity to effectively engineer audio which properly utilizes the additional dynamic range made available by modern technology.For the rest of you... the objective of greater dynamic range is not to make whspering inaudibly quiet, and explosions make your ears ring. The objective is to expand the range downward, along with the additional reduction of the noise floor. I.e., if you drop the signal to noice ratio from -60dB to -100dB, that allows an increase of dynamic range by 40dB. Specifically, the ability to hear all the audio subtlety and nuance that was previously LOST IN THE NOISE. Instead, contemporary audio engineers merely dispose of that nuance and subtlety, and reduce the speaking level -- to make room for louder explosions.Imagine the same situation for the video presentation, on a screen that could deliver the brightness of the sun (1 Billion NITS). Does that mean the cinematographer should cause the screen to deliver to your eyes, the full level of looking into the sun? (unless of course the objective is to show the sun and make you cover your eyes).Since I couldn't hear Stratham's whistering, under all the overemphasized explosions, gunshots, crashes etc... There really was no point watching the movie after about 22 minutes.An unlistenable movie gets ZERO STARS.SHAME ON AMAZON for creating junk like this, to foster PRIME media dis-service.","

",coastdaze,13-Jan-24,"It's a shame that action movies don't have a category of their own. Statham never disappoints me. I think this is one of his best movies, but I generally like them all. I am a woman and I don't know any other woman who likes action movies like I do, unfortunately. The Beekeeper is a 2 hour romp into that genre of movie that makes me hope there are men like this in the world. Beekeeper flows well, the action is top notch and fun, maybe a little shocking at times. Well-written screenplay. Nice photography, too. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Sure, some may say Statham always plays the same type of character...why not, he's great at it. And his co-star, Raver-Lampman, wow. I like this gal and I don't remember seeing her in a movie before. I feel the same about Naderi. I'd sure like to see another great script in B2. I don't think the Beekeeper/Agent Parker justice storyline is done yet. Oh, and it was so good to see Rashad again, it's been too long. Jeremy Irons, too. Fun ride.","

The Beekeper," No classic but still highly watchable
",trevorwomble,29-Jan-24,"This is actually one of Statham's better films of the last few years. An original story about a mysterious agent seeking revenge on the despicable con men who indirectly caused the death of his friend and neighbor starts a chain of events that spiral out of control.This is pretty standard stuff for Statham but it's very well directed by David Ayer and has a good solid cast. Statham was never particularly good at accents but at least his weird hybrid is explained in the story. However as expected he excels at the well filmed action sequences, and although there is a certain preposterousnesd that someone as distinctive looking as him can somehow keep evading capture without a disguise, his coolness in a gunfight is part of his charm. It's just the Stath doing what he does best, beating people up who step in the way of his retribution for an evil act.There's blood, gore and violence as well as bad language (although he rarely swears here) and the film is a great popcorn movie providing you don't mind that sort of thing. Statham may not be the worlds greatest actor but he's not terrible either. He knows what he's doing in films like this and does it very well, especially with a solid director like Ayer behind the camera.","

The Beekeper," Really Fun Action Movie! [8/10]
",panagiotis1993,02-Feb-24,"My Live Reaction / Review for The Beekeeper (2024): I have a feeling that this movie is gonna be good, let's see if im right or wrong. What is this? A group of people? A company that hacks random old people? Makes no sense. The poor lady killed herself after what happened? That's so sad. Adam is going to do something about it, I like it. Some really good fight scenes already! What Adam does is badass and everything but isnt he worried about the police? 40 minutes in and the movie is so good so far. I love that Jeremy Irons is in this one, I really enjoy his acting.So Adam was part of a secret group called the Beekeepers and now the same people will have to try and kill him? An all out war is coming, I like it. So Adam's next victim is POTUS or her son? Or both? Cant wait for Derek to die, he is so annoying! I like the president, she is honest. Wow, he gave that guy with the yellow short a really good beating. Derek is dead, hell yes. Overall the movie is pretty good. Good direction, an ok plot, good performances, intense action, fight scenes, explosions and more. It has everything you need, my rating is 8/10.","

For those of us who like action movies on the other hand know what we get with a Jason Statham movie. This one will not disappoint as it's a fast moving, exciting, piece of action that's worthy of the $11 ticket price.Some of the best action sequences on film are here with a pretty decent little revenge story. I found myself rooting for Statham as he kicks apart the greedy corporate culture that preys on unsuspecting people.Turns out his character is one you don't want to mess with or piss off especially when it comes to his friends. I found myself comparing the current presidential administration and tried to figure out was this the useless child of our current commander in chief or that person who lost in 2016. Anyhow, grab some popcorn and prop your feet up. Sit back and enjoy one of the best action movies to come out in a long time.","

The Beekeper," The main debate concerning this controversial picture . . .
",pixrox1,17-Jan-24,". . . is exactly WHICH Real Life American Presidential son THE BEEKEEPER is after. Many contend that it is the Weasel Shrub. However, a nearly equal number of commentators argue in favor of Don Juan, Jr. The True Facts favoring the former correlation includes top CIA family connections, a rigged election decided in a disrespected kangaroo court and a well-known history of alcohol and drug abuse by the sordid Skull & Bones Club whelp. Couple this with the thoroughly documented Texas barbecue during which details such as the unprecedented September 2001 Homeland Security Air Force stand-down to enable Manhattan's destruction by picnic guest O. B. L. And his henchmen and you have a very strong case for the fictional beekeeper offing a stand-in for the Weasel. However, given the still-missing folder of Tip-Top Secret nuclear codes and the KGB's first success at planting an agent and his Iron Curtain Third Lady in the West Wing, paired with his rants on the Voice of Lenin TV channel dominating Red State television screens, and Don Juan II seems to be an equally likely candidate for the beekeeper's mode of vigilante justice.

The Beekeper," If you like John Wick and Hitman game series, you'll love it!
",sinscopefilms,12-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper (2024) dazzles with its masterful cinematography. The film utilizes a mix of one-shots, medium, and full shots, with the characters artfully positioned at the center which was a standout feature of the film. These shots are rich in detail, benefitting from exceptional lighting that adds an impressive depth to each scene. The camera shots during the at night scenes are exceptionally clear, and the slow zoom-ins and outs are executed flawlessly.The cinematography is further elevated by inventive techniques, such as the seamless rotation from a 90-degree angle to a flat landscape view in the drone shots, adding a dynamic layer to the visual storytelling.The film draws inspiration from the atmospheric tones of Interstellar (2014) in its musical composition. The score is a fascinating blend of horror film elements, electronic stutters, and cinematic Hans Zimmer brass, creating an immersive auditory experience that complements the film's tone perfectly.Action sequences in 'The Beekeeper' are nothing short of breathtaking. Their realism is so striking that they left me in awe, my reaction a mix of surprise and excitement. These scenes are meticulously choreographed, echoing the intense action of Tenet (2020) while maintaining their unique flair.At the heart of the film is the protagonist, Adam Clay, a hitman characterized by his strategic brilliance. Clay's ability to think 15-20 steps ahead in order to unravel a scammer fraud scheme adds a gripping, intellectual element to this action thriller. The film, while drawing parallels with Saw X (2023), stands out with its unique narrative focused on scammer themes.I felt that The Beekeeper (2024) could benefit from a brief epilogue scene, despite its numerous strengths. Adding an exploration of Adam Clay's life after the climactic events of the film could have brought more depth to the story. This brief glimpse into his future could have provided a sense of closure to his character arc, giving the audience a deeper understanding of his transformation and the impact of his choices. A scene like that would have given the film a more complete ending and added depth to its emotional impact.In conclusion, 'The Beekeeper (2024)' is a cinematic treat, a guilty pleasure that blends masterful cinematography, a captivating score, and thrilling action sequences into a unique and memorable film experience.","

There are 2 prime actors (Statham, Irons) and some actors with lower profiles and famousness. The story and plot is straight: Revenge with no remorse. There is nothing else. So, one could take that simple thing and go with that and put it in a half-decent, fitting story and script that. What does not fit that script is wooden dialoges, acting and lineup based on a scrummy script and casting. There is simply too much distance and non-fittance in the lineup. Then, there are the story elements after the beginning - again, too much rotten wood. And then, the finale, which is not understandable: Is it a comical, satirical garden party with kids hunting each other or does the producer think, this can be take serous?All in all and unfortunately, a movie, that will be forgotten fast on the heap of kind of too cheap chunk... How desperate or well paid were Irons and Statham to hitch their wagon to this... ?","

The Beekeper," The Beekeeper
",Prismark10,05-Feb-24,"The Beekeeper is ludicrous action film kept in the air by Jason Statham's action wings.Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a mystery man who keeps bees and makes honey from a parcel of land leased from his neighbour Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad.) She is a retired teacher living in a remote farm. Eloise is scammed when her computer hard drive is infected and a helpline tricks her.She loses all her money and takes her own life. The scammers are headed by obnoxious young man called Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson.) He is a spoilt drugged up brat running tech firms who regards himself as untouchable. His mom is the president of the USA.Clay decides to go after the Queen Bee. Chasing him though is Eloise's daughter, Verona an FBI agent who wants to bring the scammers down by the book. Trying to stop him is retired head of the FBI, Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons) who now works for the Danforths handling their security.Adam Clay wants to do things his own way. He retired from a shadowy black ops agency called The Beekeepers. Even Westwyld knew little about them when he was at the FBI.The plus are the action scenes. Although I'm not sure how all these FBI agents and paramilitary groups managed to miss Clay with all their guns. The negatives are the story, laughably bad. The character of Eloise's daughter is atrocious. There was no buzz about her at all.","

The Beekeper," Statham merited more
",r96sk,01-Feb-24,"I'm conflicted about 'The Beekeeper'.On the one hand, it's fantastic entertainment as Jason Statham plays a brilliantly badass character - every scene with him is top, top notch. The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.Away from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. On the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.Raver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.The scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term shudder) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.I'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.","

",Mrbigham13,20-Jan-24,"I decided to see what all the Buzz was about tonight and take a look at this recent flick. This is just another run of the mill Statham action flick, but this time with a real sting in the end. Jason Statham the man I grew up with as ""The Transporter"" kicks ass per usual. The set pieces suffice with some obvious CGI explosions here and there. The supporting actors are good enough and of course all the villains are white with the ""United Nations"" of heroes serving as the FBI.This story really goes out on a limb, as do most action flicks these days. The political satire was just about as dumb as the real thing. I enjoyed the pot shots towards the Biden and Clinton crime families. Overall it's not a bad movie if you turn off your mind which seems to be all we do these days considering the low quality ""woke"" entertainment we're fed. What we have here is a real honeypot of cliche action mixed with standard modern day ideology. Nothing groundbreaking but pretty much expected, check it out.","

",donmurray29,12-Jan-24,"Giving this an 8/10 ratingDavid Ayer has been quiet on the film making front, but he is back, with this superb guilty pleasure action film. Writer Kurt Wimmer teams up with Jason Statham again, but this time the result is much better.There is much fighting, lots of great humour and yes there is a story, which is brought really to light by a much beer than I expected script, and some proper good acting, and the direction and pace is sedate in the right places, then bursts of action when it's needed.Jeremy Irons is very super cool and elegant all the way though, Jason Statham is totally driven as the beekeeper, and you learn a lot about bees along the way, Emmy Raver-Lampman is focused and also driven, Bobby Naderi is the suffering partner who is very sarcastic, but most of all, Josh Hutcherson, who was last seen in 'Five Nights at Freddie's' has fun with his role switch, his character is dislikable and we all have meet people in real like like him, he's superb too.This is more like 'Nobody', that stared Bob Odenkirk, not 'John Wick', which I have been reading companions too.

",Boristhemoggy,31-Jan-24,"Jason Statham is Adam Clay, a former secretive ops agent (retired) who is dragged back into action by heartless cyber scammers who attack his friend.Jason is the only real action hero worth watching at this moment in time. You can call him cheesy and corny and indeed he is but he does it so perfectly you don't care.Some of the dialogue would be laughable in other films, some of the scenes would be classed as unrealistic in other films, and happily there's not a gun involved with unlimited magazine. :)
There's plot holes galore and some very questionable scenes and yet...this film is fabulous. I loved it and sat without moving from start to finish.Statham has that electrifying presence that makes you forced to watch him and in any other hands this film would have been a porker. But Statham safely guides us through moral righteousness, revenge, justice and a very relevant criminal committing cyber scams is his ultimate target.Entirely watchable, entirely enjoyable, The best action film in a while bar none!","

The Beekeper," Jason At His Best
",stevendbeard,13-Jan-24,"I saw The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham-the Expendables movies, the Fast & the Furious movies; Emmy Raver_Lampman-The Umbrella Academy_tv, Central Park_tv; Josh Hutcherson-Five Nights at Freddy's, the Hunger Games movies and Jeremy Irons-House of Gucci, Assassin's Creed.This is an action packed Jason Statham movie and I think it's Jason at his best. Jason plays a beekeeper that takes care of bees. He lives in the barn of an elderly lady while doing his bee business-collecting the honey, etc. When she is scammed out of all her money, she commits suicide which makes Jason mad. That is when you find out that Jason is also another type of beekeeper. There is an organization called Beekeepers that takes care of things the regular police or F. B. I. Can not-or won't-handle. Jason is retired but decides to come out of retirement and use his skills to bring justice to the bad guys by tracking them down and eliminating them, one by one. Emmy is the F. B. I. Agent trying to stop Jason and Josh is the bad guy running the scamming business through several locations. Jeremy plays an ex C. I. A. Agent that works for Josh and knows how dangerous the Beekeepers are and tries to warn Josh about who he is messing with. There are lots of great fight scenes as the F. B. I., police, S. W. A. T.-and even another Beekeeper-try to stop Jason.It's rated R for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

The Beekeper," Expose the corruption. Protect the hive.
",Cinema-reviewer321,31-Jan-24,"What I expected from an action movie starring Jason Statham called The Beekeeper (2024) was that it was going to be a dumb fun action movie with entertaining action and a great performance from the lead actor, along with the director David Ayer giving the movie some kind of style to it; after watching the movie I got what I thought I was going to get, and had an entertaining time watching it. The action movie The Beekeeper (2024) is an entertaining, dumb, and fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously with the lead star being cool to watch, the action sequences being well done, and having simple but easy to hate antagonists; this movie does have issues like some of the dialogue and how the third act is played out, but if you think about any issues in the movie, then the whole thing will fall apart, which is why I say it's a dumb and fun action movie.Jason Stathan as Adam Clay was great to watch him go on a revenge quest to get back at a big company of scammers that did something wrong to a person that he knew that lead to her being killed, so it is satisfying to see him kill off these bad people because you know they have wronged him in such a way that should not happen again; I also liked the certain skills he has in fighting, knowing ways to get in a building, and how he handles situations. Seeing him do his beekeeping job was fine and I liked how he uses certain beekeeping methods against people he is fighting; other than him, there is the daughter of the person Adam Clay knew who died and she is some kind of FBI agent following the brutal trail of murders from Adam Clay leading to the higher ups of the scamming company, but her moments at crime scenes were a bit unnecessary and was not that interesting even though it could have been, since she is connected to someone we know.The antagonist is mainly Josh Hutcherson's character who is a spoiled rich jerk who takes the money from the scammers and puts it out to other companies he owns, or he just uses it for pointless stuff leading to him unknowingly angering Adam Clay; the other character who is more of a father figure to Josh Hutcherson's character is played by Jeremy Irons, who has something to do with what is happening in the company, but not completely where he is also the Beekeeper's target. The action sequences are fun, well-choreographed, barely has any cuts, and is cool seeing the actor Jason Statham perform them with cool stunts and brutal kills in entertaining ways; Adam Clay does make quite a few bee puns, which can be unintentionally funny becomes the movie does not take itself too seriously, but sometimes the lines of dialogue could get weird and just too cheesy on how they are said. I do like the information we get on the organization known as ""Beekeepers"" and how they are used to protect people or protect the ""Hive"" leading to them having fun with the idea, but the third act took itself seriously on how it played out and how people were acting; it should have just kept going down the path of not taking itself too seriously.The Beekeeper (2024) has its issues, but it is a dumb and fun action movie starring Jason Statham that I was entertained by, and while watching thought it was like the other action movie John Wick (2014); the performances are good, the action sequences are fun, and the antagonist is simple and easy to hate so you can be satisfied by what happens to him. If you like cheesy dumb action movies, I would recommend this movie to you, but if you do not like intentionally funny and dumb action movies, then you should not watch this; I expected this movie to be fun and entertaining, and that is what I got.","

At 42 I still cheer, when good guys rough up bad guys. But The Beekeeper faces dozens of trained men head-on, no weapon in hand. (As if they were just regular people from the street,) And two characters were way over the top. The female Beekeeper was comically over the top. As was the blond merc towards the end.The fight scenes and the action, however are beautifully done. The whole movie is beautiful.A bit of modesty here and there, would have scored a 9/10.The last point deduction would be the yuppie villains that are also a bit cartoonish in their behavior (except Jeremy Irons).Still waiting for that one perfect Statham movie.","

",bradencn,04-Feb-24,"Listen, I knew what to expect going into this film as far as what kind of movie it would be. Statham plays a great bad ass, and good guys (or guy) are fighting bad guys, and it's clear who's who.But by golly, folks, can we stop pretending that women are hard core police agents and leaders/directors of secret mercenary organizations? It just distracts completely from what I came to watch, it is dishonest and disingenuous, and it's an insult to viewers who just want to enjoy a work of art. For a work if art to have relevance, it HAS to reflect the human experience.So - will this movie resonate with action thriller chancing movie goers? Yes, it's worth watching on a steaming service, but...will the macho women scenes bother and distract you? Yes...further, they will annoy you.I wish Emmy Raver-Lampman a great career, but this movie makes it seem like she is just begging for relevance, and it's probably not even her fault... It's the fault of the writers, the casting requirements, etc.I didn't even mind the dumb dialogue. I came for the action, and I got the action... But it somehow got mixed with visual preaching that women can only be bad asses if they can be like men. Nah...not buying it.","

Increases together with big big number of pistols and automatic rifles and we see no bullet ever grazing him, then it starts delving into super cheesy action flick chaos.Those being said, 'The Beekeeper' is still one of the best Jason Statham's movies in years and a strange one cause it needed to be made 15-20 years ago within 'The Transporter' era.It is never too late and it deserves a speedy sequel as ""The Beekeepers"" are always alive and out for justice!P.

There are plenty of enjoyable moments here, and audiences who want nothing more than a Jason Statham beat-'em-up will surely be satisfied.There's a half-hearted plot twist that doesn't land. Mostly, however, this is a film about explosions and bad guys getting their comeuppance. Fast cuts and more than 50 credited stuntmen and stuntwomen make for, well, buzzy spectacle. A semi-confusing script and heavy-handed direction from David Ayer muddle the proceedings, but enough inspired pizazz and Statham's earnest delivery of lines like ""I protect the hive"" just barely bring it all home.My Rating : 6.5/10.","

The Beekeper," The good news..
",A_Different_Drummer,01-Feb-24,"... is that Jason Statham at 56 still has it and so does director David Ayer. The two combined forces to develop a story that can best be described as ""every film Charles Bronson ever made with software revisions by a programmer called John Wick."" The action starts almost immediately and then just goes. If you like memes and themes with your action, then there are some scenes where the importance of being nice to older people pop up, and also also some talk of the importance of being a good person. But all that is just talk. At the end of the day (and by the end of the film), the action takes center stage. It helps if you know the filmography of both Bronson and Statham (which would help you relate to the ""be nice to old people"" meme), but you can also enjoy a cold viewing if needs be. Very little wokeness here, an added bonus. The good old days... ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

The Beekeper," John Wick 1 with IQ0
",imdb-23821,14-Jan-24,"I love Jason Statham. I'll watch his nonsense like Crank, The Transporter (all three), and it's painfully fun to watch his best like Lock Stock and Snatch. But this dumb vehicle he walks through as does the rest of the cast, without even trying. Even the script seems to mock the audience and I'd say a poor man's John Wick 1 but that's a slap in the face to the poor version.Does this sound familiar? Wealthy magnate has son who is a brat and runs his own lower grade scams. One happens to hit close to Statham, just a quiet beekeeper. Without an effort, J calls up his posse to find out who it is and nobody knows. J decides to walk through the front door, wreak havoc, and let the FBI fumble at who this man of ultimate devastation can be for half the film. That's after he practically broadcast himself.Move forward and it only gets sillier and lazier. J must take down the entire organization. You could throw the army, navy, air force and marines at J but he'll walk in without a gun and let his super fast hands of steel (ala camera slight of hand) do the talking. Then he'll go John Wick style through all of them, even without a weapon, through dozens of them. Imagine a superhero film.There is really no point. Something about a beekeper, a hive, a queen bee, none of it really needing to make sense, just to sound diabolical. The problem is this isn't a parody nor meant to be one. It was just lazy junk. The ending might be the funniest of all, being only interested in a sequel. Don't say you weren't warned.","

Josh Hutcherson does surprisingly well as the movies villain. He does a very good job of playing a spoiled rich doosh bag that manages to get into WAY over his head. Several famous actors of yesteryear make appearances just to not do much and disappear after one or two scenes.

",destroyerwod,31-Jan-24,"Lets be 100% honest, this is the most John Wick clone of all John Wick clones that i have seen. Is it a négative? Absolutely NOT !This movie was awesome in its own right. Instead of a retired assassin who got wronged, here you have a retired super special agent who got wronged. Everyone tremble at the mere mention of his name. And he can dispatch pretty much anybody with super badass moves unless he reach his target. Sounds familiar? Everything in the structure of the movie, even to the ""special organization using outdated tech that somehow can find everything"", is very similar to John Wick. The bee theme is likely the only thing that is remotely original.But as i said in the intro, its not a negative for me. I like those action movies that were inspired by John Wick and if done properly like in this case, i would take a lot more. The story is simple but coherent, having Jason Statham as the lead assure a solid screen presence, the action is very good, and the movie as little timeoffs clocking at only 100 minutes or so. Its one of those solid action movies where you just buckle up for the ride and before you can even realize it, the movie is over.I don't buy as much movies on physical format these days as i used to, but its one that i will add to the collection.

By the end I was hoping one of the bad guys would just shoot Statham's character instead of standing there pointing their gun at him and waiting for him to knock them cold.The only way that a film like this could maintain interest is if the fight scenes showed some variety as the story goes along. This action director didn't seem to know what he was doing, and the endless, repetitive martial arts sequences seemed to be just filling time.","

The Beekeper," Embarassing, not even worth pirating
",wirednights,19-Feb-24,"With such a unique and eye-catching name as the Beekeeper, I was excited for this. I thought he'd use the bees to assassinate people, which would've been cooler than the actual movie premise. Then I started asking myself why I'm not watching John Wick instead. Staham in a raspy voice: ""Sometimes when there's dysfunction in the hive, you have to take out the queen"" lol ok. Is this the product of the writers strike? It would've been more believable if the call center was in India, not Massachusetts. But realism would upset someone. Beekeepers are a rip-off of Treadstone from the Jason Bourne series. The CGI office building explosion left me depressed. My conflusion: If you want real explosions, watch a real movie.They send a female beekeeper to take out Statham.. you probably forgot about her because she's dead in 30 seconds. Very anticlimactic and utterly pointless waste of runtime. The cringey Scottish guy at the end looks like a bad guy from Streets of Rage on Sega Genesis. Who writes this garbage? I can't believe Miramax put their name on this. This was worse than Thanksgiving 2023. I can enjoy brainless action movies, but this just did not work. Agent Verona Parker's character is so eye-rolling and unlikeable. She just sucked and was not believable as an FBI agent. Statham looks tired, he's less of a character in this movie and more of a plot device. Statham needs to retire, I'm not taking the bait again. He was good in Transporter 1 and The Mechanic, and that's all.","

The Beekeper," One of Jason's best
",saimariejohnson,07-Feb-24,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Beekeeper, and feel that the movie is incredibly relevant right now. With the rise of AI especially, the chances for schemes like the ones depicted in this film is quite valid and scary, but the idea that someone like Jason Statham just living his life in peace and trying to be a regular guy who is forced to the call of action via a horrible scenario that is deeply thought out and downright corrupt and wretch makes the movie suck you in and keep ahold to the very end. I think this is one everyone should see, especially as we see the increasing changes to life due to schematic fraud and those seeking to capitalize off innocent hardworking people in the most nefarious of ways.","

",daisukereds,01-Feb-24,"Jason Statham remains a quality lead, and an action actor to be respected.. even if the vehicles he is in sometimes stink.Thankfully, the Beekeeper is cheese enough to be enjoyable! With great build-up, increasing stakes, ""good"" bad people (not liking Hutcherson helped a lot, great casting) and dumb enough developments to be fun. But there's an underlying sense of competence that allows you to be entertained, and not laugh at the movie's expense.. maybe the dialogue could have been improved, but the general idea and execution is solid. The Equalizer comparison is quite apt!Easy recommendation for fans of the actor and action scenes with a purpose.If allowed, I'd give this half a point more than I did.","

The Beekeper," Suprisingly fun and entertaining
",dubond,31-Jan-24,"Don't let the January burial deter you from THE BEEKEEPER, a wild action thriller that works by enthusiastically embracing just how ludicrous it is, with every member of the cast, even down to the smallest role, knowing exactly what kind of movie they're in.In one of his best films, Jason Statham *IS* Adam Clay, a loner beekeeper renting a barn on the property of elderly widow Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise commits suicide after losing her entire savings in a computer virus phishing scam, Clay vows that those reponsible will pay, and he'd preferably do so without the involvement of Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Clay manages to find the office complex of the data mining outfit that conned Eloise, takes out several security goons and burns the place to the ground. All of this happens in the first ten minutes, which gives you an idea of just how hard THE BEEKEEPER hits the ground running and never stops. The data mining outfit is one of many overseen by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), a douchey, skateboarding billionaire tech bro rich kid who leaves the legalities and the paperwork to absurdly-named trusted family friend Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons), a former CIA director who has agreed to run the Danforth dynasty in the place of Derek's absent mother. When Westwyld reaches out to the current CIA director (Minnie Driver) and is told that all evidence points to Clay being a ""beekeeper,"" she wishes Westwyld the best of luck and extricates herself and the agency from the situation.What follows is absolute madness that almost makes this Statham's PUNISHER: WAR ZONE. It's the best film in years from either director David Ayer, who's a much better writer (TRAINING DAY, DARK BLUE) than a filmmaker (HARSH TIMES, SABOTAGE, SUICIDE SQUAD, BRIGHT, THE TAX COLLECTOR) or journeyman screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who's never lived up to the promise of 2002's EQUILIBRIUM. There's a jaw-dropper of a reveal midway through that I won't spoil, but this is Statham at his stoical, vengeful best, a welcome return to form after last fall's unwatchable EXPEND4BLES fiasco.THE BEEKEEPER is impossible to take seriously on any level, other than the palpable rage it shows toward greedy tech outfits that would con the elderly (it also doesn't seem likely that the FBI would let Verona work a case that indrectly involves her mother), but once all the pieces are in play, it also takes some pointed jabs at much bigger subjects. With perhaps the fewest lines he's ever had in a movie, Statham creates one of his most memorable and merciless characters, and the over-the-top, cathartically crowd-pleasing ways The Beekeeper comes up with to dispose of the bad guys had the small matinee audience rolling with laughter. Yeah, CGI explosions are apparently always gonna blow, but we've already got a contender for the year's most stupidly entertaining movie.","

Do i need to say more??? Entire movie is filled with hardcore action from good hand to hand combat, puching and kicking with some shootout scenes meanwhile epic one liners delivered by Jason's character Adam Clay...

",julianmarku,25-Jan-24,"This movie starts like a John Wick movie and ends like Jason Statham movie.It has a lot of cool fight scenes and I have to say I like Jason Statham in this movie because the director isn't trying to make a complicated story.In fact I would say that the director subverts almost every John Wick-ism it can stumble on. And anyone who is a fan of John Wick can have a good laugh about it.I have to praise the casting for this movie. Everyone and I mean everyone does their jobs great.Everyone from Jason Statham to Jeremy Irons is so good but with a script too small that it has to speed through the story. For example, early in the movie you will meet a character played by British actor David Witts, he didn't play a very important role but his performance impressed me enough to look him up. (I couldn't even tell he was British). Great actor, with a great face, born in the wrong time.It honestly feels like the weakest part about the movie was the script. But at least it's very tight and quick, not like the 3 hour special theatrical releases these days. I can at least respect that. You can watch this movie and not need to check your phone for the time every 15 minutes.All in all. It's a great Jason Statham popcorn action movie. Just maybe don't watch it with friends that have some strong political opinions...","

Last month's Silent Night was also a been-there-done-that action flick, but it didn't work as well because it was taking itself too damn seriously. The Beekeeper knows what it is and goes straight for it. Jason Statham talking about bee nonsense and protecting the hive was a hoot.I had a blast with it, and hope for a sequel.

The Beekeper," Almost artful. Statham's best.
",JohnDeSando,14-Jan-24,"""If a beekeeper says you're gonna die, you're gonna die."" Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons)When patrician bad boy, Oscar-winning Irons intones this threat/reality, you can figure The Beekeeper, Jason Statham's newest blood fest, may be a cut above his usual tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. It is, lusty as his revenge motif is and metaphoric as the title wants to be.Retired federal operative, read ""assassin,"" called a ""Beekeeper,"" Adam Clay (Statham),--hear the metaphor start ringing-- witnesses the exploitation of an elderly friend, Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), by ruthless internet scammers, ending in her suicide. Director David Ayer and writer Kurt Wimmer not quite subtly weave the analogy of Clay ridding the hive (read society) of bad bees, even ones at the very top of the hive's government.I know, The beekeeper is just another example of revenge porn, but they have crafted an early try at literacy while keeping us fed on the nectar of ramming order into a chaotic political world such as our current presidential race fosters. While the script may offer too many ham-handed allusions to the figurative underpinnings, I found myself pleased by the attempt and remembering how the Bard eloquently incorporated the motif into one of his bloodiest and most romantic battle plays when he speaks of""the honeybees, / Creatures that by a rule in nature teach / The act of order to a peopled kingdom."" The Archbishop of Canterbury in Shakespeare's Henry V.Statham, 56 and feisty as ever, is as stone faced as ever, but the surprisingly effective setup with the death of his friend at the beginning casts a serious and almost literate overlay to otherwise transparently fabulous death actions that would otherwise be plain silly. Avenging the scammed elderly seems noble given how many of us have seen the sudden blinking warning that our system has been compromised and don't do anything but ""Call this number!"" If you're old and electronic averse, you're ready to be scammed.Stepping outside the usually-absurd carnage, The Beekeeper touches on such important societal blights as corrupt political campaign funding and malicious interference of family members with otherwise benign politicians. Although bad boys are as bad, if not worse, than any you have seen in these oft-cliched thrillers, this film tries to be more original, topical, and literate with both the good and the bad.Not bad for a Statham cliche.",NA

I would love to see a sequel to this one, like he did for ""The Mechanic"". Other actors in this film, ehhh! Not so great. Agent Verona Parker maybe could have done without her. Didn't add much to the plot. The whole story line is a bit exaggerated with the POTUS being involved in the son's illicit gains. Don't think that was too smart of role selection.

The Beekeper," Statham fulfilling ""Statham duties"" well enough! [+60%]
",arungeorge13,30-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper really is one of those Statham action vehicles where you can laugh at the atrocity of the plot (and its developments) and just tag along for the undemanding ride. Yes, it does feel like a John Wick ripoff staged a bit differently, though director David Ayer knows how to play to Statham's strengths. He's once again a one-man-wrecking-machine, and Ayer exploits that by effectively stylizing the action blocks. Whenever Statham's off-screen, the screenplay (by Kurt Wimmer) carries a made-for-TV feel to it, with random and uninteresting banter between FBI officers. There are bee metaphors galore, and for what it's worth, the entirety of the last act is driven by one of them.Ayer reunites with his Street Kings colleague in DP Gabriel Beristain, who brings in a sense of slickness to the wider, more elaborate shots while also neatly balancing it out in the closer hand-to-hand combat sequences. I think Ayer realised early on that the script didn't offer anything new to engage the audiences, so he decided to keep things as delightfully campy as possible. As a result, we also gets a few moments of dark humour amidst the strictly R-rated action. Josh Hutcherson seems to have had a great time playing the antagonist (a swindling, fintech nepokid), and while he's never a physical match for Statham, the chase remains wholly watchable. For a January release, I guess this did alright.","

The Beekeper," It's An Action GENRE Movie...
",TerrificTom,09-Feb-24,"I'm afraid too many people don't know what a genre movie is.It's a movie with a very specific audience in mind and it caters to that audience, almost to a fault. In a genre movie certain things MUST happen and certain things CAN'T happen! These are NOT up for negotiation. Think: EVERY Hallmark movie EVER made. Does the girl ever NOT get the guy? Is the guy EVER a Bad Boy or a Bad Boy by the end of the movie? NEVER. I'm not even sure Hallmark movies EVER have bad boys! I'm only familiar with Hallmark Christmas movies because that's what my mother had on 16hrs a day from Thanksgiving to Christmas and if we visited you couldn't escape them.Well, this is an Action Genre movie and it hits just about EVERY cliche it MUST hit to fit into that genre and the RING is satisfying! Maybe one or two were missed but I didn't notice. The ones that do hit are hit HARD bringing real satisfaction!I forget. Does HE die in the end? Cuz that can happen in a genre movie.Who cares? If he did they can always resurrect him for the sequel! It happens in genre movies all the time. Why? Because when an audience decides it LIKES the hero, they want to see him again. And again. And again, etc., etc., ad infinitum! Genre movies and genre books are NOT ""literature."" There are no unwelcome or unwanted surprises in a genre story, UNLESS they are reversed before the final curtain.The challenge this puts on the writer and director is massive. They must find a way, against all odds, to make something unoriginal and formulaic LOOK original and innovative, without really originating or innovating anything. Now I admit, all of this sounds bad to the over-educated and highbrow among us - genre movies are what Martin Scorsese was talking about when he ripped on the MCU - but it doesn't have to be bad at all. If it can be done WELL. Hundreds of millions of people LOVE genre stories. Writers, producers, and directors have made untolded BILLIONS of dollars from them. Because when they succeed at the impossible, the millions and millions of action genre fans will reward them with word-of-mouth advertising and their film will make MONEY. Sometimes a LOT of money!I said all that so that if you identify as a fan of the action genre, this movie is definitely worth your time. But then, if you are a real action genre fan, you already intend to go see it!So go. Because you will enjoy it as much as I did.","

",martingreen-71835,01-Feb-24,"Who doesn't love a good action movie hero.?Jason Statham never fails to deliver in his movies, and although most are over the top, non stop never ending and unrealistic action, they are easy to watch and thoroughly enjoyable.Over the decades we see many action movie heroes, and Jason seems to have firmly found his place in Hollywood.The acting is quite good, the fighting and action scenes are very much over the top, but what else would you be watching an action movie for.?This movie is certainly not going to challenge any viewer, but it delivers on entertainment to the max.Sit back, relax, and enjoy Jason doing his thing.","

The Beekeper," Old and good (and silly) revenge plot
",claytonbrevilieri,04-Feb-24,"I wanted an action movie and I got one.Statham, The Beekeeper, is the baddest of the bad asses.It has that eghties action movies vibe, with a plot that doesn't make sense, with dispensible underveloped characters that you don't care at least. But you're not here for the story, you're here to watch Statham dispatching bad guys and others not as bad when the circunstances demand. And he delivers. As long you are not looking for veracityAnd you get Jeremy Irons, classy as usual.They even can conceal a secret until it matters.If you are tired of pretentious movies and want something where you know good is good and bad is bad, you can watch this one.","

The Beekeper," Fun Little Action Ride
",mkhulaify,01-Feb-24,"If you're expecting a masterpiece, an Oscar-worthy movie, the you gotta manage your expectations. This is a great movie that's loud, exciting, over-the-top, and fun! It delves deep into the action genre and delivers exactly what you'd hope for from a Jason Statham film. The fight choreography is top-notch, and the stunts are heart-stopping. However, while Statham shines, some of the supporting characters feel poorly written and their performances fall flat, which can be distracting. Nonetheless, if you're in the mood for adrenaline-pumping entertainment, this movie delivers in spades. Watch it for a quick brainless fun time with not much expectations, and you'll enjoy it.","

The Beekeper," If you like John Wick, you will LOVE this
",ryanculp-95641,12-Jan-24,"I don't understand those saying the plot is weak, if you have any relatives who have been scammed or know about call centers and scammers you would know they are a prevalent problem in real life and now in this movie.The only person who ever cared for him was scammed of their life savings and the charity that they ran causing them to kill themselves over making such a mistake and losing everything. Therefore leading Jason on a rampage to go through call centers and make his way up to the top of the ""beehive"" and shut the hole operation down.The action in this movie was spectacular. There were some gruesome scenes at some points with fingers being chopped off, soldiers being hung from ceilings, the camera shots were low and moving so you could see blood splatter when enemies were shot in the head. Overall, the action in this film from gun combat and hand to hand combat is phenomenal and on par with John Wick.Rating: 10/10.","

The Beekeper," The Beekeeper caters to action junkies. This has some John Wick, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme vibes
",kevin_robbins,19-Feb-24,"My wife and I recently caught The Beekeeper (2024) in theaters. The plot follows a retired special agent who tends to a bee colony and shares moments with his aging yet appreciative neighbor. However, when his neighbor falls victim to a scam, he unleashes hell in retaliation.Directed by David Ayer (Suicide Squad), the film features Jason Statham (Crank), Emmy Raver-Lampman (The Umbrella Academy), Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers), and Phylicia Rashad (The Cosby Show).This movie is a chaotic mess. The acting and dialogue are horrendous and had a made-for-television vibe. It's a ""shut your brain off"" experience with over-the-top action scenes, some intentionally hilarious, and others so bad that they become amusing. The action choreography blends fights, knives, and gore brilliantly. The shootouts are fun. The bridge scene was excellent, ""unlucky"" conversation hilarious, the gas station sequence was wild and the brass knuckles fight cracked me up. There was some entertaining scene. Even Jeremy Irons seems awkward and out of place.In conclusion, The Beekeeper caters to action junkies. This has some John Wick, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme vibes. I would score this a 4/10 and recommend seeing it once.","

The Beekeper," An Above Average Action Film
",alindsayal,26-Jan-24,"Over the years, Jason Statham has been a part of plenty of action films which have differentiated in quality. We have another one with The Beekeeper and I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after someone close to him is robbed and killed, a Beekeeper goes on a revenge mission showcasing his former skills.Main Character
As mentioned above, Statham has played the lead role in an action film many times and he does a great job here, it feels like he can play this role in his sleep. It isn't the toughest role he has ever taken on but it just works and he adds some legitimacy for this role and it is fun to see him play a Beekeeper.Supporting Characters
Josh Hutcherson plays an annoying bad guy here and it took a while but I liked his performance here. He is just so arrogant and annoying that you really want to see him get taken down and this made me root for Statham even more in this film.Jeremy Irons plays the head of the company that Statham is after. He again is good in the role and is charisma is on full display here. It is probably one of the easiest pay checks that he has ever got but he is clearly enjoying the role.Emmy Raver-Lampman plays a cop and I didn't really care for her performance. She is a bit over the top and her character just makes some strange decisions and it is kind of convoluting as to why she does certain things in the film.Bobby Naderi plays her partner and he is also cheesy and really over the top. The two of them have decent chemistry but for me it doesn't really work in this film.Story
The story is pretty basic here and focuses on this guys revenge mission and in that it is pretty cool and exciting seeing Statham's character go after the people that have wronged him and the people he knows. There is also a pretty cool twist towards the end of the film that made things way more interesting. But some of the others character motivations are pretty strange and the overall explanation for Statham's training doesn't work with other things that happen in the film. Worse of all is the really abrupt ending of the film that doesn't really answer any questions and feels really out of place.Script
This is where the film really falls flat and that is the writing. This film has some real cringe worthy dialogue here, especially when it comes to the bee metaphors. But it is like the film doesn't have an ending and like the writers weren't sure what to do.Style
The film has some really great action sequences. The majority of people are just here to see Jason Statham beat up and kill people and you get that here in spades and it is easily the highlight of the film. The film also has pretty good pacing, it doesn't overstay its welcome and I thought moved pretty well.Overall
Overall, The Beekeeper is an above average action film. Statham is great and the action is fun to watch but it is exactly what you would expect. This is probably one to watch when it comes to streaming at home instead of rushing to the cinema to watch it.Rating - 6/10.","

The Beekeper," Makes REACHER look subtle and sophisticated
",Couchkik20,30-Jan-24,"I like that the pitch is what if Halloween's Jason (or any immortal slasher killer) was the good guy. This movie makes REACHER look gentle, sophisticated and subtle. The silliness of this movie is enjoyable. We're talking 80s dumbness with a bit of Luc Besson's movie's shiny look and stupidity. This is a violent comedy vaguely inspired by John Wick but happy with being fun and crazy with some bad CGI explosions.Of course you have the diversity female part as the badass cop to side with our invincible white hero. Jason Statham is half Bruce Willis half video game meathead and the less he talks the more he's in character. Josh Hutcherson looks like Jack Harlow if he was in Duran Duran. Dialogues make no sense, villains are from Gotham's gutter and the Beekeeper can enter any room, access any building, borrow any vehicule if needed, defeat all adversaries.Thanos would have lost against the Beekeeper .","

The Beekeper," buzz and kill
",ferguson-6,09-Feb-24,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those who take pride in their ability to keep track of body counts in movies, I can only say, best of luck with this one. Boom. Bang. Punch. Kick. Stab. Choke. Flip. Our hero, acting alone, uses every available attack to neutralize armies, SWAT teams, trained security teams, and greedy scumbags ... all in the name of ""protecting the hive"". OK, it's mostly for revenge for causing the death of ""the only person who took care of me.""
Director David Ayer (END OF WATCH 2012, SUICIDE SQUAD 2016) and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (SALT, 2010) are very much at home in the action-violence genre, and adding the king of cinematic hand-to-hand combat, Jason Statham, to the mix can only mean more action and more fighting and more violence. There is no reason to critique a movie that delivers exactly what it sets out to deliver to an audience that expects exactly that.Statham is in prime form as Adam Clay, a beekeeper on a farm owned by retired teacher Elise Parker (Phylicia Rashad, CREED). When a phishing scam drains her bank accounts, including that of the non-profit she administers, Clay reacts to the subsequent tragedy by tracking down the culprits of the scheme. Tech fraudsters are easy targets because we all despise them, and the film plays that up by exaggerating the obnoxious nature of those involved. A miscast Josh Hutcherson (THE HUNGER GAMES) plays Derek Danforth, an entitled little bleep who skateboards in the office to his next massage and wears outlandish outfits befitting a person desperate for attention. Adding to the psychological drama is FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman, ""The Umbrella Academy""), the daughter of Elise, the woman who put Clay on his mission of reckoning.Additional supporting roles include Bobby Naderi as Verona's FBI partner, Jemma Redgrave as the President, a brief appearance by Minnie Driver as the FBI director (she takes three quick phone calls), and Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Wallace Westwyld, the retired agent charged with keeping Derek safe. The hook here is that beekeeper Clay is actually a retired secret agent known as ""the Beekeeper"", and in one of the oddest sequences, his replacement (a wild character inspired by Prince?) brings a Gatling gun to try and end Clay once and for all. The film is silly and absurd, and right up the alley of those who embrace Statham's stoic bulldozer of a man.","

The Beekeper," Does the job if you are in the mood for some mindless action
",ethanbresnett,13-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper is a relatively unambitious film that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or push the boat out too much. It all feels very derivative of the genre with no element of it particularly standing out.If you manage to wade through the tiresome bee metaphors, the clunky cliche dialogue, and Jason Statham's sporadic attempt at an American accent, there are some entertaining action set pieces to get stuck into.I do also think that the plot is perfectly decent. Nothing special but it moves along at a decent pace even if it is entirely ridiculous.Overall the Beekeeper is far from being a great, or even really a good film. But on the plus side it's not god awful. It's one of those films that has a time and a place, so if you are in the mood for some mindless action it will scratch that itch for you.","

The Beekeper," The Beekeeper
",CinemaSerf,16-Jan-24,"""Clay"" (Jason Statham) has worked for an off-the-books US government programme designed to provide the ultimate security to the democratic process by providing unlimited training and resources to a group of people whose job it is is to objectively protect the system. These folks are called ""beekeepers"" which is lucky because our Jason has decided to spend his well earned retirement doing precisely that. He rents some space in the barn of ""Eloise"" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter ""Verona"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. ""Clay"" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with ""Clay"" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.","

The Beekeper," Totally irrational and over the top, and yet, I enjoyed it
",FixedYourEnding,09-Feb-24,"The Beekeeper is a typical Jason Statham action movie, with lots of fights, explosions, and cheesy one-liners. Statham plays a former assassin who goes on a revenge spree against a corrupt tech company that ruined the life of a friend. The plot is thin, the dialogue is bad, and the villains are cartoonish and forgettable, the movie is ridiculous, over-the-top and even offensive at times, but... I totally enjoyed it.The revenge on the bad actors in this film (no pun intended) is really fun and rewarding, it is like all the people you wished you could do that to got the revenge in the way the deserve. Statham is doing his usual job in inflicting pain on everybody that stands in his way, the pacing in the movie is great and there is never a dull moment. Statham is the action, everything else is a 2nd fiddle in his symphony, including the supporting actors, are all there to be props in his quest.And yes, don't try to make sense of the story while watching this, it will ruin the movie for you. This is a beer (or coke) and popcorn movie start to finish. The tech part in the movie, as well as all the government conspiracies, although based on real occurrences is completely blown out of proportion but still a lesson to be had. The bees knew what they were doing.Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this action flick! Exact score: 68 / 100.","

The Beekeper," A child could write a better script
",johnmichaelhilliard,18-Feb-24,"I'm a huge Jason Statham fan but Christ alive this is easily the worst movie of his career. There's some pretty awful acting going on but the script is the real criminal here. How they got the likes of Jeremy Irons, Phylicia Rashad, Minnie Driver and Statham himself to appear in this movie is beyond belief. I also find it hard to believe that the writer of this drivel, Kurt Wimmer, is the same guy who wrote the action thriller 'Salt' starring Angelina Jolie, which is a seriously underrated film. I don't wish to put spoilers into this review or give away any of the plot, so I won't, but just to give you an idea of how poor this film is, all the Secret Service agents are running around wearing armoured vests with SECRET SERVICE written on the back in huge letters. How secret would the service be if they all wore vests proclaiming who they were in giant letters? This is just the tip of a huge iceberg of goofs and plotholes, highlighting how bad this film really is.","

The Beekeper," The Cinematography, Editing, Action & Acting are Buzz Worthy, The Script is Laughable
",CANpatbuck3664,26-Jan-24,"The reviews I've seen for The Beekeeper laud it for being ""straightforward fun"" and ""an enjoyable throwback."" The underlying message is that The Beekeeper is enjoyable if you can appreciate it for the genre thrills. Now that I've seen it, you're going to get what you want from the action. Bones are broken, bullets go flying and the bad guys are punished for their misdeeds in a satisfying and well utilized manner. I actually think the team behind the camera deserves a lot of credit for this. David Ayer gets a bad rap for a couple of lacklustre movies sprinkled in with a few great ones (including one that's in the pantheon of my all time favourites, EoW) but his direction here is at least a level above from what you typically get in this style of movie. The Beekeeper boasts Ayer's famous gritty feel and this also accents the fight scenes. But I also think the movie looks really good between the cinematography and being cut together really well so I want to credit Director of Photography Gabriel Beristain and Editor Geoffrey O'Brien for helping The Beekeeper punch above it's weight class.I've already admitted to being a big fan of David Ayer but I'm also a longtime defender of Jason Statham. He's one of the few leading men with the chops and screen presence to lead an action movie in our modern cinematic environment (without putting on a superhero costume). He's a decent actor but more importantly, he's also secretly hilarious when given the opportunity (if you get a chance, check out his turn as Rick Ford in Spy, he's phenomenal in that movie). I was excited that he was getting another potential franchise to lead but while he's certainly bringing his physicality to Adam Clay, there's a complete absence of his charm. He mostly grunts his way through the proceedings and his character felt like a rehash and the type of role he was parodying with his appearance in Spy. There's some really talented names in the supporting cast as well and I thought many of them shone through some so-so material. Jeremy Irons brings his gravitas to the character of Wallace Westwyld. He's relatively grounded compared to some big performances from his cast mates and I enjoyed his measured take. I've always really liked Emmy Raver-Lampan in the Umbrella Academy and I think she's the overall standout in The Beekeeper. She's very serious in her early appearances (to the desired effect) but I liked her even better when she's cracking wise and trading buddy-cop barbs with her on-screen partner played by Bobby Naderi. She's definitely got one of the more fleshed out characters but she's got range and hopefully her work here will lead to more roles in movies. To my pleasant surprise, my other favourite performance was Josh Hutcherson as the unbelievably slimy Derek Danforth. This might not seem like a compliment as he's playing such a detestable character but I thought he was appropriately smarmy and unlikeable without chewing on the scenery (e.g. The admittedly fun but hammy job done by David Witts). I wouldn't have imagined Josh playing a villain but he exceeded my expectations in this role and he deserves kudos.I've mentioned the acting, the film making and the action but I have to get to the elephant in the room now. The script for The Beekeeper was shockingly inept and I kept wondering how it was greenlit in this condition? Travesty is a little dramatic but Holy Underwritten Plot & Characters Batman! Admittedly, some movies walk a fine line in tonality but not everything has to be deadly serious. There's also such things as enjoyably cheesy or deliberately hammy. I had some trouble deciding if that's what The Beekeeper is aiming for. The action scenes are unflinchingly savage and the film has a mostly-serious rhythm (the all-too-real scams, the political intrigue and government bureaucracy don't seem satirical) but then there's the tongue in cheek joking, the one-liners, the knockoff Wolf of Wall Street bravado from the villains, the constant talking about literal and metaphorical bees and over-the-top elements (a rival beekeeper whipping out a mini-gun at a crowded gas station kind of decision) that suggest it's a secret/surprise comedy. Are the filmmakers being deliberately silly? Are they in on the joke? Is The Beekeeper laughing with the audience or just missing the mark with unintentional comedic results? I couldn't really get a firm grasp on the desired tempo here but the conclusion I arrived at was that the film was serious and that the story and the script missed it's mark. The Beekeeper reminded me a little of the movie Skyscraper when it would careen into silliness. There's no doubt that parts of this movie were designed to be funny but I wasn't just laughing at those deliberate choices and I don't think that was what the creative team had in mind.I really tried to meet The Beekeeper on every level. My combined love of both David Ayer's and Jason Statham's work, an appreciation of straight-to-the-point action the movie boasts and a cast that showed up to work (extra credit to Emmy Raver-Lampman and Josh Hutcherson). I kept hoping for a gradual turnaround, a twist that would shift the narrative from bouncing between solid action to some disappointingly goofy dialogue and storytelling, or an ending that would ratchet up the proceedings. But it wasn't in the cards and while I don't disagree that The Beekeeper is a serviceable vehicle for some satisfying Statham punching & kicking but this movie could have been a lot better. I saw this with a friend in an empty theatre and we were laughing, rolling our eyes and cracking jokes throughout. I would actually like to give this team another crack at it if everyone was able to return (except Kurt Wimmer, he can just stay home). There's a lot of talent assembled here, I just think they hit a ground rule double instead of a home run. Check The Beekeeper out if you're a fan of Jason Statham or if you can tune out your inner critic and just enjoy the action.","

The Beekeper," Typical Statham so no surprise here.
",deloudelouvain,17-Feb-24,"If you have a problem with Jason Statham don't watch this movie because it's the same character he always plays. You know, the one that is untouchable, a real mean badass with a soft heart for justice, the guy that will take out a whole army by himself, preferably without weapons as that would be way too easy for him otherwise. You have to be able to get over that otherwise you will never like a movie with Jason Statham. I found The Beekeeper one of his better ones. A good revenge story, with of course an overload of action scenes. The cinematography was of good quality, nicely choreographed fighting scenes, and good actors. Of course I wished it would look a bit more realistic, like almost everyone of us, but it is what it is, a Jason Statham movie. If one day he could take out villains in a normal way I think that movie could score higher. I would have scored The Beekeeper higher if it wasn't Jason against fifty highly trained killers, preferably all at once of course.","

",healingtoolbox,16-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper's theme and moral ambition is a thousand per-cent clearer than 2016's Suicide Squad. Many of the same themes here, all much more clear-cut. This gives Japan Stratham strong moral momentum which wasn't possible in Squad. Perhaps the best Jason movie since Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw?This is a movie where you can and you do cheer when the bad guys get their just desserts. The audience I saw it with cheered out loud at the end. Since the 1980s, screenwriters have mostly beat up on international drug cartel lords.The Beekeeper suggests a better target. Beat up on internet hackers who prey on the public, amoral Tech Bros and anyone higher, whose allegiances are not ""for the good of the hive,"" translation: for the highest good of the 99% of working families, not just for elite interests.Jeremy Irons provides a valuable counterpoint to Jason. Jeremy is the older voice of reason; yet also, of the olf elite status quo. Jeremy is not the main villain. He represents the older generation who enable younger villains because it pays well.I especially liked how the motivations driving five or six supporting characters were fleshed out; and, how their varied motivators came into conflict. This made all the characters more believable.I'm ready for Beekeeper #2.","

The Beekeper," The Beekeeper: Buzzkill or Bite-Sized B-Movie Bonanza?
",aleksovski92,17-Jan-24,"Okay, let's get this out the hive right away: The Beekeeper didn't sting me the way I hoped. Jason Statham as a vengeance-fueled ex-spy? That's usually my honey pot. But this particular batch left me feeling a bit... sticky.First off, the visuals. The cinematography felt uninspired, lacking the crispness and dynamism that could have elevated the action sequences. And while the explosions delivered a certain boom, they lacked the visceral punch that truly immerses you in the scene.Speaking of Statham, he's the undeniable highlight. Dude throws punches with raw intensity, and his signature grit shines through every scene. But even Statham can't fully salvage the plot. The twists were predictable, and the supporting cast's motivations felt underdeveloped, leaving them mostly as one-dimensional action fodder.The saving grace, however, is the action itself. Statham commits to every fight, delivering brutal choreography that's undeniably entertaining, even if the CGI occasionally falters. It's like they poured all their budget into Statham's stunt doubles and said, ""Meh, the rest can be pixelated bees, who cares?""So, should you check out The Beekeeper? Well, if you're a die-hard Statham fan and crave mindless action, then maybe. Just set your expectations for a B-movie experience with predictable twists and underwhelming visuals. Otherwise, you might be better off buzzing over to something else. This hive ain't worth the sting.","

The Beekeper," This Might Just Be Jason Statham's John Wick
",SAMTHEBESTEST,17-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper (2024) :
Movie Review :David Ayer directs Jason Statham in an action-packed drama, The Beekeeper. This title has a sweet meaning, but I dare you call this film or the Beekeeper's character sweet. That's sour and spicy, for sure. Jason Statham has done popular action films like Transporter, The Italian Job (a thriller), The Mechanic, The Expendables, and Fast & Furious movies, but has struggled a bit in the recent past. The Beekeeper is an answer to that struggle, maybe. We all know plenty of kick assss action movies, but John Wick has that universal recognition like no other film when it comes to the pure, mad action genre in this millenium. The Beekeeper might just be that John Wick kind of chapter in Jason's book. This is not an exaggeration, but a comparative statement, and don't misread ""might be"" as ""is"". It's an arguable statement to avoid direct comparisons and fan wars.Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), a retired schoolteacher who has never done a bad thing in her life and has devoted her time to charity, is scammed by a huge online racket. Devasted, she commits suicide. Adam Clay (Jason Statham), a beekeeper working at a garage, shared a good bond with her. Eloise's daughter, Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman), is an FBI agent, and she arrests Adam for his mother's death. Soon, the investigation reveals that it was a suicide, and then Clay is released. Verona informs Clay that the group that scammed her mother has been on the FBI's radar for some time but is difficult to track. Adam then takes his own path to find the gang and runs mad on a murder spree. His last target is Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), who tries his best to stop him, but he is unaware of what a beekeeper means and how dangerous he is. I don't think I should give away any spoilers on Beekeeper's identity and work and how he takes on the entire gang alone, so let's keep that part fresh for your viewing experience.Kurt Wimmer writes a basic revenge drama, and the screenplay adds some thrilling and brutal moments. Each time the Beekeeper is out hunting, he stings, and he stings sharply and on the right spot. Some nerve-breaking killing moments will have your eyes filled with blood, and there will be a lot of blood in front of your eyes as well. The Beekeeper has some insanely ridiculous theories about its main character and his features that look ridiculously unbelievable, but also ridiculously entertaining. I mean, let's say you want a hero who can beat anybody to pulp, can burn down any place, can breach security even at the president's party hall, and then come out of everything without a scratch. Wouldn't you freaking love him and scream for him? Kurt Wimmer has written Adam Clay, aka The Beekeeper, with all those features. The only problem with his writing is that it follows all those traditional packages you've been served for years. Predictability is not good for any film, unless it's a known/true story.Let's talk about Statham Man. He is a killer-a real one, I mean. Hobbs and Shaw showed his calibre and why he deserves to be one of the leading action stars in the F&F franchise, but sadly, the makers are too busy with others even after 10 movies. This man deserves a solo action movie like The Beekeeper to prove his talent. He scares hell out of everyone in movie, be it antagonists, cops, or even the bigger players in this game. Emmy Raver-Lampman gets a few good scenes, but even those aren't healthy ones. Josh Hutcherson is your rich, spoiled brat and, as expected, a greedy man and a drug addict. What more can you expect from him? Jeremy Irons plays the interesting character of Wallace, which I think had more scope but is cut short because he didn't really enter the game of blood. Phylicia Rashad and Jemma Redgrave's support is really helpful.The Beekeeper is a wacky action flick with superb action choreography. Geoffrey O'Brien's editing keeps it short and quick, with a gripping runtime of 100 minutes excluding credits. You'll see some decent framework by Gabriel Beristain that could have done better, especially the creative part of long action set pieces. The film has a few loopholes that should have been covered with some emotional quotient, but what's done is done now. The sound design and production design have been okay. It's good to see the man who made the first installment of the Fast & Furious franchise come up with such a violent flick that isn't about logic but is hardly illogical as far as a crowd-pleasing experience is concerned. Nevertheless, he delivers a worthy action drama for the devotees of the genre and devotees of Jason Statham. That retrograded ambition from 2001 could have been avoided, or, better yet, this film could have been made much earlier to have a better impact. But it's not that corny anyway. So, order your popcorn and sit for this 100-minute action-packed ride, and try and ask your theatre manager to skip the intermission break.RATING - 6/10*","

The Beekeper," Queen of the Damned
",southdavid,24-Jan-24,"I'm not the world biggest fan of this sort of midbudget action film, the ones that seem to end up on the streaming services rather than the big screen these days and whilst ""The Beekeeper"" isn't great it's unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and some decent turns in the support cast elevate it slightly above those.When his landlady Eloise (Phylicia Rashad) takes her own life, after her life savings are stolen from her by a cybercrime syndicate, Adam Clay (Jason Statham) sets out to avenge her. Clay though is not just an ordinary vigilante, he was once a Beekeeper, a member of a special government project, highly trained and given autonomy to make his own decisions about how to progress a situation. As Clay kills his way up the foodchain, chased by Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Clay comes to learn that the syndicate have ties to government agencies, that have the resources to mount a defence against his onslaught.So, all of the good work in this is done by supporting characters, particularly Raver-Lampman, so good in ""The Umbrella Academy"", and her partner in this, played by Bobby Naderi. Their scenes together elevate the film somewhat. Josh Hutchison is having a good time too, as a higher up douchebag who believes, and with some reason, that he's untouchable. One of the problems though is that Statham's character is pretty lifeless. He's proved in other films he's capable of being charismatic but here he just waffles on about Bees every chance he gets, which becomes hilarious the further you get into the film and the more frequently it happens. You can only mumble ""Protect the Hive"" so many times, before it ceases to lose all meaning.The action is fine, if perhaps lacking something truly interesting or memorable. The CGI work isn't as good as the practical stunts, and the fighting remains a touch below something like a ""John Wick"". If briefly threatens to accept its dumb nature, during a fight with another Beekeeper and become more fun, but doesn't commit to it for long.There's probably a desire to franchise the character, like has happened with other Statham films, but I really don't think there's much more meat on what was already a modest bone.","

",egg_egan,21-Jan-24,"What a great film. If you like the John Wick franchise and you love no nonsense action this is the film for you.Jason Statham is brillant as the one man killing machine who is just unstoppable in the most casual way possible. Once the action starts it never stops with some of the.scenes are brutally brilliant.As always I don't understand who watches films like this and can openly give it a poor rating. After watching the trailer it was obvious the film was going to be a no nonsense action film, and it delivered no questions asked. So if this type of film is not your cup of tea why watch it.Utterly brilliant and a must watch for those who love action films.","

The Beekeper," A fun bee-movie thriller
",eddie_baggins,18-Feb-24,"Let's be clear, if you don't go along with The Beekeeper chances are you're going to have a horrible time with a b-movie (or is that bee-movie?) that is both unashamed and unafraid of what it is from the moment it begins until the moment it ends but if you're willing to go along for the ride in this John Wick-lite actioner there's a very decent chance you're going to have an absolute blast.Likely to remain one of 2024's most surprising success stories, both with an unexpectedly decent critical reception and also a box office haul in excess of over $100 million worldwide (spawning what is likely to be a sequel in the near future), The Beekeeper is a return to form for both its director David Ayer and its main man Jason Statham who here both showcase their limited strengths to great effect, to gift us an old school action/vigilante experience that just so happens to love the odd bee quip or fact.Wasting little time getting to the crux of its tale centred around Statham's man of little words Adam Clay going on a bloodthirsty quest for justice against a corporation of greedy scammers that are overseen by Josh Hutcherson's detestable and scenery chewing Derek Danforth, The Beekeeper is as unbelievable and comical as the most over the top moments of any John Wick or Fast and the Furious offering but there's a glee and carefree nature to this tale that can't be denied, forcing one to pass over their sensibilities or better judgement and just go along for the carnage filled rides.From screenwriter and mastermind behind the Point Break and Total Recall remakes Kurt Wimmer's ham-tastic screenplay (""When someone hurts an older person, they are often left to face the hornets alone.""), Statham's po-faced delivery of death blows and direct dialogue and Ayer's typically chaotic direction, every element of The Beekeeper is gloriously OTT and filled with fine line balancing of tipping the scales too far, ending up managing to maintain a nature that is hard to not get behind.Without a takeaway message or anything holding it all together other than it's nice to sometimes see the irredeemably bad dispatched by a figure who decides justice is best served cold, Ayer's newest action packed outing may have little to ponder or look back on but for the brisk and event filled 100 minutes it covers, The Beekeeper does exactly what it set out to do and gives us a baggage free genre entry that reminds us all sometimes fun is all we need to keep us entertained.Final Say -A brazenly simplistic action thriller that loves its honey makers and dispatched bad guys, The Beekeeper is a film that tries little if at all to hide what it is and embraces its identity with a joy that's hard to not partake in.3 staples out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

The Beekeper," Weak film.
",eugabrieldacosta,19-Jan-24,"The movie, at times, loses itself in secondary plots, diverting us from what truly matters - the action led by the hero. This leaves us eager for the central character's return.Though the story echoes films like John Wick, it fails to capture the same striking essence. It resides in predictability, unable to secure a place in cinematic memory.The action scenes are good but not exceptional. The actors shine in fights, yet the excitement falls short of expectations.Overall, it's an action film that oscillates between captivating and monotonous moments. The first act is promising, the second disappoints, while the third redeems some of the lost brilliance.","

The Beekeper," Jason Statham headlines an enjoyably over the top action thriller which sets itself apart from many similar entries with a good sense of humor
",IonicBreezeMachine,15-Jan-24,"Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a solitary man who keeps bees on a parcel of land rented to him by retired schoolteacher Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise is scammed out of her personal finances as well as those of a charity she manages by phishing scam operation lead by Garnett (David Witts), Clay and Eloise' daughter FBI Agent Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman) soon find out that Eloise committed suicide with the perpetrators most likely going to evade prosecution. Taking matters into his own hands, Clay dives into his combat skills he learned as part of a clandestine organization known as Beekeepers intent on bringing down the criminals who drove Eloise to her death which takes him through the highest echelons of power.The Beekeeper is an action thriller directed by David Ayer and starring Jason Statham. In a month that's seen no shortage of assassin/secret agent based action thrillers (The Bricklayer, Role Play, The Painter, etc.) if you're going to watch one of these movies, then The Beekeeper is definitely the one to choose.The Beekeeper is about as simple a premise as you can ask for with Statham's Clay your archetypical strong silent protagonist who motivated by some loss embarks on a path of revenge. Even in his 50s Statham hasn't lost step when it comes to delivering the goods and the script plays itself with a bit more humor than you'd expect which allows Statham to tap into that snarky side that plays to his advantage. The movie delivers some solid antagonists in Josh Hutcherson and David Witts whose cocky arrogance bringing to mind the worst aspects of tech/NFT bro tropes make them easy to hate and Jeremy Irons is quite fun as the head of security who acknowledges their deaths are basically foregone conclusions after angering a Beekeeper and only continues to organize protection details for them out of obligation rather than believing anything can be done. With the quirky clandestined world established in the movie regarding the Beekeepers, the film has more than a few shades of John Wick or other films in its DNA and for the most part if this is the beginning of a franchise I'm interested to see where they take it. The one downside is a sideplot involving Emmy Raver-Lampman's character Verona and her partner Wiley played by Bobby Naderi. While I understand having a character who follows someone like clay through a story like this, Verona is very poorly written as she seems like she's more upset about Clay's rampage than her mother's death and every time the movie pulls back from Clay to focus on these characters it only serves to stop the flow and reiterate information we already know.The Beekeeper is a solid ""B"" film that delivers the goods thanks to Ayer's tight direction and the always welcome presence of Statham. The Beekeeper like its titular hero is quick, clean, and efficient and you'll get your money's worth.","

The Beekeper," The Action Is Abuzz In This One
",rgkarim,13-Jan-24,"LIKES:The Pace
-The movie is like most Statham led movies, very loud and very fast, much like the theme of his series Crank.-The Beekeeper doesn't pull its foot of the gas for much of the movie, and for those who love the adrenaline rush, you are in great shape to enjoy this film.-It pretty much stays at a nice hundred miles an hour, but also takes time to reset for some faster paced setups to get you ready for the next mayhem to unleash on the screen.-All in all, great for those with fleeting attention spans.The Humor
-Whether direct or indirect, I laughed a lot in this movie, so much so that it made me have some of the most fun in a film I have had.-The Beekeeper has plenty of zingers to sting your funny bone, making you crack up with the way Statham dryly delivers a message, or Irons sarcasm and logic comes out like Scar.-Poking fun at the government system and the political jokes were toned back, purposeful and nicely finessed to be very, very fun without being too much.-And throw the character profiles being extremely goofy and adding an element of their own only helping further make the ordeal stupid fun and entertaining, alongside some of the stunts and finishes that just scream suspense of disbelief.The Story To A Degree
-It's got a better story than I anticipated, one that is simple, easy to follow, and perfect anchoring to the mishaps coming.-The Beekeeper's story surprisingly has some decent character development to mix in, helping give some clarity to a few of the players in this weird game of extreme action chess.-And there is a little bit of a nice ""twist"" to the mix that should help give a little more to the plot they are conveying, but not enough to trip or offset the main focus of this movie.The Action Scenes On Many Moments
-Perhaps the meat of the movie, the action is all about what most will be coming to see this movie for, and I'll say, it's fun to say the least.-From the first bout on, Statham and the team get creative in just how much fun a special agent can have with the masses, providing lots of playgrounds to do battle on that help mix up the theme of the action at hand.-Throw in the combat essentially changing hands to be one part martial arts, one part knife play, and many parts gunplay, and well, you have one heck of an arsenal to get invested into.-And many of these movements have such rawness to it, a destructive bout of shots and editing to really give you everything action junkies want in a movie with such a hardened lead.-This is where the sound and cinema work the most. Not in the beautiful shots of emotional wellness, or the beautiful backdrop, and backdrops. .
-No, instead this time it's about pulling together and bringing the pure spectacle of elite ops vs. The world, and it accomplishes it in that Statham glory.The Emotional Fulfillment
-There are those movies that know how to deliver that shot and moment that just screams full satisfaction.-To my surprise, the Beekeeper accomplished this for me, several of those moments captured in the perfect shot as the Statham gets that hit or kill that just makes you nod.-It adds a little more to the violence, gives some depth to his character without words, and helps to give this movie just that bit of depth that other films in this franchise lose when it's all about mediocre presentation.The Music
-A nice little mix of genres, the music has some comedic aspects and energy as Clay journeys on his quest for vengeance.-One part is song you will know, a blend of a lot of tracks that match the dynamic of the scene. While the other part is a typical Hollywood soundtrack of powerful instruments in the background to add that small oomph to the symphony of sound effects.DISLIKES:The Plot
-It's nothing special and quite linear, good on many levels, but will get lost in the sea of action films that we have.-There is little diving into most characters, it's quite lacking in terms of unique fervor, and the extra information just doesn't have the delivery that much of the John Wick series does.-It's not what most are going for, but... given some of the legendary actions films have a bit more meat to their, I can't say I wasn't disappointed not to have more to the story.It's Sort Of Ridiculous
-To an extent, all action movies are ridiculous.-But in this film, the movie's stunts are sometimes a bit too silly and extreme to not laugh and lose the respect and focus I had in the first part of the film.-Throw in the unbalanced strength factors in this movie being quite wider than I like to see and the movie just breaches a story that sort of lacks that organization I like to see in movies like these that have that balance of comic awesomeness and reality edge.Excessive Language
-By this point I've become desensitized, but the language is annoying at times to the point that again, there are better phrases and words to use.-The F and MF terminology is their bread and butter of the movie, so if you have a sensitivity for these words, avoid this movie at all costs or be ready expletive city.-It's lazy writing at times, but it sells, and at times they nail the timing and make it worthwhile.Some Violence Hard To Watch
-There are many moments that desensitized people like me can handle with no issues and laughing at the pure bliss of excitement.-And then there are some moments that are going to be hard, cringeworthy stabs, carving, and a few other means that are going to be hard to watch.-Though it doesn't hit the levels of Hostel or Saw, it may still be something to be wary of given some of the finishing moves Statham brings with it.An Element Of Action.-Mainly a lot of invincibility/superman complexes for much of the movie that can lead it to be a bit boring.-Wick, Olympus has Fallen, James Bond, and more take hits and come close to taking hits, which adds excitement, fun, and that danger sense.-The BeeKeeper though doesn't do this much of the movie, meaning the spectacle and finishes carry the excitement rather than the threat to our antihero. Had they cleaned that up a bit, it might have added even more to the mix.The VERDICT:
The BeeKeeper is a smash hit when it comes to the mindless action and fun of watching a one man army take out the bad guys. Very fast, very exciting, and holding enough merit to build a foundation that will give a meaning to the chaos and violence you are watching. Comedy helps add some pizazz to the mix, a little relief to the darker undertones that go well with the action. Add in the sense of justice and some engaging action that really helps this movie thrive and excel in the promised entertainment the trailers sent in their advertising. And with the simplicity comes the limitations of story, the stupid antics that are hyperbolic feats of super human levels, and some rather one sided antics that can be a bit stale. Throw in some hyper language use and some hard to watch moments, and you round out this movie to some Statham fun that is familiar, a tad stale, and dare I say a bit too familiar to be unique and engaging. Still, this one is worth a trip to the theater for just the fun times, and definitely one worth watching at home.My scores:

",Rich-Lee-Bailey,09-Feb-24,"I'll watch any movie with Jason Statham in it, and I am more than likely always going to enjoy it. The film does have that whole John Wick vibe, like, you don't mess with John Wick, and the same goes for the beekeeper.I do miss the good old real kick-ass Statham has delivered previously in his transporter films. The film could have showcased more of Statham's impressive fighting skills, which would have been a great addition.I enjoy a good action film like this now and then. It's not cinema material, but not many films are these days.The girl playing the FBI agent whose mum got killed in the beginning has no acting abilities whatsoever. She sucks just as badly in this as she does in the umbrella academy. Something about her is annoying, but I can't pinpoint it.","

The Beekeper," UnBEElievably Good
",GenghisKhan69,19-Jan-24,"If you are looking for a fun, fast-paced, and furious action movie, you might want to check out The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham as a former special agent who becomes a vigilante after his friend is scammed by a ruthless tech mogul. The movie is directed by David Ayer, who knows how to deliver explosive set pieces and gritty violence, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who adds some clever twists and witty dialogue to the formulaic plot.The movie is essentially a showcase for Statham's charisma and skills, as he plays a man who lives a quiet life as a beekeeper in the countryside, until his friend and mentor falls victim to a phishing scheme that drains her life savings. Here Jason Stathams character then embarks on a mission to track down and punish the culprits responisble leading to a hive of concpiracies and plot twists.The movie does not take itself too seriously, and neither should the audience. The plot is full of holes and implausibilities, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the dialogue is often cheesy and clichéd. However, the movie also has a sense of humor and self-awareness, and does not shy away from poking fun at its own absurdity and genre conventions. The movie also delivers on the action front, with plenty of shootouts, chases, fights, and explosions, all staged with flair and energy by David Ayer.Statham is in his element, as he dispatches his enemies with style and efficiency, while also displaying some emotional range and vulnerability in certain scenes. The supporting cast is also solid, with Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson hamming it up as the villains, and various supporting casts adding some warmth and depth to the story.The movie is not without its flaws, and it is certainly not for everyone. Some viewers might find it too violent, too silly, or too predictable. However, for fans of Statham and action movies in general, The Beekeeper is a satisfying and entertaining ride that will keep you buzzing for 90 minutes. It is the best kind of bad movie, one that knows what it is and what it wants to be, and delivers on its promise. The Beekeeper is a honey of an action movie, and you might want to give it a try.","

Otherwise we will bring them to Justice; and take over the country until the UDHR has been manifested.The same applies to Israel, namely the oppressive Netanyahu regime; Netanyahu being responsible for the incitement that led to PM Yitzhak Rabin's 1995 assassination and sabotaging Peace Talks.

The Beekeper," As expected, movie packed with loads/tons of action
",antoniotierno,13-Jan-24,"When Statham's tranquil life-in-retirement is shattered by the death-by-suicide, we start expectedly seeing the usual Jason's character. So he switches into vengeance mode. With beatings, explosions, gunplay and more. It's what happens in a Jason Statham movie. We're talking about genuine crowd-pleaser, action like in a live-action cartoon. No shades of gray here. There is obviously the risk of the whole thing getting and turning into a big cliché, leaving the sensation of a deja-vue. Bit going to much such a movie results in the risk of having to watch such a story, which is properly packed, on the whole.","

The Beekeper," Awesome Bee movie
",GreatorexLee,17-Jan-24,"A a really, really fun film. What I love about The Beekeeper is it feels like a genuine classic action b-movie. The odd dialogue and clunky changes in tone never feel forced or like satire of classic action b-movies. Instead it's a genuinely idiosyncratic movie that provides possibly unintentional comedy along with some great action scenes.I had so much fun watching this and will definitely be buying the DVD when it's out. The perfect movie to watch with a few beers. Some classic clunky social commentary just like many of the second tier action movies of the 80s and 90s. Some fantastic villains too although I would have loved to have seen much more of at least two of them.Good cast! Josh Hutcherson is great in this whilst Jeremy Irons and Minnie Driver are essentially pointless but add character to this strange but highly enjoyable movie.","

Still , i loved some absurd ways some died.The Overall revange story was original, but i wish it would have been more critical of the world of USA politics and a better scripted ending.I guaranty a 99 % follow up to the Beekeeper as a cash action movie serial.

The Beekeper," Tired Ground, But Still Fun
",statuskuo,13-Jan-24,"I dunno, for me, the revenge plot will never get old. In this case Jason Statham plays a dude who gets triggered into action when the only lady who looked out for him gets offed and he goes into action. Have you ever noticed that these revenge films seem to take on an air of horror movies sometimes. Like baddies are sliced and diced away in horrific ways. The hero in this case, seems to be a supernatural entity that can't be killed.The term ""beekeeper"" in this sense means a few things. And writer Kurt Wimmer taps into the mentality of a bee hive. Suppose he got into a hobby and decided to draw parallels between the two. It gets absurd people.Director David Ayer has drawn a ton of fire for some mis-steps in the DC world, but in this world he works well. Everyone will compare this to John Wick. Which...I understand the framework looks similar but this is, to me, closer to ""The Equalizer"".The problem is that we know very little about the relationship between him and the catalyst for his vengeance. It's not catastrophic that he goes into action (a suicide). The ire falls on a party kid who is related to very powerful person. The issue is that his money is also the basis of how this powerful person got to where they are. Yes, the absurdity of the plot is very dumb. But, it's also not that serious.Statham is being pursued by the daughter of the woman who killed herself. Who also happens to be an FBI agent. Keep in mind, her Mother just committed suicide, and she's cracking wise with her partner. Fun as that may seem, it does feel odd.That said...who cares? It's silly. I mean, Jeremy Iron plays a former head of the CIA. He knows he's collecting a paycheck. As is Minnie Driver. And so forth. They know how camp this has to be.BUT, it's not campy enough. In my opinion, it needed to go full cartoon. And they try, with one last villain at the end who looks like a Street Fighter reject.This movie is wildly dumb but also...does have that so-dumb-it's fun.Turn your brain off and enjoy. Statham just likes wrecking havoc, busting chops and dispensing with comical bad guys in gruesome ways.","

",endrits,14-Feb-24,"Expect Statham, who has the usual role, and he knows how to play it by heart, almost all the other part of the acting crew doesn't know how to act. I do not know if this is the new normal, as I've seen a lot of this kind of poor acting in the recent years, but in my opinion, actors put little to no effort on the play. This is the case even for this movie. The screenplay seems to focus more on action and violence, leaving no space and time for things that would be normal in the logic of the movie, like the human relationship and sentiments, like the feelings of a daughter for her dead mom, or no positive feelings for the helping guy. All in all, you can laugh 2-3 times, but really, not any kind of emotion during or after watching this. Anyway it's watchable if you don't mind for the acting level.","

The Beekeper," Provocative Thrills
",JoshuaMercott,18-Feb-24,"As heart-racing as it was entertaining, ""The Beekeeper"" saw Jason Statham once again delivering a high-octane action-hero performance that was memorable, thrilling, and suspenseful. He still has the ability to make the implausible feel credible.Statham played the role of a retired top-tier secret agent named Adam Clay who worked for a covert organization called The Beekeepers; from where the movie got its name. When someone he respected was harmed, Adam chose vengeance over forgiveness, and went to town on the individuals responsible.Though the story was anything but original, I loved how they put on quite the show and communicated a potent message about the strong protecting the weak. I liked the script's simple yet impactful approach. The story also showcased the negative near-unstoppable power malware still poses on our pro-tech society.Phishing was what led Adam on his path of vengeance after his kind-hearted friend and lessor Eloise was swindled by a shady company whose scams were linked to a bigger political game. After losing everything, Eloise had little choice but to commit suicide.So much of this is happening even today, making this theme in ""The Beekeeper"" supremely relevant. Heartless phishing is taking place all over the world and the idea lent this movie a wake-up-call vibe that I appreciated.Special shout-out to Eloise Parker (played by Phylicia Rashad), David Witts (as Mickey Garnett), Emmy Raver-Lampman (as Agent Verona Parker), Bobby Naderi (as Agent Matt Wiley), Josh Hutcherson (as Derek Danforth), Jeremy Irons (as Wallace Westwyld), Minnie Driver (as Director Janet Harward), and Jemma Redgrave (as POTUS Danforth).Though some of the tropes and dialogues in the movie were a tad aggrandized, in favour of the titular Beekeeper, the story managed to inform and entertain nonetheless. The team also cleverly wove in a few ""John Wick"" bounty elements, which stood well within the plot's parameters.The way the team connected scammers to corporations and government big-wigs was interesting, to say the least. They took theories that have been making the rounds for years and gave them an action-thriller twist with Statham at the helm.If only the world had real-life Adam Clays helping safeguard the 'hive'. Alas, such exemplary heroism seems only to exist in movies. ""The Beekeeper"" was one such story, and it was equally evocative and provocative.A sequel sounds like a buzzing good idea.","

""Matrix, what have you left for us?

Cut her character out of the plot - nothing would change, she doesn't participate in its development at all.Bottom line, if you somewhere near 40, Sly and Arny were your idols in childhood, and muscular men with a minimum of dialog, but a huge charisma warm your heart - it's safe to watch, especially skipping characters - fillers.","

There, if you know Jason Statham, I've given you all the knowledge you need for this movie and you can stop reading now. For those of you who might need a little more information, the rest is for you. This is an action movie that is the most accurate depiction of ""It's so bad it's good"". It's about Adam Clay (Jason Statham), who is retired from his job and is now beekeeping for Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), who is letting him stay in the barn. Eloise gets targeted by a phishing scam that robs all of her money. After tragedy strikes, Adam goes on a revenge rampage following the money trail, using his specific set of skills as a ""beekeeper"". It's very rare when I can safely say that I loved and hated this experience. The script is horrible, but hilarious. The antagonists are cartoony, but hilarious. The violent action is great. The non-stop bee puns are fantastic, but not for everyone. The supporting cast is actually good, involving a unique role for Josh Hutcherson, Jeremy Irons, even Minnie Driver for some reason. I enjoyed how similar it is to JOHN WICK. He's just trying to ""protect the hive"". Phishing scams are still very prevalent in today's society, and this movie is a reminder to always be careful online, unless you're friends with Jason Statham. He had a bad year last year with THE MEG 2 and THE EXPENDABLES 4, but this is definitely his niche. We just need to not take his movies seriously. If you see THE BEEKEEPER, just shut down your brain for a couple hours and enjoy the ride. I highly recommend this!","

Films are meant to bring emotion, and I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in the cinema gave a little virtual fist pump as each odious baddie got their comeuppance.I titled this as 'much better than I expected' because the trailer came across like some sort of parody action film, yes the bee reference is a little comical at times but I think it fits, and overall if action is your thing like John Wick you'll leave the cinema with a sile on your face.","

Statham's performance, though never in a scene for extended amounts of time with any one actor save the agent, elevates all their performances for the story. Speaking of the story/mythology, it's as good or better than a certain franchise (looking at you Wick) and yet it probably won't see the endless number of sequels, if it even gets one.

The Beekeper," Comes across as an old-fashioned action film, but the messy story makes it sometimes difficult to BEE followed.
",movieman6-413-929510,14-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper is a new action thriller film from David Ayer, director of Fury and Suicide Squad.Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a retired special agent of the secret organization called The Beekeepers. During his retirement, he rents a place to keep bees from old Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad).When Eloise is scammed online, she loses all her money and discovers her life. As a result, Adam goes after the online organization in revenge to stop them before they manage to scam other elderly people. Because of this revenge, Adam himself becomes a target of the FBI and he gets Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman) Eloise, her daughter, after him.With this action film they seem to be playing on the lame, entertaining action films from the 80s and 90s. Action actors like Sylvester Stallone's Arnold Schwarzenegger have to do exaggerated things to make someone blush, while making a silly joke. Furthermore, the film also plays on concepts from more modern action films such as John Wick where there are hidden organizations with special rules for mutual special agents.Despite these familiar aspects for fans of previous action films, the story of this film remains a bit rushed and bundled. Apart from the exaggerated, lame action parts, the film itself is sometimes a bit difficult to keep up with. If the writer had focused a little more on the imaginary story and used a little less different characters in the film, it could have been a little easier to follow. The message about the bad sides of scamming people online or with fake calls is somewhat lost.The effects don't always come across either. Some flames and explosions are not always clear, because the CGI is so clearly visible. Sometimes you can also see where they use pupae after the beekeeper ends his strong with his opponents.Jason Statham once again delivers suitable acting in the leading role of this action film. This is already the fifth action film he has made in a row in recent times. The rest of the film cast also delivers suitable work, but due to the more selected sides, most of them get few opportunities to really do something with their characters in the film.","

The Beekeper," Great action and great entertainment
",edmond_melkomian,21-Jan-24,"I loved this movie. A vigilante taking revenge on the unscrupulous people who take advantage of senior citizens who have no knowledge of computers and combine that with shady political characters. Jason Statham shines in this movie. There isn't much dialogue, the line where he breaks into building and counts 1-2-3 for the security guard was a classic. The fighting and the fight scenes were really good. On the only negative side was that he got rid of the new beekeeper quickly and I also hope when they shot up the bee hives, they didn't actually destroy any. Overall a fun movie to watch and great action.","

The Beekeper," Give the fire fighters a break.
",AfricanBro,20-Jan-24,"The opening title sequence sets an intense and epic vibe, almost like a dark psychological thriller. This is an instant classic, instant! It's like if John Wick was the equalizer, but it's Jason Statham, who happens to have a fascination with bees and bee analogies. While I recently haven't watched Statham's best movies, this one compelled me to label it as some of his best work yet. But that's probably the adrenaline speaking. The fight scenes were both cool and intimidating, often laced with moments of humor as Statham toyed with his adversaries.The story was just okay, nothing spectacular even though the big bad was essentially the biggest big-bad; but to be honest the story's just a bonus, it's like a favor from the writers because the whole movie is really just Jason Statham engaging in relentless action, whooping butt. I think this is the first action movie of this sort I've enjoyed this much since the first two equalizer films with Denzel Washington.Now, my primary gripe lies in the lack of truly formidable antagonists-except for the Afrikaans dude, most of the villains felt rather lackluster in posing a challenge to Mr. Cray. A touch of additional villainous depth could have heightened the movie's tension. Bad guys could've been more bad ass. I always knew Mr cray was gonna win the next fight, it never felt like the stakes were high.Jason Statham undoubtedly shines as one of the finest action stars, showcasing his prowess in this film. Fifth movie in a year. I love how even though there's a few funny bits, they're not inherently comical; the main character has serious, no-nonsense demeanor, maintaining a dark and brutal persona throughout. The film wisely refrains from diluting this intensity with unnecessary jokes or lightheartedness. While not flawless-some minor issues with dialogue and acting in non-action segments-I highly recommend if you're an action fan. But even if you're not, because my sister had a blast with this too.Also there are no credit scenes, I googled but a couple websites seem to have it mixed up with Aquaman credit scene.","

The Beekeper," Not much a buzz around this film.
",jonwade,31-Jan-24,I enjoyed Beekeeper - the same way you enjoy a 1980's straight to video action flick. In places it was unintentionally hilarious.The accents of what seemed to be the mostly British cast were fantastic - American one moment - English the next - with Jeremy Irons appearing to be the first Brit ex head of the CIA before taking a stab at an American drawl later on in the movie.The fight scenes were good - the twisteroo with the bad guys mum was good.But the absolute pinnacle was the South African hit man Lazerous. Wonderful stuff - chewing the scenery from second one. The Stath had no problem identifying Lazerous' team in a crowded building as they were all dressed like extras in an MC Hammer video.Did enjoy it - had a good laugh - but it is not great.,"

The Beekeper," kind of creative
",talllwoood13,06-Feb-24,"I saw this movie the other day and there were parts of it that were really well directed or written, however that ending was just poorly done. The casting was all over the place, it's like they had to find a balance between ""woke"" and hipster like casting. I hate the hairstyle that someone had to have agreed upon for ""Verona Parker"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Then of course the other bee keeper Jason Statham fights in the gas station just made me cringe. Just another person trying hard to embrace the 1980s style and culture but probably didn't grow up in it with her awful haircut, the jacket and anything else just made it look like they were trying too hard. However that was one of the best scenes in the movie without any doubt. In the call centers I would have rather Jason fly to ""South Asia"" and do all the destruction that he does over there as we all know where most of those scams are coming from! However language barriers and all that would be a bit difficult. Instead Jason barely drives across America. Maybe a state or two maximum and he just beats up or murders hipsters for the most part. Sure there are actual soldiers and everything but those call centers are mostly hipsters who the only time they have probably ever seen a firearm was playing Call Of Duty while they ate Doritos and drank Mountain Dew to be ""ironic"".The bad guys plot was horrible, we didn't need the 28 year old. However he played his role well to be that unlikable. I do feel Jeremy Irons should have been the actual bad guy instead. The worst thing that hipster looking kid probably did was forgetting to tip a waiter I'd look at him as. The second the movie got to the second call center it REALLY went downhill. Finally revealing how the mother got where she was and trying to link all these silly things together. It's like the movie ""The Painter"" which came out recently where the movie was good but the endings were awful. I even sat through until the end of the credits hoping we'd get a bit more but nope!The final fight was well done, it wasn't a one sided Steven Seagal fight. The fact that Jason was fighting against men he didn't intend to kill and shooting them in the body armor to knock them out was good. They even tried to implement bee facts in the movie as besides that the most we had was Jason tossing a jar of honey at someone. They had a few creative kills as well in this. I loved the bridge scene the most or when they are in the barn.The current rating of 6.5 is a perfect rating for this. It had a ton of potential to become a better movie but a different director and work on the script may have improved it. Who knows maybe in 2034 or 2044 there will be a remake. They've made them for lesser movies.","

The Beekeper," No Frills Action, Statham Doing What He Does Best
",Shaunmatthewc,17-Jan-24,"I really enjoyed this, I can't lie. Coming as an 80s action fan and following Statham's career since the early days of Snatch and the first Transporter film. His character in this befriends an old lady who falls for a phishing scam and kills herself.Then it's up to him to take revenge on everyone responsible with some of the most over the top ""Punisher like"" kills ever seen. There's something righteous about seeing these horrible people get their comeuppance which doesn't happen as much in real life unfortunately. Everyone in this acts well, the over the top Kiwi henchmen who pops up was hilarious.Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a good job as a couple of slimy villains. Emmy Raver-Lampman from Umbrella Academy is decent enough as an FBI agent trying to stop The Beekeeper. If you like old school action and don't need to be pummeled over the head with virtue signalling or any other messaging I would definitely recommend this. It's nice to see Statham bounce back with Meg 2 and this film after the abysmal Expendables 4.","

The Beekeper," An insight into how this movie was made
",josejmaacc,03-Feb-24,"A previous writer for Fast-X is intolerant to spices, however he went to an Indian restaurant and then to a Mexican restaurant, between all the vomiting and diahrea he wrote this movie script. After that he invited the producer and director, they live far far away and traveled in a plane that leaked lead from enriched lead fuel into the cabin, with the same brain capacity as an amoeba they evaluated the script and opinated about its greatness. The same plane was used in all the camera operators, stunt actors, advisors, everyone , everyone was using that plane all the time.When the camera man is filming Jason and include 20 other fighters 1 meter away fromhim that are doing nothing, well, remember the fumes.I would like to points out that I can not explain the consistency between scenes but I think the diahrea is very very similiar.","

Minnie Driver is pointlessly wasted in a role with about a minute of screentime while the cop Verona who supposedly to be grieved for her mother's death instead runs around Statham is a pointless and a major drawback...The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing for powerful fighting scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Statham once again proves why he's the go-to guy for heart-pounding action. A must-watch for fans of intense storytelling and jaw-dropping combat sequences...","

The Beekeper," Ridiculous, silly, and entertaining
",darkreignn,14-Jan-24,"I am not a fan of David Ayer, but I am a fan of Jason Statham, and so - also being inspired by the positive reviews - I decided to drag my dad to the theatre with me to watch this movie. And on one hand, I enjoyed it as a Statham action vehicle; on the other hand, this film is chock-full of virtually every single David Ayer cliche that you can imagine.Is there near-constant cussing in this movie because of script writing that would make middle school students blush? Yes, there is. Are there a large number of ridiculous looking and absurdly dressed characters that you cannot envision being in anything other than an Ayer picture? Oh, you better believe it. And is there over-the-top violence that has absolutely no business being portrayed as anything that would remotely even take place in the realm of reality? Of course! It's all standard Ayer fare, and while I am not too much of a proponent of that, I found ""The Beekeeper"" to be as entertaining as it was thanks, in part, to those creative decisions.As much as I would've appreciated a more straightforward, grounded take on the action genre, I'd be lying if I said that the ludicrousness of it all wasn't entertaining, because it was. From the constant bee puns and the hilariously energetic villains that would give Jordan Belfort a run for his money to Statham's stoic and almost inhuman performance and all of the horror villain-esque violence that he delivers upon his enemies, ""The Beekeeper"" is straight-laced farce. This is a movie that's dumb, and knows that it's dumb, but plays itself as serious as humanly possible. Because of that, you'll find yourself laughing with the movie while also finding a great deal to enjoy from the action sequences.""The Beekeeper"" features Statham at his most brutal, perhaps ever, employing a range of tactics that dispatch the film's villains in increasingly violent manners. Statham is a force to be reckoned with here, more akin to The Punisher than John Wick, and it really works. It's all very silly, but the brutality is fitting, especially since the villains are so despicable. You really want to see the villains get what's coming to them, and you get that through a series of action sequences that are each more elaborate than the next. I cannot emphasize enough how stupid the movie is, but I also can't emphasize enough how fun it is to watch on the silver screen.I am still not a fan of David Ayer after watching this movie, but I am impressed about how entertaining ""The Beekeeper"" managed to be. As I said, I would've preferred a more gritty, serious action movie than this was, but for what it was, this was fun, and I will definitely be adding this to my physical media collection.","

I have to also state that had the actors not nailed the intimate moments, it would not have worked. I will also write that I would have enjoyed more screen time for Ms. Rashad and Jason. Casting everyone's perfect mom was wonderful. I wanted more. Further, the motivating factors were not developed, more of a - here eat this - kinda thing. I'd of enjoyed more backstory that may have informed her character's actions. Stunts were awesome, great choreography and acting overall. One guy played his personality disorder versus being, but it didn't interfere to much. I thought he missed a great opportunity. Looking forward to Beekeeper 2!","

",barefootstallion,30-Jan-24,"It was typical Jason Statham fight fare, but it was a lot of fun - it always fun to get to see him reprise his more notable roles like Frank Martin in The Transporter and Lee Christmas in The Expendables.It's a story about a retired special agent from a black-ops organization hitting the revenge trail after some scammers steal everything from the person who was ""the only person who took care of him"" - which led to this friend tragically taking their own life.It was nowhere near as deep or as good as say, The Accountant, it dipping rather blatantly and somewhat shallowly into the contempt we all feel for scammers to fuel its plot, but it was still an enjoyable watch.In other words, while it wasn't very gripping or anything, it is still, always fun to watch Jason Statham be, well, Jason Statham.In summary, this is a movie with which you just get to turn your mind off, munch on some popcorn and just have fun watching it.","

The Beekeper," He's a Beekeeper.
",KFstudios2009,31-Jan-24,"I had high expectations for this movie, and in the end, this was just a normal action flick for a one time watch, nothing special that you are getting. I really liked the main character, the beekeeper, Adam Clay, that was performed by Jason Statham. I will tell about the performance first. Statham was very cool in his role, he put humor into the beekeeper and the personality he had was really well adapted by him. The badass face, dialogues and outfit made him a really dangerous keeper of bees. From the story side, I think the beekeeper agency concept was very cool, and the main character had a motive and good reason to kill so many people. I liked the metaphor about the hive, how the society system can be compared to it, and that sometimes, you just have to kill the bee queen (Watch the film to understand that part). The main antagonists, a group of rich hacker-scammers, were good enough for the role as the menacing bad guys. I just wished that The Boss for the bad guys could have a better backstory and have some more space in the film, make him more important, more concerned about the beekeeper, just something to make him better. The story had a good flow, yet it was very generic. The introduction for the beekeeper agency and the scammers in the beginning was cool, but later, they got out for ideas and just went into action. The thing is, I wished more plot, more that could happen, not only fighting. Anyways, a few action sequences were great and enjoyable, while others felt messy and unorganized (Something I have noticed in many action movies recently). The final act did build up a good suspense to the final point, and the ending was cool and it finished well. The acting was mostly carried by the badass Jason Statham, and the rest was mediocre and on a very low scale. You know how it is in an action movie, the main character is out for hunting, while there is always that one person that follows him? Well, there was something in here, too. A CiA agent that thinks the beekeeper had good intentions for killing, but she wants to stop him before he have killed to many. And she was kind of unnecessary when I think about it. She had a connection in the story, but this could work easily without her and they could put more story instead. She wasn't performed that well, too. Summarizing, The Beekeeper was an ok action flick that could have been much better, and if you like badass killers and actors like Vin Diesel, Jason Statham or Sylvester Stallone, this one is just for you.","

The Beekeper," More of a streaming action flick
",moviemanmo,17-Jan-24,"The title sequence was interesting with its bee and beekeeper related images.Phylicia Rashad playing the role of Eloise was believable as an elderly woman who is not privy to how online scams work. Unfortunately her screen time is very minimal as the filmmakers decided to kill their best actress.Jason Statham's motives for seeking revenge are very cliche. Although I didn't mind it, it could have been improved by further developing his relationship with Phylicia Rashad's character. Instead he literally just states that no one has ever taken care of him besides her.Emmy Raver-Lampman plays the role of Agent Verona Parker who happens to be the daughter of Eloise. She is so poorly written as a character and its immediately apparent the moment the audience is introduced to her. First she finds her mother dead and she didn't gasp or weep a single tear. Later on her family home that's supposed to have so many memories is burned to the ground and once again she is just stone cold like if it's nothing. Her dialogue is also weak and filled with lines that are laughable and poorly delivered.David Witts who plays the role of Mickey Garnett. He is the scammer that causes Eloise to commit suicide and while he was scamming her I enjoyed his character. He was playing the role well and felt like a true villain. However, once he is in contact with Jason Statham his character makes a switch and the performance is not good. Just like Agent Parker his dialogue and character are weak.Jeremy Irons who plays the character Wallace was okay. I did enjoy his explanation of what it meant to be a beekeeper and how Jason Statham's character played a role in the organization.Josh Hutcherson's character would have been better if he was more assertive and not babied. Lazarus was another character that would have been better if he had a serious tone. Instead he was used as a form of comedic relief but it was laughable in a bad cheesy way.As far as the action goes this film doesn't deliver anything new. The elevator scene is probably the only thing that stands out and the scene where Garnett is strapped to the pickup truck is a bit funny. The gas station scene is only memorable because of how it's horribly done. The special effects are not really good and could have been improved.The story was a bit intriguing which kept this from being boring. The pacing was rather quick and the film does fly straight to its conclusion. Not a great movie by any means but it can kill 2hrs if need be.","

The Beekeper," You get exactly what you expect from a Jason Staham action movie
",MovieWarfare,11-Feb-24,"I came for a fun action movie starring Jason Statham and got exactly that. It is an inferior John Wick movie with an elderly dying of a scam instead of a dog.The big problem this movie has is its terrible writing and dialogue. It is filled with countless Bee puns and one-liners that don't land. The characters are forgettable and one-dimensional. The villain is very cartoony compared to every other character. There is a person sent to kill our main character halfway through the film that feels like they are from a completely different movie.However, you are here for the action scenes and they are very fun to watch with their great choreography. In the end, that is what most people are watching this for and it delivers.","

The Beekeper," All Buzz, No Honey!
",matthewheneghan,04-Feb-24,"This film grapples with self identity originating from its initial frame. In the opening sequences of the movie the pacing attempts to have you believe that this film will be a broody Statham slaughter extravaganza, in line with others of his repertoire.However, the film soon falls victim to juvenile expositions and shallow, one dimensional characters. Perhaps the worst of them being a brash, young FBI agent Verona Parker. Each time she was featured on screen I couldn't help but feel that the dialogue was penned by high-school students working on a group project.The action sequences are passable, yet nothing inspired or memorable.Overall this movie fails to live up to its fun, adrenaline fuelled thrill-ride its marketed to be.The beekeeper fails to deliver any sweet nuance of action packed fun. For me, this movie is a hard pass. Maybe wait for streaming if you're eager to watch this movie.","

The Beekeper," Oh boy...
",stonedesign-35565,31-Jan-24,"Not sure how some people have rated this movie above 2 stars. I couldn't get over how bad the acting is. I've always liked Jason Statham but the supporting cast were pretty awful. It reminds me of the straight to DVD film that you'd watch with your friends after a few drinks, and try to make it through the whole movie without turning it off. God awful script written by someone who shouldn't be writing scripts. I usually love a good action film and the only reason I've given this film 2 stars is for Jason Statham and some of the semi-decent fight scenes. I can normally ignore the cheese factor in films/TV shows, but this one takes the biscuit. Avoid.","

The Beekeper," Buzzing with brutality and a bit of stinging social commentary
",steveinadelaide,15-Jan-24,"The Beekeeper is not another typical sugary action film. It is a brutal revenge story characterised by biting social commentary and violent fights. The lead role of Adam Clay, a former operative in the secret dark government organisation called Beekeepers, is played by Jason Statham, who wears the beekeeper's hat. Adam has been left without his only friend, who was scammed online. He decides to sting the corrupt corporation that stole away his dear friend, leaving behind maimed bodies and broken secrets.David Ayer, director of macho war movies, has brought the same level of intensity to The Beekeeper. Fights between combatants are raw, with Statham as usual in his signature balletic violence. He acts like a beekeeper, protecting the hive, dealing with thugs, and methodically beating them down one by one; all of these blows hurt the system he opposes.The Beekeeper is not all fists and fights (well, not quite). Surprisingly, it weaves a complex web of themes. This means that its objective is to focus on unmasking the evils of corporate greed and their effects on people. However, Adam's fascination with bees shows how society interacts with everyone, for even little things can cause massive changes.Emmy Raver-Lampman as Adam's friend's estranged daughter and an FBI agent, and Jeremy Irons playing a chillingly charismatic CEO, give impressive performances among others who make up this cast. Raver-Lampman brings some much-needed emotional depth, while Irons drips wickedness out of every word spoken through his unique style.However, at times, this film fails to live up to its own ambitions. The story line, despite being captivating, tends to be somewhat predictable at times, while the pacing occasionally becomes clumsy, going from one action sequence to another without providing much scope for thematic exploration. Moreover, dialogue sometimes becomes clichéd, especially when too many bee-related puns come into play.However, The Beekeeper has enough energy to keep your attention. This is a movie that is not scared of getting its hands dirty in either the literal or metaphorical sense. It's a brutal bee sting of a film that makes you itch to fight for what is right, even when stung in the process.So, should you watch The Beekeeper? If you are just looking for senseless action, this one may not be for you. If you fancy violent movies that have an absurd plot yet still employ social commentary, then perhaps it may be worth your time to go and see it. Just remember, it's a Jason Statham action movie. If you've seen one before, you'll know what to expect!","

",cahidi,14-Feb-24,"Jason Statham, his name alone guarantees a minimum of 5 star rating on an action movie. So with that in mind, this movie is obviously a must see for all action movie junkie. Every action movies which he starred in always keeps the audiences nailed to their seats. Regardless of their plots, the action sequences alone have that kind of effect. So I don't need to review on the action part anymore. Plot wise, there's nothing new with this movie. It's all straight forward. Meet the hero, meet the bad guy, the bad guy wronged the hero, the hero punish the bad guy. Boom. Simple and effective. Leave very little to the imagination.

The Beekeper," Another generic uninspired action movie.
",VOIIIXI,02-Feb-24,"The issues with this movie are pretty obvious really, we've seen it all before in similar generic dumb action movies. The tireless constant exposition throughout the movie, the cringy dialogue, the over the top plot and characters, the ""secret government controls the world and they're also very bad"" thing, the constant dramatic music over every scene, the bad guy taking a long time to shoot or doesn't and then something happens, the fight scenes where there are 10 or 20 people around him but they decide to attack one at a time, and of course none of them can pull their gun fast enough or have it ready, and either not shoot or if they shoot they won't hit him of course, just all the stupid crap that we've seen before, uninspired unimaginative director doing the same things to make some money. Not surprised coming from the director of the Oscar winning critically acclaimed movie ""SUICIDE SQUAD"" hahahaha.One of my biggest issues with the movie is how throughout the whole movie until the last 10 minutes, that female cop wants to catch Jason Statham's character so badly, who's avenging her mother who got scammed and committed suicide because of it, and destroying call centers that harm thousands and millions of other people, why is she so mad that he's doing what he's doing, it's very odd, and it makes me despise that character so badly. Oh yeah ""she took an oath"" like stfu.All she did was make dumb jokes with her unfunny partner literally hours and days after her mother died, she's handled her mother's death as if her goldfish died. And she's always dressed like she's going to a night club or going to the mall with her friends, not like an FBI agent. There's a scene where she was literally walking around with a Harvard t-shirt, a police jacket and ripped pants. Another scene she's wearing this suit, but instead of a tie, there's this big stupid button/necklace that has a woman's painting or picture on it, and also wearing capri pants and big black boots. She is always dressed inappropriately in every scene, like she wants to look like a cool and quirky FBI agent so badly, this doesn't make her cool, just very obnoxious and unprofessional looking. Terrible character, and the actress is also terribly miscast for that terrible role. No personality or charisma at all.The positives of the movie are of course Jason Statham, he's one of the best in the business and extremely charismatic, and this goes without saying, it's the reason why me and everyone else wanted to watch this movie. I would watch him in anything, and they really should cast him in more and better roles. That's about all the positives about it. I mainly wanted to write this review to share my hatred towards that female cop character.","

The Beekeper," As an action movie there are few better.
",notifynow,11-Feb-24,"Statham is consistently the badass and here it's no different but in this movie there is a depth to the characterization seldom seen in action movies. There are some comedic moments that are so unexpected they just slay here. Not many but where they are they're so effective and break up the tension in remarkable ways. The directing is really what sets this movie apart as the camera work is meticulous and you feel so ""right there"". The only detraction was Statham's seeming invincibility to highly trained combat trained specialists, often several against one. But this is typical for action movies so we can give that a pass. I only wish there was more time with Jeremy Irons. Hard to believe an actor of such stature would be involved in an action movie but he played his part at 110% as always.You know there are going to be sequels. Statham has a real winner here. The storyline is rather unique for action movies and is a definite keeper. You can bank on it. I just hope they go for a more realistic character because they can't get away with the invincible star and stay within the confines of reality again. Let's hope. This has so much promise.The profanity was unending and really detracted from the storyline as it was so unneeded and diluted the strength of the dialogue as it always does when writers seem to run out of words. Hopefully they'll hire a better writer in the future.","

The Beekeper," Much better than anticipated.....
",PerryAtTheMovies,13-Jan-24,"6.4/10 (Recommend)My first 2024 film of the year, and I will say that I wasn't disappointed that it was. As much as this film is like any other Jason Statham film it feels more solid overall. The story is much better than I anticipated. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. The story progresses well, but has room for shortfalls especially around the last third of the film. The acting is top-notch for what this type of action film is. It's weird seeing Josh Hutcherson in the role he's in, but he does manage to pull it off better than I thought. The fight scenes leave much to be desired at times. Yes, they're cool and have some awesome shots, but there's certain aspects that logic can't penetrate. Not just the hand to hand aspects, but also with the weapons being used and the people using them. Don't get me wrong. It's still entertaining, but when you start boiling down the logics it can ruin it a little bit. Some of the visuals related to explosions are a little wonky, but they aren't domineering. Overall, this is a really enjoyable film. It's one I would definitely watch again. The runtime is decent, but felt a little long by the time the conclusion came. The acting is good, the story is more exciting than expected, but the visuals and logics lack at times. In the end I would recommend this as a film to check out.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","

It's fun to hear his one-liners and watch him whip the bad guys.However, the action scenes are a major disappointment. Instead of him whipping three or four guys in a fight now he's beating ten guys up at a time. Worse yet, most of these guys are special forces types with extensive training yet they stand around like the kung fu gangs who stand mostly still waving their arms while the hero downs each gang member one at a time. Additionally, like the bad guys in Rambo movies they can't shoot straight.All in all the action scenes are very lame and forgettable.I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they're a hard core Statham fan.","

The characters were typically shallow, but did have interesting backstories. And the baddies were almost believable. Of course, there were oddities and plot holes. And the fight scenes were impressively over-the-top ridiculous. It is non-stop action with an occasional bit of dialogue to glue things together.

With previous hits like Law Abiding Citizen and Expen4bles, Wimmer knows how to keep his story tight and his fight scenes explosive.And The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham, is no exception. Almost everyone in this film, male and female is a bad-ass.Built around the premise that the only thing that might be worse than beating a puppy is scamming a senior, Statham wreaks almost 2 hours of havoc on those who have fatally wronged the people he cares about, all while almost never breaking a sweat. Though in that time he does break many noses, fingers, and ankles.United Data Group are the big money-making scammers, overseen by Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons). What exactly does UDC do? Well, you know how you're always warned NOT to click on unknown links? They're the company that sends you the unknown weblinks and attachments, infecting and hijacking your computer and draining your bank accounts.The Beekeepers is the code name for the secret elite force within a secret government agency who even the secret keepers know little about. But what they do know scares the crap out of them; Adam Clay (Statham) was the best of the Bees, one who never fails to protect the Hive. When those in goverment positions put out the word, for their own financial reasons, that Beekeeper Clay has gone rogue, they send a number of legit and illegitimate armies to take him down and, more importantly, shut him up quickly.But they didn't realize that Clay, who only wanted to retire to his quiet life of beekeeping and honeycombs, is still the A-team Bee. In fact, he's the single member of this Bee team, dispatching multiple teams of nasty buzzing hornets left and right, smoking out the people who make their massive fortunes stealing other people's money.There are times when the script gets a little bit ""Wick-y"" in that other Bees are sent to take out this particular Bee, for a fee. Think ""High Table"" but definitely not as classy. Agents Verona Parker and Matt Wiley (Emmy Raver-Lampman and Bobby Naderi) are cast as the duo who are determined to smoke out Clay, but will Parker do her job or do right by her mother?Once Clay starts to follow the money trail, he's busy kicking the hornet's nest, one that has been skillfully hidden in the shadowy eaves of those at the highest level of power.","

Im willing to go along with the action trope and as a recent convert to a Statham fan thanks to Guy Richie I'm reminded why I was not a fan originally. I like his performance but the quality of the storylines and directing are often a letdown.

The Beekeper," The Beekeper: 4.5 out of 5.
",freddyelmst,20-Jan-24,"The Beekeper: 4.5 out of 5.I'll watch anything Jason Statham is in. Yeah, I even enjoyed Expendables 4 (despite the obvious challenges covid created for it- so much green screen work😔) but The Beekeeper is well and truly a return to form.He plays a retired ""Beekeeper"" (some shadowy secret-secret-secret agent type thing) who actually does keep bees and is borderline obsessed with them. Anyway he has someone he cares about taken from him due to some nefarious scamming organisation with links to the government. Statham-mode kicks in and of course he goes on to attempt to avenge her death in an all out action extravaganza.Sure it's a pretty linear story - you know where it's going to ultimately end up - but the fun is in the journey. Many skulls were cracked along the way, and there was even a safety demonstration on how NOT to use a bandsaw.Directed by David Ayer (who made the underrated old-Arnie action flick Sabotage). Keep an eye out for a cameo by a T-800 Terminator Endoskeleton in the Beekeeper! 🙃The Beekeeper is a fun ride. Switch off the brain and enjoy!","

The Beekeper," a comedy where the one good joke is that you paid to watch this
",ryan-60325,23-Jan-24,"I went into this fully expecting to enjoy a bad movie. It is so, so much worse than that. Its two redeeming qualities are a ruthlessly unflattering portrayal of crypto bros and an embedded decent PSA about computer support scams. Everything else is just brutal, and it gets worse the farther it gets into the run time. My generous suspension of disbelief could not cope with the later action scenes. There are no exciting plans being executed (you know, the kind that would never work in practice but are fun to watch); it's all one guy going through the motions of the same forgettable fight scene over and over. Two throwaway ""getting in"" moments, at best. If anything in the story was supposed to be a twist, it had zero impact. The experience is kind of like watching someone else speedrun a video game on Very Easy mode, taking advantage of the fact that enemies despawn when not in camera view. The key mysterious organization is barely explained and conveniently waved away at the halfway mark, but not barely enough to avoid forming a really, really dumb outline.Doesn't lean into the cheesy bee thing enough to be hilariously terrible, although it's clear that they tried somewhat. In the end, it's just regular, boring terrible.",NA
The Beekeper," Too many hornets, not enough beekeepers
",xnicofingerx,06-Feb-24,"In the first few minutes, the viewer is served a massive enemy image. It works, kill 'em all! Old world versus new world, hard work versus fast money, decent versus unscrupulous. 25 minutes that do you good, good old politically incorrect action, the white knight fighting evil, the return of the avenger, by any means necessary. Then, unfortunately, a small or large CGI damper. Forget about it, it's onwards and upwards, no time to take a breather, no time to get angry, because the dark side doesn't give up so easily. It has now completely infiltrated the state apparatus, eating away at it, a freak show of criminal egomaniacs in designer clothes. However, the Beekeeper is the wrong address for this, no compromises, no handbrake on, the cleansing of the system has only just begun. 101% cliché, completely reactionary, one embarrassing one-liner after another, characters from the prototype drawing board, Six Feet Under realism, women kissing fists, generally absolutely violent. The self-proclaimed film intelligentsia is boiling. Never mind, they would be taken away with them, just like any rudimentary servant of evil, plus anyone else who gets in the way of the Beekeeper, including civil servants. Too bad, that's the way it is when the pay cheque comes from hell. Statham does Statham things and Ayer is misunderstood in my opinion. He's just having fun making it as clumsy as possible, regardless of whatever! Demolition? Absolutely! Torture? No problem! Completely question the supposed institutions of jurisdiction and implementation? By all means! Even the top person in the government is involved in criminal business? Taken from life!I'm asking for a franchise, haha! Or at least a Beekeeper, if the lady from the office makes bureaucratic trouble again.","

",mareid-42865,15-Feb-24,"Honestly just a sad movie that makes out any generation after boomers are just out to steal their (boomers) hard earned money by ill gotten means. A poorly disguised attempt to tap into the boomers fear of the new generations who are expecting more and challenging the status quo. Completely stereotypical and inaccurate depiction of the new generations as uncaring,money driven and greedy. Unwatchable movie at best deliberately divisive at worst. Also the implication that if the law is broken and you don't believe democracy is working just go out and be a lone wolf? Dangerous messaging to some unstable types I think.

The Beekeper," High body count and a fairly decent action flick
",edwardrevans,12-Jan-24,"This is and out and out action flick with a very high and constant body count and a plot that slightly goes off the rails so you have to suspend belief. Essentially we have Adam Clay (Statham) who is a ghost in the system, retired until trouble comes knocking on a neighbour and friends door, so he comes out of retirement to avenge her suicide after she is defrauded by some online scammers. Now this is where I had the problem, as it transpires his friends daughter is an FBI agent who herself is torn between wanting revenge for her mothers death through what she eventually finds out who Clay is but also hunts him down to stop him. Putting that quandary aside (though it did bother me) the movie quickly marches on with everyone getting involved from the police to the FBI, hired mercenaries and even members from his secret organisation but why, well it becomes fairly obvious someone is that they all are trying to protect someone at the very top i.e the President. Statham does these movies very well especially the fight sequences as they are very inventive, so if you just want an all out fight fest then this is for you. No doubt if this makes money we will see more of the Beekeeper.","

Jeremy Irons is - sadly - one of those people. But, at the same time he is the only reason to stay till the end of the screening. Lousy writing, awful acting (especially ""female lead"" who should rather stay at doing commercial or soap operas if she cannot deliver solid performance in such an easy role in such a low aspiring movie - every time she is on the screen I cringe like an old avocado), even the lighting feels cheap and color correction looks like straight out from After Effects.In short: this is just yet another John Wick clone and let us remember that John Wick itself is at most mediocre level of entertainment.","

No holds barred action from the start to the finish in this action packed, out for blood, revenge flick.Interesting characters that at times look like X men characters. This movie had a lot to like about it albeit predictable at times.I did NOT like the female FBI character, Verona. She was cringey and unbelievable. I didn't like her appearance or presence in the film. I get it meets today's expectations, casting certain genders in roles to meet quotas however I believe this movie could've done without her. There's no way she'd get through basic training let alone survive this far into the movie if it was realistic, but all that aside - she wasn't good.Very entertaining and impressive flick.Not much to think about.Just enjoy the action amongst the gunfire.","

Glaringly ridiculous things happen that make little to no sense.Mafia boy takes some goons out to grandma's house, and shoot up some beehives.... sure, makes sense if you're 12 and getting revenge.The replacement girl that shows up at the gas station...WHAT THE F???? If you're a secret agent of basically any sort, your entire persona and style will be nondescript, you want to blend in EVERYWHERE. So of course she shows up, wearing hot pink, some stupid hairdo, oh, and a mini-gun on the back of her pickup.... which she then proceeds to shoot up this gas station, which doesn't seem to have anyone working at it.Fast forward to the end, and what was with the cowering drunken knife wielding guy at the top of the steps??? I know he's supposed to just throw the fight, he's just an unnamed grunt dressed like all the rest, but wow, go back to training classes on how to make it look believable.Also of note, are the utterly ridiculous costumes worn by the ""special squad"" morons. Who also don't seem to be fazed by who is coming after them. Cowboy hats and bright colored leather coats.... they must have shopped at the same place the replacement girl from the gas station did.Fbi girl, she seemed really really undecided on whether or not she did or did not want to apprehend Statham. She sees he's doing a good thing, doesn't like where it's taking him...OH WELL, let the man work and maybe he'll solve some problems you and your pals obviously can't or won't.It was decent enough to watch once, might give it another shot in a few years.","

",hydralien,02-Feb-24,"At this point, Statham could have just been bashing baddies non-stop till scores roll, and that'd be the best movie ever. No script, no dialogues, just bad guys facing their bloody demise. Well, maybe a few catchy tough guy phrases to top that.Sadly, this movie ain't it. There's some good fighting, and some catchy phrases too, and Statham is just as tough and amazing as ever. But also he's the only one who's doing any real acting, in between kicking bad guys. Even Jeremy Irons looks like he's just surviving through his role - not that the role is great, and the dialogs are meaningful (not by a long shot), but they could at least try.

",unsure-1,17-Jan-24,"I liked this movie. It's fun. It tried to go for a twist (a bit predictable), and of course as many have noted, it's very close to John Wick. No it's not a secret society of assassins, it's a government program that goes above the law. But it's a rogue retired super pro who everyone is afraid of. He goes on a revenge spree, and then continues more in the name of justice. And then also because it turns out that the beehive needs a new queen or whatever.The worldbuilding rules here are worse than John Wick. John Wick's world has style and nuance. It's inspired by eclectic influences.This is inspired by GI Joe morning cartoons and someone who read a book on bees.Jason Statham plays Jason Statham.

I guess what I find the most objectionable is the lack of professionalism with the FBI. I am not a fan of them, but having worked with them for years, the one thing they are is professional. They also don't usually become chubby and obnoxious until they are much higher up. So seeing someone in blue jeans briefing their supervisor or at a crime scene isn't going to happen. They're never first on scene, they really aren't Pigsknuckle Arkansas PD.The fight scenes are terrific. Statham is himself and excellent as the stoic antihero.However, the addition of the clown security group was almost too much to take, not to mention the ""carnival"" at the Presidential home.I do enjoy the apparent commentary on our dysfunctional Executive Branch of the US.

Which leads into something more than he expects.Awesome plot which he follows a certain set of guidelines until the system is broken is were he steps in and at full force to stop the threats. The action sequences are awesome. Jason Statham was great. The rest of cast ensemble is good too. David Ayers direction is full of fast paced and action that makes this film worth seeing on the big screen.

This movie is going nowhere, but somehow, someway, turns out to be pretty entertaining. The first third of it is like a bad joke with characteristic characters.Still it manages to go through to the next level, where the characters stay stupid, the plot stays dumb, but the action is on high volume. Emmy Raver-Lampman and Bobby Naderi can easily get into the Razzies of this year with ridiculous performances and their part of the written script is just a perfect example for bad writing.No feelings or interest for any of those supporting characters and if we can say the truth - none of those for the main character. But still, as his prime action movies of the beginning, Jason Statham manages to keep consistency with good performance and the movie is pulling through with good action sequences.David Ayer made some good (and bad) movies before. He knows exactly what is needed for the audience to keep his eyes on the screen and he pulls it of once again, without any hard work. The writing is not good, but the stars of this movie gives him larger weight with good side performances.I am talking about Jeremy Irons, On a small and significant role And also about Josh Hutcherson, as the villain of the movie, which is doing good job. Through some of the stages of the beginning it seemed that this one is going to be really bad, but sometime, along the way, it got better and this is what is burnt in our consciousness at the end.","

Who wouldn't want to kill all of them, repeatedly, in overly dramatic fashion?The threads of the murderous murdering are brought together by a pair of FBI agents whose connection to the characters are the only thing that makes any idiotic sort of sense. Adding in unnecessary alcoholism which still permits the female agent to do heroic physical stair climbing, and adding in details of the male agent's family that nobody cares about, were not needed.The climax is just hilarious.

",arsalanweb,01-Feb-24,"""The Beekeeper"" makes a valiant effort to step into the realm of the John Wick universe, but unfortunately, it falls short of capturing the same magic. While the film attempts to emulate the intense action sequences and mysterious underworld, it lacks the finesse and storytelling prowess that made John Wick a cult classic.The plot feels a bit contrived, and the characters don't have the same depth that we've come to expect from this genre. It's clear that the filmmakers were inspired by the success of John Wick, but they struggled to replicate the unique blend of style, choreography, and storytelling that made the original franchise so beloved.However, the saving grace of ""The Beekeeper"" is undeniably Jason and his action figure. Despite the movie's shortcomings, Jason's performance is commendable, and his dedication to the role shines through. The action figure, a nod to his character, is a collector's dream, capturing the essence of the film's attempt at creating a memorable hero.While ""The Beekeeper"" may not reach the heights of the John Wick series, it manages to entertain with its thrilling action sequences and Jason's charismatic portrayal.

With that said, Jason pulls off another great entertaining movie. You better buy a popcorn bucket and a large drink! You are going to need it.","

The Beekeper," What you would expect but more brutal
",hifiman-62270,16-Jan-24,"Actually no idea why the story is being regarded as poor. It's relevant in today's age of rampant online fraud. And the fact that people who exist who shall we say have ""ghosts"" past is hardly the thing of imagination. So actually its quite a simple revenge flick based around reality..however of course it's a Statham flick so he has to be phenomenal and virtually unkillabe. But it's all done in a very well staged way. Exciting . Brutal. Simple and brief and efficient. I'd say it's a less styalised grittier John wick style movie and expect a sequel to be greenlit very very soon. Don't expect anything else and just enjoy be the ride.","

The Beekeper," actually a dark comedy , or seriously inept scriptwriter ?
",rossmcdee1,31-Jan-24,"Firstly - this is quite enjoyable - an almost typical , cliched action film with brutal fighting and predictable story... except for a couple of things worth mentioning.The story is so utterly preposterous & contrived it comes across as a po-faced comedy. The main female protagonist (FBI Macy Gray look-a-like) is so terrible she can't help but incite laughter or mirth at her actions.She also pulls some hilarious pouts during the film, while her motivations appear increasingly deranged- why is she making so much effort to tackle the man who got revenge for her & her mother - why does she do nothing about the parasites who stole from her mother when Stratham's character has opened all the doors for her to do so? It is farcical- yet still entertaining if the viewer is in the right frame of mind-If you take this sort of comic book fare seriously you will find it unbearable- such as when Stratham is at the 'party' & shows himself- why did he do all of what follows ,when he could have archived his goal far more simply & effectively just by shaving his beard off or wearing a wig & dark glasses - because the writers thought the scenario would be 'cool'.THIS FILM IS A BLACK COMEDY , intentionally or otherwise.There are so many more silly instances that could be mentioned but they will probably be more entertaining experiencing them watching the film, instead of me just listing them here.I noticed some reviews mentioning that this film explores serious issues of conspiracy- it doesn't - it ignores the vast network of family interests, bonds & consolidations that allow any 'individual' to become a prominent public figure, or even successful business enterprise.... It is a COMIC BOOK ACTION FILM and doesn't pretend to be anything more. As such it is quite entertaining.Usually I would mention all sort of technical matters, but there is no need to with this- it's decent, everyone does their job adequately.The fight scenes are brutal and reasonably well staged, but rather ridiculous as well, none of Strathams adversaries can aim a gun,and he has no serious challenges for most of the film. Despite that fact, if you can enjoy the utter unbelievability of the story the action can be even more entertaining than a more 'realistic' portrayal of such encounters.6.5 out of 10 - for the shear preposterousness of the story & entertainingly awful acting of FBI Girl.","

",16-Sep,03-Feb-24,I can't believe this was written by the same guy who wrote the Law Abiding Citizen and the Equilibrium. You should be ashamed of yourself for writing this crap. An amateur could do a better job.As I have hinted in my first two sentences the writing is atrocious. The dialogues are below b-movie standards. The characters are hilarious and not in a funny way. The acting is horrible all around. There is nothing clever about the plot. Even the fight scenes are not good enough. Fight choreography and shots are mediocre.I love Jason Stathom.

Bad acting , bad script and the whole thing is making no sense for me to be honest
The character of verona is one of the worst written characters
They tried to make another version of john wick but this went so wrong.Also i don't know wtf is going on with all of these cops , i mean none of them can shoot with a gun ??? I know it's just a movie but not putting at least some logic on it is so annoying for me tbh

Anyone who challenges him is dismantled in a variety of tricky ways, while he gets barely a scratch. Just don't spend too much time thinking about the details of the plot, but it does have a few twists. I'm sure those who are actually in the FBI hate this movie and anyone in the Secret Service would REALLY hate it, they are all shown to be such lame nincompoops who have no clue how to protect a threat target. Probably the lamest plot line is about gang of men that look like they came directly from Burning Man armed with automatic weapons wandering around a party at the private mansion where POTUS is currently located, doing whatever they want, talk about idiotic. Watch it for the action, some great fight scenes, just don't expect any sort of realistic plot.","

The idea of the beekeepers is, cool since there a mystery, they are the boogeyman. They aren't known much and people are scared of them for that reason. If you like a good action, it through out the whole movie.

The Beekeper," Beekeeper, I thought I would be disappointed, but that was not the case.
",Beingcriticalsavesmefromdep_,14-Jan-24,"Beforehand I must say that no action movie in which Jason Statham has been the protagonist has disappointed me - this fact more because of his performance than because of the film itself; but what makes this movie not a ten out of ten is the script and some special effects. The references to bees, their hives, and his hierarchy would have fallen flat if they hadn't given a cursory recap of what a Beekeeper was in a scene that could have had more potential with something else as a prop. The references were made at perfect times, but due to the lack of depth to the character's history and his morals as a beekeeper, they made it sound like an anime fan dropping a line from his favorite anime to make the action more ""interesting.""The fights lacked any noticeable special effects, making them seem like just choreography, making them perfect. The blows were not crazy, meaningless blows that made the victim simply die, they were blows true to reality, something that every action movie should have. The shots were not the crème de la crème, but they were the minimum that an action movie should possess. Close-ups that showed everything in detail, each death without being censored with a shot of the protagonist in close-up with blood splashing on his face or with a scream in the background (only one, and it really made me a little angry, since which was exceeding my expectations, up to that point). I didn't really highlight the lighting work in itself, except for the scene where Adam Clay fights against the private security in the second building of the scam ring by turning on the fire alarm. Yes, that specific lighting is very cliché in action or horror movies, but in this case it gave a fresh feeling to the change of static and non-creative lighting in fight scenes.What disappointed me a little more, in addition to the aforementioned, is how poorly they delved into the story of corrupt power. I feel that they portrayed it very over the top, not going deep enough to make you leave the theater with a bad taste in your mouth for being aware of the corruption in the world.There are many things I would like to continue to say about this film, but I will stop, as my back hurts from typing so much hunched over at my computer. I recommend watching the film with a critical eye, as it can make you think about many things regarding the world of cinema and the world in general. I'm left with the fact that it was a delight of exquisite fights, but lacked depth in what sustained the plot.","

He's reached the Marvel status here (and that is not a compliment).As someone else already wrote, the dialogs are firmly on the cheesy side.All in all, a brain-dead movie, so much so that it's getting boring and even slightly annoying.5 is generous (it's really subpar) but the fight choreography is good (not that it's even remotely realistic, of course).A lazy cheesy farce for a rainy day.","

",mylesdsynger,16-Jan-24,"This movie exceeded my expectations by far. Still at its core roots being just a run around action movie, but with evidence of compelling acting from the lead cast. It's is one of Jason Statham most enjoyable recent action movies. The opening carries the storyline and sets a semi relatable premise, that connects the viewers to the core theme due to being able to possibly identify the initial characters with someone they know. This allows this exaggerating story with wild concepts to be easily followed and not lost while watching. While have captivating fights scenes, not shying away from gruesome finishings but sill being extremely watchable by not being very gore heavy. The antagonist is an antagonist through and through, not with a weak half baked redeemable message and I appreciate that from the movie. Definitely a recommended watch for casual fun.","

Dune," Picking your poison.
",CathodeRayTerrors,23-Oct-21,"When David Lynch unleashed his interpretation of Frank Herberts largely unfilmable political science fiction opus, many critics panned it as too condensed and disjointed.Fast forward to 2021 and another filmmaker takes a stab at Dune. There are many things Denis Villeneuve does well here, but again missing much of Herberts tone. In the end I feel Mr. Lynch had a better idea of what to cut out and what to leave in than Villeneuve did.You cannot have a adaptation of Dune without the politics, without the religion, without the internal monologues...even the crappy Syfy channel miniseries got that right.Now where this film does shine is in the visuals and costumes.departments as well as art direction. There is plenty to see and gawk over here.The casting is good. Timothy Chalamet is probably closer to the novel's description of Paul Atreides although Kyle MacLachlan captured the characters spirit and demeanor better. I'm a fan of Josh Brolin but I feel he is miscast here as Gurney. Patrick Stewart nailed it. The rest are good.I'm not too happy with the Baron's diminished role. And also the pronunciations of house names and titles are more like SyFy channel and less like Lynch. I prefer Lynch.It is definitely worth a watch or two. I look forward to seeing how it will be wrapped up in part two. But David Lynch's Dune will never be equaled, unless someday Jodorowsky gets to make his.","

Dune," Fear Is The Mind-Killer
",MisterJxroen,16-Sep-21,"Just watched one of the first screenings of 'Dune' at an IMAX cinema and damn, that were some of the best two and half hours of my life. I was hyped for this movie from the moment it was announced since I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve - but also because the story really spoke to me in a special sense. I haven't read the books, so this experience was very original and new for me.I was amazed when I heard about the amazing cast that was going to be in this film. When I saw them in action I was even more amazed, overwhelmed even. Every one of these top-tier actors brought their A-game to the set of 'Dune' and this makes the characters so much more interesting. The person the amazed me the most was Rebecca Ferguson. Her portrayal of Lady Jessica was absolutely outstanding.The visuals and cinematography in this movie were out of this world. You'd almost think that they actually filmed on different planets. You could pause the movie at any point in time and you would always be looking at a beautiful painting of its own. The sets were incredible, so were the special effects. You can really tell people worked hard on this.Hans Zimmer's score was pristine (as always). It really brought the universe of 'Dune' to life by creating a unique atmosphere of its own. The sound design was also incredible. I was a big fan of the loud, obscure sounds that were coming from many of the gigantic ships. It really gave you and idea of how large in scale this story is.As far as the story goes, I don't know if I can give a good opinion. I haven't read the books nor watched the previous adaptions, so I don't know if this adaption stayed true to the original. All I can say is that this story really pulled me in from the get go and didn't let go until a few hours after the movie ended. And I'm still not over it. I rate this movie 9/10 because I absolutely adore it, missing the one point because the ending didn't really feel like an ending. I truly hope part two gets made because this story deserves to be completed.","

Dune," I'd rather watch Spice World: The Movie.
",BA_Harrison,28-Feb-22,"I wonder what percentage of people who watch this latest adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune have actually read the book; I haven't. I found the film about as dry as the desert world on which it takes place. It looks a million dollars (it should... it cost $165million to make), with impressive production design, wonderful costumes, and top-notch special effects, but the storytelling is dull. Does serious sci-fi have to be so po-faced?Timothéeeee Chaletmaid plays 7-stone weakling Paul Atreides who gets sand kicked in his face by the Harkonnen, who launch a devastating attack after his family receive governership of the planet Arrakis, where the valuable commodity known as 'spice' is harvested. Surviving the assault, Paul and his mother avoid being killed by Harkonnen soldiers and eaten by giant sand-worms, and ultimately join forces with the indigenous people, the Fremen.Not being familiar with the source material, a lot of the finer plot details went way over my head, making the whole experience even more of a chore. And this film is only half of the story: director Denis Villeneuve has split the book into two halves, and is currently working on part two now that enough profit has been made from part one. I can't say that I'm particularly excited by the prospect of spending another two and a half hours on Arrakis.4/10 for the visuals, but not exactly riveting viewing.","

Seriously?The fight scenes are a joke, with his long adolescent locks making it impossible to see properly who he is fighting 'to the death', for goodness sake!I am a big fan of Rebecca Ferguson - who saved the Mission Impossible series - and thought she would be made for the part of Jessica, but here she lacked the poise to seem always in control of herself and the situation. She came across as far too vulnerable, like in the old fashioned mysoginistic portrayals of women (tripping over and having to be rescued by the man).It is a pity, because some of the other casting choices are good (Leto, Chani, Duncan). But the entire thing hangs on Paul and Chalamet possesses none of the required qualities - it might just as well have been Mickey Mouse; at least he was a mouse - so any notion of a series ought to be doomed (the idea that sycophantic teenagers can save this aberration is appalling to contemplate). This doesn't even match the 1984 film, which was already a disappointment, unable to come close to portraying the concepts of the magnificent book.Stick to the 2000 TV series, with Alec Newman - a worthy portrayal of Frank Herbert's classic story.","

Dune," Beauty without soul or substance
",arabnikita,26-Sep-21,"Dune (2021)By now, it is undisputable that Denis Villeneuve is a master of creating mesmerizing visuals and Dune is probably his biggest achievement as every single frame looks surreal. Frankly, I expected nothing less but ironically, the gorgeous visuals are also the reason for the film's weaknesses. On one side, they create an immersive experience; on the other, it feels like the director is trying to show off instead of crafting a compelling story for the audience to connect to. Nevertheless, it is a movie and it is bound to deviate from the source material so I will try to judge accordingly.While Villeneuve is an artistic genius, this isn't one of his personal art house projects but an adaptation of the greatest Science Fiction novel, which naturally carries expectations. The world of Dune is as complex as that of Game of Thrones where everything is intricately connected and the multilayered characters are filled with ambition; not to mention the philosophy. Unfortunately, none of this is created here and half of the big name actors are reduced to saying a few lines in favor of showing 15 pointless visions of Zendaya in the desert.By struggling to establish the characters and the narrative, the film ends up lacking a soul and as result, it is impossible to care about anything. Yes, every shot looks phenomenal but it doesn't stir a single emotion and no matter how pivotal the scene is, it just feels hollow. The excessive long takes leave little time for development and hence, key narrative moments end up being rushed. Even some action scenes feel underwhelming as they lack any energy and almost feel forced.Despite the anticlimactic end, I am eagerly waiting for Part 2 which will hopefully explain the world and allow the remaining characters to flesh out. Chalamet did a decent job as Paul but he needs to put on some muscle as he is pitiful to look at during the action sequences. At the end of the day, Dune is one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen with the aesthetics and sound being worthy of IMAX. Sadly, the essence and complexity of Dune itself feels either rushed or lost in between the grains of sand and the panoramic takes.Movies.shmovies in Instagram for movies and tv shows.","

Dune," A Towering Mediocrity
",fung0,27-Oct-21,"I can't say I'm disappointed with Dune, given the track record of director Denis Villeneuve. In the past, he has stooped to artsy garbage (Enemy), weak adaptations (Arrival, which avoids exactly those elements that made its source an unsettling classic), and hollow spectacle (Blade Runner 2049, an endless, empty, at times ludicrous mess).That said, I didn't hate Dune. I simply found it lackluster.The good: the visuals are splendid. The music is nice, though not exactly memorable. The narrative sticks wisely close to the book.The not so good: first of all, the casting. Not one of the actors in this film really blows me away. Paul Atreides, in particular, is far too weak to hold our attention. Not terrible, but at the same time not capable of suggesting the hidden strength that will soon make him a leader of men, a 'mahdi.' Jessica does a nice job with what she's got, but the script leaves her little to do but whimper, without suggesting the deep well of authority the character should have. The Duke Leto probably fares best, though again I think he's portrayed as a rather weak character, not the iron duke of the book.The worst: the pacing. I didn't find the slow, deliberate pace to be annoying. However, Dune the book is actually both dense and fast-paced. By taking the slow road, Villeneuve leaves no room for the background and character depth that's really needed for a proper epic. Grand vistas are not what make films like Lawrence of Arabia great - it's the deep, powerful storytelling. Even if Villeneuve was allowed to stretch this franchise to three films, it would be too late to fill in the missing detail in this first installment.I hate to think what anyone unfamiliar with Dune, the book, will make of this eye-candy adaptation. Probably, they'll wonder why anyone would bother adapting such a lethargic and superficial book. Dune the movie comes across as a Cliff's Notes version of the book: faithful, yet without any of the juice that make the book so compelling. See it if you have a spare evening, but don't feel there's any urgency about it.","

Dune," Mixed feelings but overall very positive
",Manolo2001,18-Oct-21,"I am generally very critical of movies based on books, and definitely did not like Villeneuve's Arrival at all. In this case, as has been said frequently, it is a tad slow paced, but the cinematics, the cgi, is flawless. So many takes are works of art, it is a beautiful movie, there is no doubt about that. The plot does stick mostly to the books, it is enough and sufficient for it to be called Dune, not for example what has sadly happened to The Foundation. This is a take on Dune, there is no doubt about it, but it is a subdued take in terms of plot and the strangenesses (new word) the book has. There are a few missed opportunities, with the Harkonnen, the Sardaukar, Navigators, etc. By this I mean that although the uniforms, the visuals etc. Are amazing, the 1984 movie was much more weird and intense in terms of portraying a foreign or future universe. This is much more mainstream, the plot could take place in any average sci fi world filmed before. As amazingly grandiose as it is, it lacks Duneness (new word again), I would have hoped for a bit more spice in the movie.I will watch it again, as it is a very good movie, and would be quite awesome were it not for the book it is based on. But, having read the books (all of them) multiple times, it does fall short when compared to them. I would place it between the TV series and the 1984 Dune, closer to the original movie than the series, as it is stunning, but not as gruesome and intense as it could have been. The fremen also lack a bit of punch, I will not go on, as I think the point is made. Looks amazing, but lacks a bit of spice.","

Dune," All strata of the human being, summed up in one masterpiece of cinema.
",valmont1702,19-Sep-21,"From its most complex layers, to the simplest ones... From the most joyful or deeply human moments, to the most horrible or deeply inhuman moments. Sometimes raw and dark as life can be, sometimes wonderful and magical as life can be...A universal saga in infinitely more ways than one... A mythology filled with values and philosophies colliding with one another... A multiplicity of beliefs, where certainties and uncertainties are entwined with one another, like two inseparable snakes seeking each other without ever finding each other...Mystical and evanescent, as well as concrete and visceral... Dreams and premonitions, choices and actions, space and time...

Dune," Dune: Part One
",Prismark10,10-Mar-22,"Just by the end of this almost 3 hours movie. I said to myself, this is where it finally gets interesting.Oops it is going to finish now.Denis Villeneuve has made an almost 6 hour long film and this is just the first part. It is a slog.One that looks great and it has wonderful special effects.Only the story moves at a crawl unlike the sandworms.David Lynch managed to make Dune in just over two hours, it was both weird and wonderful.The control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of a valuable spice that folds space has been transferred to the House Atreides. It could make them immensely rich.The House Harkonnen who previously operated the planet are livid.For Duke Leto Atreides this is a challenge that he cannot refuse. However it is a complex trap set by Emperor Shaddam who fears the House Atreides.Paul Atreides the precious son of the Duke has intense visions. Maybe he is the one who can unite with the Fremen, the natives of the planet Arrakis.Director Denis Villeneuve has made a wonderful looking movie. It is not enough if the pacing is off. The acting is somewhat stilted.Also why did he allow a shaven headed Stellan Skarsgård to mimic Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now!","

Dune," Spectacular and immersive
",johnandvaggelis,17-Oct-21,"Nitpics aside, this is a movie with amazing production design, a powerful score, masterful visual effects and phenomenal perfomances. As a fan of the book I can say that it delivered the story in way I didnt expect. It streamlined certain events yet managed to communicate the core messages of the book.I do believe however, that the soundtrack albeit BEAUTIFUL was sometimes undercut by the excessive ambience.(It didnt bother any of my friends though, so it might be a ME thing). Also ,I think that we could have had the ending about 10 minutes earlier. Some say that it ended abruptly but in all honesty the point where the story stopped seemed logical to me. It might be because I have read the book.It was a long ride but a suspenceful one. It might not be for everyone but it certainly was for me.Overall, It is truly a testament to the potential of science fiction and I cant wait for part 2.","

",imdb-702-986813,19-Sep-21,"I grew up watching the 1984 movie and had seen it a hundred times before I even knew the book(s) existed... :) so to me, this movie feels like ""a remake"" and not ""a new adaptation of the book.""Naturally, I can't help but compare the films.The pacing is much slower here, and I feel it gives the story a ""proper epic"" feel without going full Peter Jackson (The Hobbit/3 movies).There are enough differences between the two to constantly keep things interesting, though I feel some things are better explained in the 1984 version (less confusion and explaining things to my wife).Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this version, as I wasn't super-excited by the the first trailer.Given the strange economics of today's movie world, I'm not sure how the studio will decide whether or not to go ahead with Part 2 ... but I intend to vote with my dollars by seeing this at the theater at least one more time.Thanks!","

Dune," Impressive for both fans and non-fans
",yoentjebbes,01-Oct-21,"I saw it in 3D at the movies yesterday with my wife. I'm a huge fan, saw the David Lynch movie over and over, also the extended version (didn't like it much), the mini series from 2000 and of course the books (although only read until volume 4). My wife didn't know about Dune until she met me; she never saw any films or read any part of it.And we both were immensely impressed! What a movie!The images are really amazing, it really brings the atmosphere of a vast and dangerous hot sand planet and the harshness of politics and religious fanatics involved. My wife was overwhelmed, almost emotional. The movie follows the book perfectly (in contrast to David's Lynch's movie!) and only treats just the necessary information needed to follow the story so I can understand why some reviews say it is slow or not complete. But fans can recognize many details in it from the books which makes it really fun to watch!The story and characters are slowly evolving through images and not so much words or actions. The Fremen in the desert are really ferocious through their quietness and harsh looks and brutal decisions, really like you would expect from living on such a planet. And very different from the Fremen or other people living in the cities who are much more dependent on the rulers and living almost enslaved. A very short scene from Salusa Secundus depict the Sardaukar as fanatical soldiers but in an almost religious way. You can feel almost everyone in the story having a hidden agenda, although there is little explanation. Yes a lot of the story is left out but these all short but very impressive powerful scenes makes up for it. And made it great to watch for us both.The cutting in half of the story is well done, very distinct next chapter that will hopefully be filmed as soon as possible!","

Dune," Visually decent, but something is missing
",alex-322029310,27-Sep-21,"I have long waited to see this new attempt at turning Herbert's book into a movie. The ingredients sounded promising (Villeneue, Zimmer, cast, ...) as well as the praise the movie has received so far.Trying to immerse myself into the universe the film constructs, or better, translates from the book, I need to say for me there is something missing. I've seen Lynch's adaptation, have read the book, and played the Dune games (esp. Dune 2) day and night in my teenage days. Maybe it is because of this background, that I felt empty during most of the runtime of the movie. The book is difficult to translate to the screen, depicting not only the political conflicts, but also the inner conflicts and motivations of its protagonists vividly.The movie tries not to deviate too much from the book's storyline, which I have to give Villeneuve credit for. But in contrast to Blade Runner 2049, the movie runs quite flat on the emotional side. But as said, maybe because I already know what happens next, and have already immersed myself into the imaginative Dune universe countless times, I felt like I was in a half-dreaming state phantasizing these visuals, but not actually watching a captivating story.There is little dialogue and another point of critique is Zimmer's work in this. Someone here wrote that he considers the Dune soundtrack Zimmer's magnum opus, but to me this was Interstellar (2014). The score in Blade Runner 2049 was already quite minimalistic, but I credit Zimmer for at least using the CS80 like Vangelis did, thereby finding the right sounds for the futuristic setting. But here, in Dune, there is even more absence of any theme/leitmotifs, it's just a combination of a few chords and drones which sometime do not match the film's flow, with some occasional ethnic vocals which are absolutely over the top. It feels like Zimmer tried hard to find the right music for this movie, but in the end, delivered something absolutely generic that a young aspiring composer would probably be ashamed of.Nevertheless I think I can recommend watching the movie, especially for people who have not read the book. I hope Villeneuve will be able to deliver the second (and third?) part, because probably it will turn out that the movie was deliberately filmed in the style of a two hour long prologue.Just do not expect too much; I think the praise that the movie has received on its own is a bit too much for the actual product, but in the end, let's see where this franchise goes, probably this Dune will be the perfect movie if seen as a part of a trilogy.","

Dune," Best adaptation so far, but some nuance is gone
",vadim-berman,19-Sep-21,"Dune is a spectacular movie, but I can't give it 10 having read the book.The visuals are a gold standard. Villanueve is evolving as an artist, and if you imagine what the person who made Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 can do with a bigger budget and a bigger universe, you get Dune. Every single element of the Dune universe is faithful to the book and is beautifully realistic.The cast is great, with Chalamet and Bautista being standouts. Glossu Rabban is given a bigger role than in the book, even though it's still minor, and Bautista does not disappoint.The story: the universe of Dune is complex and the narrative is full of intersecting plot lines. Instead of blindly following the book, the adaptation is more focused and the expositions are not on the nose.However, maybe it's inevitable with a big screen adaptation, but some important plot points were lost. For example, the revelation of Paul about their connection to the Harkonnens, or the more detailed explanation about the imperial politics and the great houses. The importance of the spice production and what it does is not highlighted. Instead of the tangled web and complex origin story, it's basically foreign invaders oppressing indigenous people to extract resources. We are shown the mentats, briefly, but they are basically advisers... and that's it. Where is the mention of the ban on the thinking machines?The House of Corrino, the Spacing Guild, Feyd-Rautha are not shown. Hope they will be featured in Part 2.I suppose that's one of Villanueve's strong points, the ability to focus. But I remember the book well, so it feels like parts are missing.","

As with any book to movie adaption, I wasn't too thrilled about some of the decisions. The cast was well chosen. Because of the incredible leaps in CGI, some scenes were spot on. The acting was pretty spot on. Hans Zimmer did the music, but I found the constant presence of it a little on the monotonous side. I also could tell he paid homage to the previous movies, primarily the first one scored by Toto. The film also had moments when it dragged.I believe it will be well received when it's released.","

Or is the problem rather that those viewers themselves were emotionally hollow? I think it was emotionally rich. Just Beautiful. Makes me want to read the book next. Go watch it.EDIT: I have read the book now - it does it justice in all the right places and the few changes were wise choices (eg. The multiple visions of Chani and making Kynes a black woman - the book IS old after all and women or people of colour need more representation). So - well done! Very well done!","

Dune," A pleasure for the eyes
",Dello_,19-Sep-21,"Dune is technically perfect: direction, cinematography, score, acting, visual effects. It is truly a great cinematic experience and if you are interested you HAVE to go watch it in a theatre because it's visually majestic and the big screen helps fully enjoying it. Even the audio is important with a inspired score and great sounds in general and the big speakers of a theatre can contribute to a even better immersion. Dune is technically great as I said and it should be viewed but its ""part one"" nature is what could let down some viewers or maybe, as it has happened to me, not to fully appreciate the movie. In particular the protagonist has his arc and some important things happen but the movie does not tell a complete story and the ending seems more like the finale of a episode of a tv show rather than one of a movie and I'm already anxiously waiting for the sequel. In conclusion Dune is certainly worth watching, especially in a theatre, even just for its aesthetics but be aware that it is not a conclusive movie and be prepared for that.","

This movie has an intriguing story that will keep you guessing throughout if you are unfamiliar with the classic novel or David Lynch's version, which I was. I think that Dune Part 1 is an amazing setup for a couple of sequels, this is just the beginning, this is only part 1 of such a unique, captivating and beautiful story that's being told. This is not a Sci-Fi movie to joke around with, this is exactly how a Sci-Fi movie should be.I know that some people might say that this movie is slow, and is leaving so much stuff uncovered and unspoken about, and it has a lot of plot holes, but I think that it's necessary to leave breathing space for the characters and the audience, this is such a broad universe to cover, and it is so hard to fit all that into one movie.With all that said, I really think that you can see and tell what depth and passion that has been put on the movie screen by Denis Villeneuve, and I am excited to see how the story unfolds in the years to come.I definitely recommend it.","

Dune," Arrival Part II meets Blade Runner 2049
",Ashraile,16-Sep-21,"I've not read Dune, so I don't know how close it is to the book, so I'm going to have to judge it on its merits as a standalone film.And with that, this is going to sound nitpicky. If you've seen Denis' other works, you kind of know exactly what you're getting with Dune. That's not necessarily a bad thing; in fact I thought, as I saw the trailer ages ago, that Villeneuve was just about the perfect director choice for this movie, and after having seen the film, nothing has changed. Its just....Like, I get that this is set in the far future and ergo there will be lots of unique weird designs etc. But can we change it up a bit? And I would appreciate some spacecraft designs that make at least moderate physical sense, y-know?Although the movie clocks in at a meaty 2 hours and 34 minutes, somehow it still felt too short. Even knowing that this is one of two parts, I think that an extra half hour, Endgame-style, to flesh out a bit more worldbuilding and supporting characters would have helped a ton. A lot of characters' screen time felt comparatively way too short and you don't always know everything you would want to ahead of time. I would gladly watch a 3 or even 4 hour version of this movie.And while it was a wise decision to split a book like this into two parts it kind of suffers from Mockingjay syndrome where a lot of the movie is setup for part two. Don't get me wrong, a lot happens in the film, but once you watch it you will understand what I mean by that.That being said, the subject, theme, and visuals fit Denis' strengths as a filmmaker. I presume the flashbacks (forwards?) are part of the book's narrative as well. It is definitely a moviegoing experience and I am absolutely looking forward to part two.You already know the acting is impeccable with an all-star cast and the leads carry their roles. Timothée and Rebecca are absolutely perfect.But I can't rate the film overall as high as some of the other folks here.TL;DR: Does Dune stand on its own merits? Yes, it does, but expect some mild déjà vu. (Unintentional choice of words, but it's kind of funny that that phrase is also of French origin.)","

Dune," A real review
",ShaunV1990,15-Sep-21,"Is it a good, fun and visual stunning movie? YES, without doubt. This is by any means a slow burning sci-fi opera with one of the most beautiful cinematography in history. Is it a masterpiece? NO, absolutely not. I'm a huge Villeneuve fan. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most underrated movies in years in my opinion. The atmosphere he created there almost was perfection in it's finest form. Somehow he tried to do something similar in this movie, and it just didn't work out for the best. Visuals are important and are decisive factor for the atmosphere in the movie. Villeneuve does this as none other. You will be flabbergasted at many occasions. This in combination with the sound mixing and music by Zimmer really works out well. I love how he captured the somewhat religious vibe in the costumes and decor. Not many movie directors are able to let you believe this world could very well exist. The architectural minimalist approach of the decors really help to get you into the story. And here is where Villeneuve gets it wrong. Somehow the story never really gets launched. Mainly to do with too many bleak characters who are not able to carry the story. This results in a visual stunning sci fi opera with not too many story. And the little story you get is just too little. If you have not read the book you will leave the theaters with the feeling still not knowing what it was all about after 1 1/2 hours. The main problem was that Villeneuve couldn't decide where to end part one, resulting in a messy plot that wasn't a plot.Still I absolutely adored this movie. Because of the excellent atmospheric style in the movie you could not, not be mesmerised with what was happening on the screen. I have big hopes for part 2 where the story will actually really start. Perhaps splitting this movie in only two parts wasn't the best decision. Many people claim it was to slow. I think it was not slow enough and should really have focused more on an audience that doesn't know the full story.","

",Brukernavn03,15-Sep-21,"This movie is big. It's meant to be on the big screen. The visuals are captivating, the music is mesmerizing and the actors are convincing.This is an adaptation of the Dune novel from 1965, and it covers about half the book. I have read the novel long ago, but I'm mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It's a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to. But it's not dumbed down so that those who will recognize the names feel patronized. This is very hard to pull off, but I think this movie did so masterfully.I would describe it as a mixture between Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. You follow individuals in a grand and complex world. The majority of the movie takes place on a desert planet, so it really needed an amazing soundtrack to elevate the experience - and it has. Hans Zimmer turned down Tenet to work on Dune, and I think he made the right choice.However, this is only ""Part 1"", as it says in the beginning of the movie, so you know it won't be a complete story. I was ready to watch Part 2 as soon as it ended, but will have to wait. LOTR The fellowship of the Ring would be an insignificant movie without The two towers and The return of a king to complete the story. Together they are great, individually they are not enough. So it is with Dune - It is a great introduction, but it desperately needs a part 2 to conclude the story. And there better be a Part 2!","

Dune," A near masterpiece with major missing pieces
",residentgrigo,18-Sep-21,"I, first of all, applaud Legendary for allowing the director to do his thing on a budget of 165 million. No fan of the book can be disappointed by the end result but I don´t know if the general audience will see eye to eye as Villeneuve stuck too close to details that matter to him while leaving his audience and even the overall book behind. Dune 2021 is the best adaptation yet but too much of the plot and players were skipped to focus on Paul & Jessica who are the real film. The end result is an accurate depiction of their journey in the world of Herbert but it's debatable if his world & story are fully on-screen. Only Atreides characters are allowed any significant screen time and even their hereditary enemies the Harkonnen are reduced to bit parts. The grandiose and lived-in world is a sight to behold but we see so little of it and are explained even less so viewers might be confused why the film´s technology is so functional and basic. A was especially perplexed by how bare-bones the explanation of the spice is. It is the whole reason for the plot! No guild navigators or space-folding are seen on screen for example. The effects, costumes, score and performances leave little to be desired. The dialogue is easy to follow even if the context is often missing but some iconic book quotes are left behind. It is possible to view this film as your basic hero's journey narrative if one wants to. The way Herbert inverts and criticizes such tales is also all on-screen even if the fruits of these details will only ripen in the second half and hopefully movie 3. Aka Dune Messiah. Our director stated it as his current end goal.I don´t want to sound too negative and I had a great time with the film and look forward to revisiting it. I simply fear that the lack of mass appeal or rewatchability for casual audiences will leave the story forever unfinished. The film adapts 60% of the story, minus missing political elements & characters that a sequel would need to cover immediately before moving forward with the story. Let's just say that the film goes out of its way to not follow the Chekhov's gun principle. Watch and champion this movie if you are a fan of heady sci-fi and of course the Herbert novel(s) but push the source material, its full-cast audiobook, or its new 3 part Graphic Novel adaptation on the people you recommend the film to as they will need a safety net to appreciate the film and to be hungry for more. Let's hope against hope that someone will dare to adapt Dune 4 one of these days. Maybe the next reboot? 8,5/10PS: The 3-hour long ""Dune (1984) Alternative Edition Redux"" (7.5/10) is a solid companion to this film and features backstory and characters that have so far been skipped. Make it your next sci-fi viewing experience.","

Dune," Masterpiece
",Fanatic_movie_goer,18-Sep-21,"Dune is a very well done movie with a great cast, music, visual effects, scenery and the direction of the camera. It's an amazing feeling to see a movie that is payin an homage to the book.Frank Herbert made a great book about society and an messiah that is getting the feeling of a savior of the people. Denis Villeneuve took that book and made the best movie of the year with Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolinand many others.Timothée Chalamet shines in this role as Paul Atreides. He takes it all like he is the character and makes an amazing performance. Also he has the same qualities as Daniel Day Lewis and maybe he will be the next Lewis (John Campea said it first). Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem doesn't do much in the movie but while their on screen, they don't act the are the characters as does everybody else, but I just had to mention this two actors.The music is by Hans Zimmer and although it's all about the sounds and not the music that works for me. When Paul and his mother are fleeing for the second time that music was breathtaking. Zimmer has completely changed the way I listen to music, 'cause even I now will listen to just sounds and get emotional over it.The camera is so on point with all of the scenes. It has a way of showing you every little thing with out the audience yawning. I felt that the camera and music were really beautifully placed together and I had an emotional feeling to them at the same time.The plot is is really good but we have seen it already by David Lynch, this time we were waiting to see something different from the director of Arrival, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve. He is the master at tge taking time and gets you to feel the movie.","

Dune," Incredible movie!
",atmobilemail,18-Sep-21,"Finally, a Dune worthy of Herbert's vision. Like Blade Runner 2049, it took me until the following day to fully digest the assault on the senses. The difference this time around, is that it reminds me of certain Euro art films from the 70s where there would be long close-ups of expressionless faces. Perhaps Villeneuve was inspired by Jodorowsky's Dune in the 70s that was never made, that was supposed to have Pink Floyd composing the soundtrack? Otherwise, it is very dark and brooding like Blade Runner 2049, and very much like the book and the mini-series (script-wise), but nothing like the 80s movie. Jessica is a little more vulnerable compared to her 'regalness' in the novel - at least, that's how I remember her from my reading the trilogy three times. And one person has changed gender! Dr. Liet-Kynes is now played by a woman. Regardless of gender, Max Von Sydow in the 80s film stands above the rest, because it is Max Von Sydow and his uniquely quircky personality that can give an added dimension to any role. If WB doesn't allow for a part II, I will never see another WB film again.","

Dune," Majestically gargantuan
",alibaba3317,17-Sep-21,"Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel is a technical display of modern wizardry, an enormous and often thundering spectacle. It's best described as a sort of mix between Game of Thrones and Star Wars with religious parallels, which isn't very surprising since Herbert's novel was George Lucas' inspiration many decades ago.Dune's story is full of rich and often bizarre mythology, political conflicts on a galactic scale, raging battles between opposing forces and fantastical prophecies.It's a meticulously crafted vehicle to fully immerse you into the world; the movie takes deep care to establish lore and characters, unfolding at a slow pace. It's brilliantly directed in a calm but constantly tense premonition.The acting is superb all around, with standouts from Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica and Stellan Skarsgård as the villainous Baron Harkonnen. The latter manages to give the story a menacing, borderline supernatural presence.Hans Zimmer's score invokes historical grandeur and a sort of legendary, Arthurian voice. Greg Fraiser's cinematography is vast and big, giving the story's magnitude the scope it deserves. This is a very unique looking production and it shows up on set and in costume, tremendous artwork and design.As far as criticism goes, the movie lacks a proper ending. Sure, it's not the first movie to end on a cliffhanger, but it could still warrant an understandably inconclusive feeling. Aside from that, the pacing is also a possible deterrent for some viewers. It's long and methodically structured.","

",neoclone07,18-Oct-21,"My God, only 20 minutes into the movie and I was already mesmerized for the great masterpiece it is.The ambience, the music, the greatness of the halls, the unique take on the spaceships and tech... the list goes on and on.But the most astonishing were the Harkonnen. They""re now truly ruthless and savages psychopaths.Thanks, Dennis, for bringing such piece of artwork up to us.","

Dune," A near masterpiece with major missing pieces
",residentgrigo,18-Sep-21,"I, first of all, applaud Legendary for allowing the director to do his thing on a budget of 165 million. No fan of the book can be disappointed by the end result but I don´t know if the general audience will see eye to eye as Villeneuve stuck too close to details that matter to him while leaving his audience and even the overall book behind. Dune 2021 is the best adaptation yet but too much of the plot and players were skipped to focus on Paul & Jessica who are the real film. The end result is an accurate depiction of their journey in the world of Herbert but it's debatable if his world & story are fully on-screen. Only Atreides characters are allowed any significant screen time and even their hereditary enemies the Harkonnen are reduced to bit parts. The grandiose and lived-in world is a sight to behold but we see so little of it and are explained even less so viewers might be confused why the film´s technology is so functional and basic. A was especially perplexed by how bare-bones the explanation of the spice is. It is the whole reason for the plot! No guild navigators or space-folding are seen on screen for example. The effects, costumes, score and performances leave little to be desired. The dialogue is easy to follow even if the context is often missing but some iconic book quotes are left behind. It is possible to view this film as your basic hero's journey narrative if one wants to. The way Herbert inverts and criticizes such tales is also all on-screen even if the fruits of these details will only ripen in the second half and hopefully movie 3. Aka Dune Messiah. Our director stated it as his current end goal.I don´t want to sound too negative and I had a great time with the film and look forward to revisiting it. I simply fear that the lack of mass appeal or rewatchability for casual audiences will leave the story forever unfinished. The film adapts 60% of the story, minus missing political elements & characters that a sequel would need to cover immediately before moving forward with the story. Let's just say that the film goes out of its way to not follow the Chekhov's gun principle. Watch and champion this movie if you are a fan of heady sci-fi and of course the Herbert novel(s) but push the source material, its full-cast audiobook, or its new 3 part Graphic Novel adaptation on the people you recommend the film to as they will need a safety net to appreciate the film and to be hungry for more. Let's hope against hope that someone will dare to adapt Dune 4 one of these days. Maybe the next reboot? 8,5/10PS: The 3-hour long ""Dune (1984) Alternative Edition Redux"" (7.5/10) is a solid companion to this film and features backstory and characters that have so far been skipped. Make it your next sci-fi viewing experience.","

Dune," Masterpiece
",Fanatic_movie_goer,18-Sep-21,"Dune is a very well done movie with a great cast, music, visual effects, scenery and the direction of the camera. It's an amazing feeling to see a movie that is payin an homage to the book.Frank Herbert made a great book about society and an messiah that is getting the feeling of a savior of the people. Denis Villeneuve took that book and made the best movie of the year with Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolinand many others.Timothée Chalamet shines in this role as Paul Atreides. He takes it all like he is the character and makes an amazing performance. Also he has the same qualities as Daniel Day Lewis and maybe he will be the next Lewis (John Campea said it first). Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem doesn't do much in the movie but while their on screen, they don't act the are the characters as does everybody else, but I just had to mention this two actors.The music is by Hans Zimmer and although it's all about the sounds and not the music that works for me. When Paul and his mother are fleeing for the second time that music was breathtaking. Zimmer has completely changed the way I listen to music, 'cause even I now will listen to just sounds and get emotional over it.The camera is so on point with all of the scenes. It has a way of showing you every little thing with out the audience yawning. I felt that the camera and music were really beautifully placed together and I had an emotional feeling to them at the same time.The plot is is really good but we have seen it already by David Lynch, this time we were waiting to see something different from the director of Arrival, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve. He is the master at tge taking time and gets you to feel the movie.","

Dune," Incredible movie!
",atmobilemail,18-Sep-21,"Finally, a Dune worthy of Herbert's vision. Like Blade Runner 2049, it took me until the following day to fully digest the assault on the senses. The difference this time around, is that it reminds me of certain Euro art films from the 70s where there would be long close-ups of expressionless faces. Perhaps Villeneuve was inspired by Jodorowsky's Dune in the 70s that was never made, that was supposed to have Pink Floyd composing the soundtrack? Otherwise, it is very dark and brooding like Blade Runner 2049, and very much like the book and the mini-series (script-wise), but nothing like the 80s movie. Jessica is a little more vulnerable compared to her 'regalness' in the novel - at least, that's how I remember her from my reading the trilogy three times. And one person has changed gender! Dr. Liet-Kynes is now played by a woman. Regardless of gender, Max Von Sydow in the 80s film stands above the rest, because it is Max Von Sydow and his uniquely quircky personality that can give an added dimension to any role. If WB doesn't allow for a part II, I will never see another WB film again.","

Dune," Majestically gargantuan
",alibaba3317,17-Sep-21,"Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel is a technical display of modern wizardry, an enormous and often thundering spectacle. It's best described as a sort of mix between Game of Thrones and Star Wars with religious parallels, which isn't very surprising since Herbert's novel was George Lucas' inspiration many decades ago.Dune's story is full of rich and often bizarre mythology, political conflicts on a galactic scale, raging battles between opposing forces and fantastical prophecies.It's a meticulously crafted vehicle to fully immerse you into the world; the movie takes deep care to establish lore and characters, unfolding at a slow pace. It's brilliantly directed in a calm but constantly tense premonition.The acting is superb all around, with standouts from Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica and Stellan Skarsgård as the villainous Baron Harkonnen. The latter manages to give the story a menacing, borderline supernatural presence.Hans Zimmer's score invokes historical grandeur and a sort of legendary, Arthurian voice. Greg Fraiser's cinematography is vast and big, giving the story's magnitude the scope it deserves. This is a very unique looking production and it shows up on set and in costume, tremendous artwork and design.As far as criticism goes, the movie lacks a proper ending. Sure, it's not the first movie to end on a cliffhanger, but it could still warrant an understandably inconclusive feeling. Aside from that, the pacing is also a possible deterrent for some viewers. It's long and methodically structured.","

Dune," Bury it in a pile of spice
",JohnSeal,18-May-22,"I rarely review popular or well-known films, but I feel compelled to make an exception for Dune: Part One. While David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert's pretentious, nearly unreadable novel was bad enough, at least it featured Brad Dourif, Freddie Jones and a little bit of Lynchian weirdness. This remake, a bloated exercise in special effects, dispenses entirely with the weirdness in favor of a dry screen recreation of Herbert's turgid story of court intrigue on a planet far, far away, yet still populated by human beings. Add in a typically leaden Hans Zimmer score and you have one of the most overrated films of all time: even Oscar Isaac is left at the mercy of Denis Villeneuve's horrific dialogue. Few films entirely lack any merit or value...but this is one of the special few. The threat of a sequel is a chilling prospect.","

Dune," The Most Spectacular Film I Have Seen All Year
",ayaa1977,24-Sep-21,"Today I watched the most spectacular film I have seen all year. It's visuals are breathtaking, characters are well drawn (for the most part), and the allegory of the story (how spice and Arrakis are stand in for oil and the Middle East) is unmistakable. Hans Zimmer's score combined with fantastic art direction, and beautiful cinematography, all work intandem with Villeneuve vision as a director, to make this ambitious film worth the long wait, and a must-see in the biggest screen possible. The performances are all around great, although Rebecca Ferguson is the MVP. Timothée Chalamet acts like a sad emo for most of the film, but I suppose that's what's asked of him in the role. I don't agree with anyone who says the film is dull, but I suppose I am a sucker for the palace intruge part and all the politics, betrayal, and backstabbing, so the film having more drama and less action is fine by me. This is half a film (it says Dune-part 1 at the top of the film), so expecting a story that wraps up by the end of one film, is just as silly as being angry at ""Fellowship of The Ring"" ending with Frudo and Sam at the top of the that mountain looking at Mount Doom. I for one found this film very effective in building the world and preparing for the next part of the story, and I really hope we don't have to+o wait too long for part 2.","

",Kassdhal,15-Sep-21,"Worried like every time a great material is adapted it usually does not deliver on expectation.Here Dennis Villeneuve did the impossible: staying faithful to a complex and rich universe and a fantastic story with a masterful demonstration of direction, stunning visuals and solid acting.Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skasgard and Javier Bardem in particular are impressive while Chalamet was solid.My only (slight) issue is the fact that Lady Jessica is too emotional compared to the original character, and that we never see the emperor and the Navigators.I was afraid that the sex and race swap of Liet would feel forced and woke but it is well done and feels natural in the context of the film.So hat's off Dennis Villeneuve, this is another masterpiece under your belt.","

What Denis Villeneuve accomplished, with this masterful work, is something that I would define unbelievably epic, to say the least.The story of Dune takes inspiration from the book of the same name written by Frank Herbert, to start off with something fresh and new.Each actor from this stellar cast does his best to impersonate a well-developed and memorable character. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, in particular, stand out from the rest with their charming and powerful performances.Hans Zimmer really outdid himself, with an immersive soundtrack that proves, once again, that the right choice of music is essential to the overall sensoriale experience.The visual effects are some of the most impressive masterworks of digital art that I have seen in recent years. They are outstanding, incredible, phenomenal: that's because they allow you to immerse yourself deeply inside of the character-driven journey.Ultimately, this movie is an instant classic. We are witnessing the start of a new and exciting saga that is sure to convey a lot of drama and emotion to the public for years to come.","

Dune," A film heading to be a Sci-Fi-Classic
",severindringel,22-Sep-21,"That Denis Villeneuve has mastered the sci-fi-genre like no other has been known at least since Arrival. Accordingly, my expectations were high for his heart project Dune, originally a famous book that Villeneuve has loved since childhood and which, after years of delay, has now made its way to the big screen. Villeneuve is a great champion of cinema in danger of extinction - and what he already brought with Blade Runner 2049, he delivers this time on an even more extreme scale: a MOVIE FOR CINEMA.Since I see Dune as a potential saviour of cinema, it is more important this time to write about the film per se and not its actors and characters. These should be familiar to most beforehand anyway - both as book connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs. Because even though Villeneuve again relies on his tried-and-tested visual exposition, some prior knowledge of the family homes, rivalries and distribution of roles is certainly not a disadvantage. Therefore, rule number 1: roughly memorise the premise in order to be able to follow the plot comprehensively. As for the actors, it remains to be said that they all put on their absolute A-game. Timothee Chalamet shows that he can dominate blockbusters at a young age, although he is not the best despite a bravura performance. Namely, that's Rebecca Ferguson in the role of his mother, who pretty much downplays all emotional facets. All except joy, because no one really feels that in Dune. Now and then there are pseudo-funny one liners, but they are always overshadowed by the fundamentally dystopian and catastrophic atmosphere. This is just as well, because Villeneuve is not exactly known for making humorous and positive films. So, rule number 2: don't expect any fast-moving fireworks of words. What Dune definitely is is an audiovisual masterpiece display that you only get to see in this form every few years. Watching this film at home would almost be a betrayal. Such a feat does not deserve this act of cosiness; here the cinematic experience has monopoly. From the very first second, we are accompanied by elongated shots of the sky, high-tech headquarters and desert dunes. These left such an impression on me that after the credits I was at a loss for words and my legs were shaking. Rule number 3: Go into the film as relaxed as possible, because you won't get that feeling again so quickly afterwards.This guide on how to approach Dune properly is necessary to fully engage with the film. Otherwise, it could be complicated to get excited about it. Sure, the images should impress everyone, because this is where Dune is truly unique. The narrative style, however, is something that personally keeps me from giving Villeneuve's childhood dream the highest possible rating. In fact, I expected the film to be even more sedate and wordless, so in that respect I was pleasantly surprised after quite a few dialogues in the first half. Of course, Dune is not a film that needs many words, since its visuality speaks for itself anyway. Towards the end, however, I occasionally had the feeling that it didn't quite know when it wanted to end. Lethargic scenes suggesting that the film was now over were still followed by surprising twists. But that is a minimal criticism of what is, in my opinion, the ultimate revelation for cinema and metaphorical narrative structure.","

In fact, most dramatic elements of this story are replaced by digitalized special effects. The actors are like pawns on the screen, and they have little to say. The music accompanying the visual special effects replaces most of the time any elaboration of the dialogue or the characters.It is a shame for Timothée Chalamet who is underused some will say, though we do not know yet what he could really do in a dense and deep film, like the second part of the book ""Call me by your name,"" though this second part being some ten years after the first part, it might be difficult for Timothée Chalamet to play that particular part of the story.I just hope he may grow on the screen and have a career that could compare with DiCaprio's who was also naïve, superficial, and sort of stiff in his very first screen productions. Does Timothée Chalamet have the potential of a future star? Maybe, but I can't really see it, feel it in this film and in ""Call me by your name"" in which the easy provocative sexual side of the character was in many ways erasing the rest, though the teenager there was sexually depicted as naïve, superficial, and unable to be a real predator, the real predator he was supposed to be.So, watch it with a good one hundred grams of salt in your pocket, and keep the salt in your pocket, please.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUVERSION FRANÇAISECe film ne rivalisera jamais avec la précédente adaptation plus ancienne du roman de Frank Herbert, le film éponyme de David Lynch.

Timothée Chalamet a-t-il le potentiel d'une future star ? Peut-être, mais je ne peux pas vraiment le voir, le sentir dans ce film et dans ""Appelle-moi par ton nom"" dans lequel le côté sexuel facilement provocateur du personnage effaçait à bien des égards le reste, bien que l'adolescent y soit dépeint sexuellement comme naïf, superficiel et incapable d'être un vrai prédateur, le vrai prédateur qu'il était censé être.Alors, regardez-le avec une bonne centaine de grammes de sel dans votre poche, et gardez bien le sel dans votre poche, s'il vous plaît.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU.","

Dune," Dune Review (30/9/2021)
",KareemElagroudy,01-Oct-21,"First, I've got to say that Dune was a very great, and magnificent experience in IMAX. This is the first time to feel hyped for a book based movie since Harry Potter and honestly, WB made a big campaign for the movie that I like and respect. Lets talk about positives and negatives.Positives:
The visuals are greatThe acting was superb (Especially Chalamet and Ferguson)The score suited the movie in a good wayThe film itself isn't boring although it's longThe story is greatVillenuve handled the visions sequences in a good wayAction scenes were enormous.Villeneuve takes his time to build the world and characters (an advantage to those who never read the book and disadvantage to those who read).Although they had little screen time, Momoa, Brolin, Bautista, Duncan-Brewester nailed their roles (I honestly can't imagine any one playing these roles but them).The Fremen are presented as powerful, religious , yet dangerous.I like how Villeneuve showed how hot, sandy, and dangerous Arrakis is.Worms are perfectNegatives:
Although I've written that the story was good but it missed many aspects that could've made it quite better and that's a many based on a novel movies problem.A lot of story is left out from the movie but you won't get lost in the movieBut honestly these negative points doesn't affect the movie that muchOverall, comparing to the OG Dune, Villenuve's Dune is quite spectacular and it deserves a 9.5/10. I recommend everyone to see it in IMAX because believe me, it's liks nothing you've seen before.","

La musique qui accompagne les effets spéciaux visuels remplace la plupart du temps toute élaboration du dialogue ou des personnages.C'est dommage pour Timothée Chalamet qui est sous-utilisé diront certains, bien que nous ne sachions pas encore ce qu'il pourrait vraiment faire dans un film dense et profond, comme la deuxième partie du livre ""Appelle-moi par ton nom"", bien que cette deuxième partie étant quelque dix ans après la première partie, ce pourrait être difficile pour Timothée Chalamet de jouer cette section particulière de l'histoire.J'espère simplement qu'il pourra grandir à l'écran et avoir une carrière comparable à celle de DiCaprio, qui était également naïf, superficiel et un peu rigide dans ses toutes premières productions à l'écran. Timothée Chalamet a-t-il le potentiel d'une future star ? Peut-être, mais je ne peux pas vraiment le voir, le sentir dans ce film et dans ""Appelle-moi par ton nom"" dans lequel le côté sexuel facilement provocateur du personnage effaçait à bien des égards le reste, bien que l'adolescent y soit dépeint sexuellement comme naïf, superficiel et incapable d'être un vrai prédateur, le vrai prédateur qu'il était censé être.Alors, regardez-le avec une bonne centaine de grammes de sel dans votre poche, et gardez bien le sel dans votre poche, s'il vous plaît.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU.","

Dune," Dune Review (30/9/2021)
",KareemElagroudy,01-Oct-21,"First, I've got to say that Dune was a very great, and magnificent experience in IMAX. This is the first time to feel hyped for a book based movie since Harry Potter and honestly, WB made a big campaign for the movie that I like and respect. Lets talk about positives and negatives.Positives:
The visuals are greatThe acting was superb (Especially Chalamet and Ferguson)The score suited the movie in a good wayThe film itself isn't boring although it's longThe story is greatVillenuve handled the visions sequences in a good wayAction scenes were enormous.Villeneuve takes his time to build the world and characters (an advantage to those who never read the book and disadvantage to those who read).Although they had little screen time, Momoa, Brolin, Bautista, Duncan-Brewester nailed their roles (I honestly can't imagine any one playing these roles but them).The Fremen are presented as powerful, religious , yet dangerous.I like how Villeneuve showed how hot, sandy, and dangerous Arrakis is.Worms are perfectNegatives:
Although I've written that the story was good but it missed many aspects that could've made it quite better and that's a many based on a novel movies problem.A lot of story is left out from the movie but you won't get lost in the movieBut honestly these negative points doesn't affect the movie that muchOverall, comparing to the OG Dune, Villenuve's Dune is quite spectacular and it deserves a 9.5/10. I recommend everyone to see it in IMAX because believe me, it's liks nothing you've seen before.","

Dune," This is not a story about white saviors.
",ruidanielbarrossss,17-Oct-21,"What can I say. Not only did I watch this movie, but my body was astrally projected to Arrakis.I got goosebumps whenever Hans Zimmer's melody pulsed through every sequence in this movie. I was surprised by the scale of the film's production. I went into trance together with Paul Atreides when he discovered that the tragic fate he envisioned was coming true.This movie only partially loses because it's half of a whole. I want to see more but I can't.Boring! For those with terrible taste, I have no doubts about that.As for the criticism of the white savior, read the damn books. Or just pay attention to what you're watching.Midway through the film, Paul has a vision of the future, in which the dangers of charismatic leadership elevated to godhood are thrown in the viewer's face. You have to be really mindless not to notice.This is one of the most epic sci-fi movies of all time. Watch it on the biggest screen you can.","

Dune," The best screen adoption of Dune
",ydurgut,27-Sep-21,"Maybe cine-tech advanced enough or adopters realized it would not be enough to have a 2-hr movie even from a single book, this one is definitely the best adoption for me.One crucial criticism would be if this movie will be comprehensible for the ones who haven't read the book(s). That the whole movie jumped into action as soon as it started will be something hard to catch up for the ones not familiar with the first book or the Dune saga.I would really recommend a read at least of a synopsis of Dune before watching, to understand the background, the Houses of Corrino, Attreides, Harkonnen, Bene Gesserit, Space Guild, and what spice melange is.","

Dune," An Instant Classic/Masterpiece for All Time
",scottmannen1,22-Sep-21,"The original Dune film created and released by David Lynch is undoubtedly a cult classic film. This 80's version of Dune was epic with grand visual cinematography, breathtaking costumes and a story that absolutely is a masterpiece. Where the original falls short is on flow and pacing. It dragged out in some areas.The new Dune film created by Denis Villeneuve contains many similarities when compared side by side with the original. In fact, the new Dune more closely follows that novel, and instead of having one long movie like the original, the new Dune fits about half of the original Dune story into a 2.5 hour film whereas the original fit the entire novel into that same 2.5 hours.The good news is that by splitting the novel into a 2 part film such as Villeneuve has done, it captures more of the novel in total. The result is a more detailed dive into the Dune novel that effectively eliminates many of the pacing issues that plagued the original film.The cinematography is next level on visuals. The world of Dune is breathtaking to see visually. The costumes are unique and gorgeous to view. It is very clear that Dune is a film with a massive budget...something that is quite rare to see anymore. Studios are more careful than ever when it comes to doling out the budget for blockbuster films anymore. In recent hits the only films with such large budgets are usually just Marvel films, so it is refreshing, unique and simply a visual treasure to look at this blockbuster film type that is actually filmed in IMAX for that incredible experience.We know the budget is there, but how about the story? Since this films source material comes from Frank Herbert himself, one simply could not have asked for a better story. In fact Dune is quite often hailed as the single greatest sci-if novel EVER created, and that is an accolade that is no small feat! The key was for Villeneuve to accurately convert that story into film accurately. I am pleased to say that this was clearly handled with kit gloves and deftly converted in a very effective manner. In my opinion we have an INSTANT CLASSIC film! The story and even the pacing is as close to perfect as many could have hoped!The acting and actors for Dune is simply a roster of some of the most talented A-list thespians on the planet! I could name this list for you here, but it is long and ""star studded"" as they say. The acting is fantastic and well performed across the board. The surprise performance out of an already amazing list would surprisingly go to Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin who brought ""sizzle"" t9 their respective roles! Additionally, the role of Paul by Timothy Chalomet was good but particularly Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica is a stand out for sure.This film is absolutely worth the money to go ""experience"" at IMAX. Notice I said ""experience"" as opposed to saying watch? This film in IMAX is just that type of film. Most people watch films, but Dune is a movie to ""experience"" if you are able to attend in IMAX. This show ranks very high across the board in every single category, but the entertainment value is particularly high, something that can be difficult to achieve in such a long run type film.9.5/10. I haven't really ever issued a perfect score to any film, but since I am unable to review score an IMDB film at 9.5/10, I then give this film score a 9/10 official review. I have only ever given out such a high score once, and that was for Game of Thrones who I rated the same. Do yourself a favour and view this in IMAX, worth every penny!","

Dune," A risky experiment gone right.
",lukas-sumper,21-Sep-21,"I did go into this with holding my expectations to a minimum, saying to myself it could at least be a good arthouse style movie. Well, this was more than that but I want to start with the parts that I disliked.The exposition in the beginning was a bit forced, and was a lot more voice over than showing us unlike LOTR did with its great intro. Also Dennis film making style gave a lot of characters less screen time than what I expected. You basically see a lot of great A-list actors for less than 10 minutes. Which was understandable since he focused his attention on the protagonist.So you could even go so far and call making dune a two part series a necessity and if it gets a sequel the first one will work even better, especially if the second part has flashbacks of exploring some relationships more, which felt lacking in this one.The other reviews praise cinematography and Sound design/ music enough to drive the point home, I was impressed even though you knew who the team was behind this movie. It sets a new standard.Personally having seen every movie Villeneuve made except his very first one, this is my new favorite after prisoners. I am more hyped after I watched it, knowing cinema isn't just dead yet.","

Dune," Wanting more
",strategghost,21-Sep-21,"Where blade runner 2049 felt meandering - and it's best compared to blade runner 2049, both great movies - Dune always felt exciting. The great acting and directing gives the movie a soul of its own.This one is a cinema event. Music and sound effects, the large vistas, the grandiose battles. The special effects adds to the movie, making the fighting seem more desperate than it otherwise would have been. My biggest complaint is that it's made for pg rating. My 2nd (and last as of seeing it once) that the march music is so melancholic.","

Backed up by solid performances from a heavyweight cast, you'll certainly enjoy the movie.Bare in mind I haven't seen the originals. Nevertheless, I felt the story could have had more depth, but certainly not enough reason to trash the movie. They're merely paving the way for better things to come (hopefully).There's absolutely no reason you should skip this movie.Happy watching.","

Dune," 40 YEAR FAN Review
",mustangride,08-Oct-21,"I first read the Book in 1981 at the age of 12, I know all the series and the history and lore it was the first sci-fy books I fell in love with. I knew the Lore it could not be made in to a movie. This is true the tech was not there.Well 2021 the tech is here and Denis brought the Dreams of this Sleeper to life. The scale was truly worthy of the story, I hate using the word ""Epic"" but in this case it is warranted.I gave it a 10 because we cannot give it a 9.5. It is not a perfect 10, there is issues with the story (There is a lot of backstory missing people who have not read the books will be lost because of) It really needed a Princess Irulan, Opening Monologue, the one we got was useless and a waste of bringing the casual audience up to speed.The story Moved along at a slow pace when so much more could have been added in that time instead of wasting it on to much of the ""epic scenery / shots"". Final draw back was way to much of of the Soundtrack, Most shows dont have enough this one was way to much which in certain scenes detracted from the Movie. Less is More in some cases and this one needed less Hans Zimmer.It is well worth seeing on the Big screen, then multiple times at home.","

Dune," Perfect build up
",Xamalion,15-Sep-21,"This is a breathtaking movie. Visually a masterpiece. Wonderful cast, especially Rebecca Ferguson. It is a treat for fans, you can even see glimpses of Alia very early on, which makes me longing for the full series. It is visionary, perfect pacing and setting up the scene for what is to come.But, and here it comes: when the movie finished, a guy sitting beside me started complaining that he doesn't need a next chapter, because he already almost fell asleep watching this one. And my fear is, that a majority of people will see it that way. Because many have forgotten that sometimes a story needs time, characters need time and also we as an audience need time to arrive in a universe as complex as the Duneverse.So my hope is, that also a majority of people will love it the way I do. And that Denis Villeneuve will bring all the books to life. But in the meantime: Thank you Mr. Villeneuve for this movie. It was the first one I saw in a cinema for almost a year. And it reminded me why I love going to the movies.","

Dune," Villeneuves tenet
",jonah-jf,18-Sep-21,"I would give it just 9.5, because I think the importance of water came up short. And I also missed the banquet scene, what could have been a really clever scene with good dialogues.But the film is absolutly great, the actors are without exception awesome, the scenes/ the dialogues are perfect, the length of the film is perfect, it's close to the books (great story) and the visual effects are insane (beautiful scenes -> action/fight scenes/nature/spaceships/worms/citys). You can see how much love Villeneuve and the actors put in and I really want to see more. This is the beginning of a new universe. The time I have to wait for part 2 will be hard.In my opinion Villeneuve and Nolan are the best regisseurs in the world and they both made their visual/ their (characteristic for them)/signature masterpiece with Dune and Tenet. I love it.","

Dune," Set up for disappointment but boy was I wrong...
",Snidgy,20-Sep-21,"Let me start off by saying I am not the biggest connoisseur nor fan of the original Dune book and/or earlier movie and series adaptations.And, contrary to some of the remarks made on this forum I am also not related to the director or hired to write this review. I can also understand that this movie may not be to the liking of quite a few moviegoers and some may even feel somewhat cheated after seeing the movie versus the trailer. It may not be the 'Frozen'-type of deceit (both my sons expected something completely different that time around, LOL) but still Dune is set up quite differently in the trailers (primarily more action-focused) than the movie itself turns out to be; at least this first part.I myself so much wanted to enjoy this movie which in my case usually can only lead to disappointment in the end....Having said all of this I personally can only conclude that I truly, whole-heartedly LOVE this movie. It is immersive beyond anything I have seen in cinema over the past decade, and maybe even during my lifetime. The feel of the worlds in which the story place (Caladan but obviously primarily Arrakis) is so brilliantly portrayed that I immediately felt drawn into the story and stayed that way throughout the full length of the movie.The mythological aspects of the story and analogy with Western civilization versus 'the rest' of our own world managed to make the movie really recognizable despite of the obviously completely fictious setting. The acting, dialogue, directing, art direction, cinematography, special effects, color pallet, pretty much every aspect of this movie was top-notch.Just a last quick warning of what Dune is NOT: It is NOT a modern Star Wars-like adventure with laser guns. It is NOT an action-packed Marvel-type movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 35 minutes straight (and don't get me wrong, I personally really enjoy those type of movies as well).Dune may take a bit of an investment by some to understand what it's not and to appreciate what Dune actually is; a truly marvelous piece of filmmaking, enriched by a true love of cinema of the filmmakers and where the story itself is the most important of all (not the thrills or special effects).Watch it on the biggest possible screen you can find and enjoy.I sincerely cannot wait to see part two and to marvel at the conclusion of this epic piece of cinema.What a time to be alive and witness this.P. S. If Warner Bros' decision to simultaneously launch Dune in the US on HBO Max and in cinemas, will result in disappointing box-office results and, as a consequence, limit the production budget or even worse, possibly the making of Dune part two, I will seriously contemplate boycotting WB for the foreseeable future.","

Dune," Simply great, an instant classic!
",Criticalstaff,18-Sep-21,"The biggest question with this film was: was Villeneuve able to deliver? You got one of the most popular sci-fi novels, a cast of talented and very charismatic actors, and a generous budget. Was Villeneuve the right choice to direct this film; could he muster all these resources and use them effectively to tell a story? Could he make a film that is enjoyable to watch and at the same time adapt a convoluted cult-classic on which numbers of filmmakers have stumbled?Turns out, the answer is yes.The real cornerstone of the movie, if you put aside the special effects, the plot and the visual storytelling, is the pacing. The film takes its time and lays out confidently most of the techno-babble and sci-fi jargon upfront. Yet, it is not boring or annoying. In any situation or scene, you know what is going on, who is doing what, and generally speaking the action is clear. That is something that was absent from Lynch's Dune. It is challenging to deliver a lot of information in a digestible manner, especially with the sort of sci-fi such as Dune. But the movie does it patiently and clearly. Most of the time a concept is set-up in one scene and then shown or explained in the next. Not only was everything clear in terms of stakes; but it was also engrossing in terms of tension. Not only do you understand what Paul is up against, but you want him to succeed.The story of Dune is the story of Paul Atreides, the young heir of a noble family. One thing that is cool in Dune is: it's feudalism in space. So, you get something that is closer to Game of Thrones than Star Wars.The movie follows the adventure of young Paul. How he makes the transition to a new world, has to come to grips with becoming a leader and is destined to become a prophetic messianic figure. That stuff is good, but I always thought it was the weaker aspect of the novel Dune. The story of a young boy who discovers awesome powers that leads him to rule the universe is pure power fantasy. It is more appealing to young boys than anyone else. Thankfully, the plot weaves-in the space politics and keeps your attention. It presents a lot of that messianic text in ethereal settings: dreams, distant voice-overs and flash-forwards. Leaving the primary action to focus on the back-room intrigues and political upheavals.Generally speaking, it takes the established source material, but paints it with the Villeneuve brush. The movie has that visually sleek minimalist style, where heft is rather communicated with sound. Those are the same ingredients that made Blade Runner 2049 a good movie. In many ways, this movie is more of the same, there is not much innovation stylistically. On the other hand, why change a winning formula?My only caveat is: You have to love sci-fi to like this. Your typical Grandma will not enjoy this.","

Dune," Majestic !
",kelvynchin,16-Sep-21,"Dennis Villeneuve's Dune (Part One) is an epic and glorious version of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi, and fully deserved to be seen - more than once - on the big screen. The sets, FX and production design are majestic, the storytelling strives for (and for the most part) achieves mythic scope, and it is truthfully a story that unfolds unhurriedly. Timothee Chalemet makes a good Paul Atreides, and there are great supporting turns by Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson and Dave Bautista. Zendaya makes for a radiant Chani, and the thunderous middle eastern laced percussive score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the overall feel of the pic. An instant classic, although I did find some of the action sequences a bit too dark. Here's hoping Part Two gets greenlighted.","

Dune," Almost perfect, great sci-fi cinema
",h-20587,19-Sep-21,"This is a fantastic realization of Frank Herbert's DUNE. It was a wise step to only cover half of the story of the novel, given how dense and rich it is. This movie also is dense and rich but the 2.5hrs fly pass you like that. Never was I bored with anything, being fully immersed in the rich visuals and sounds. Actually, the 2.5hrs were not enough to give every character the same focus and narrative development but this might've been impossible with Villeneuve's distinct style of giving everything enough time to breathe. The beating heart (and the narrative focus) of this movie are Paul and Lady Jessica, a fantastic mother-son relation with truly outstanding performances by Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. The movie is almost perfect, it however begs for a Part Two in order to see the rest of the story and themes brought to their conclusion. What it does though is tell one specific part of the novel in full, and that is the resolve of Paul's inner struggle - and it's heartbreaking beautiful. With DUNE Part One we have a great achievement in sci-fi cinema and if you're able to, and feel safe as regards Covid, go and definitely see it in a movie theater.","

",bertrandborn,19-Sep-21,"Before watching the movie I thought the many good reviews of the film were fake, but after having seen it... this is hands down one of the best films of recent years!Superb visuals not just in terms of CGI but the graphic storytelling via retro archaic style of buildings, atmospheric settings and lighting and soundtrack, stylish costumes, spectacular desert landscapes and retro high-tech machinery, great cast and acting, clever story with intrigues and political backstabbing all work extremely well together.This remake is one of the few exceptions that by far outguns the original on all levels, and is sci-fi cinema at its best!Only negatives are: the movie's a bit drawn out in the end and could have been 15mins shorter. The ""he's the chosen one.. oh but he doesn't look like it"" mantra is a repetitive and a lame cliché - it's unnecessary to mention it and the story would work well (actually better) without random people constantly saying it. Also, the characters are a bit flat and linear and could have a lot more depth or controversy to them, indicating their motivations, inner tensions, what drives them etc. - so far the characters seem a bit like puppets on autopilot.But all in: amazing and potentially epic film and looking forward to part 2.","

Dune," Dune part I - Masterpiece
",Fil-sorokins,28-Sep-21,"Just finished watching Dune part one. Just As Denis Villeneuve said , that this movie must be watched in IMax on the big screen.When I first heard about Villeneuves new project Dune I didn't know what it was . So I went to the Book store and bought first 3 books about Dune.I can say that I became a fan almost instantly.After realizing how good the 1965 Frank Herbert Dune really is , I hoped for Villeneuves movie to be as good visually and story wise as it was written in the books. And I was not disappointed.Every actor fitted their character. They felt real. Paul Atreides / Lady Jessica / Duke Leto Atreides / Baron Vladimir Harkonnen / Gurney Halleck / Duncan Idaho / Stilgar and Chani. Every actor was casted perfectly.Visually Dune was stunning. CGI was on the highest of levels. The experience of watching 2021 Dune in the cinema is beyond unreal.Still have the Hans Zimmer soundtrack playing in my head. The Theme is perfect. It completely take you and puts you in to the Arrakis where you fight for the survival every second.When the credits started rolling I understood that this movie was just too good to be called just movie.. Its an experience..
Really would have stayed and watched the part II right away)
And at the same time I was so happy that They divided the first book into two parts. That helps not to rush and gives all the necessary details to the audience. So we can understand every aspect of the story.The last thing I wanted to say.. Don't listen to the haters. We all remember what they said about Blade Runner 2049.. Films like this don't just come and go. Dune is here to stay.Go and see it yourself) it's worth it!Now We are waiting Mr Villeneuve for part II !Thank you for the Dune!","

Dune," One of the best movies I have ever seen. Seriously.
",Jason24321,20-Sep-21,"We all know Villeneuve is an incredible director. Blade Runner 2049 is perhaps one of the finest movies of all time. In Dune, Villeneuve once again demonstrates that he is a directing genius. Dune has been widely considered to be one of the most difficult book adaptations. With much of the story told through exposition, such dense lore, and the magnitude of the universe, many believed it was unrealistic. They said the same about Lord of the Rings, but Peter Jackson proved them all wrong. Villeneuve has done that with Dune.Everything from set design, to costumes, to choreography, to effects, to score and sound, to (and especially) cinematography. Villeneuve does a masterful job of pruning the unnecessary exposition to focus on the core story, telling it in a dense but expertly timed two hours and 35 minutes. My wife, who previously fell asleep in Blade Runner 2049 and has never read a Dune novel, was rapt. I, who have read 15 Dune novels, was rapt. Villeneuve has somehow turned Dune into a movie with mass appeal, while staying true to the source material and giving fans everything they could have ever asked for.Villeneuve took the bold action of writing ""Part One"" on the title screen to ensure audiences understand that this is the first part of the book; but also to perhaps place some additional pressure on Warner Bros. To green light part part two. It will be an egregious injustice to the universe if Villeneuve is not granted the right to produce the second part of this movie.I watched this in IMAX and cannot recommend the experience highly enough. The soundscape was awe inspiring. I will be watching this a second time in IMAX.This movie is 10/10. I have extremely minor nitpicks which are not worth mentioning. Villeneuve has cemented himself as my favourite contemporary director and I look forward to watching anything and everything he should create in the future.","

The movie is great. Cinematography and acting is very good. The atmosphere is really immersive. Scenes are intense and fun. Its a really cool setting and it made me really invested in the story. I'm really looking forward to experiencing the rest of the story and I hope Dennis V. Gets green light on making chapter II into a movie.

Dune," Faithful retelling of the book, perhaps too faithful?
",alexanderlunenborg,18-Sep-21,"Dont get me wrong, the movie does everything right in bringing the book to life. The visuals are gorgeous and Frank Herbert's work is clearly understood and respected. But there is something slightly off, cant really put my finger on it. While the attempt David Lynch made (Dune, 1984) was a bit too out there and the filmmaker took too many liberties, Denis Villeneuve (Dune, 2021) was perhaps a bit too determined to not make the same mistake twice.Ive read the book a few months ago so I was still perfectly aware how the story develops. This made the film, dare I say it, a bit on the slow and dull side here and there. This was, like I said, more than made up by the gorgeous visuals and sounds, but I cant shake the thought that the story could have been told in a slightly more energetic way.All in all, a small complaint, and people who are new to the franchise, which I suspect will be many, perhaps do not feel that way. In the end I left the theatre more than satisfied, so still a 9/10 for me.","

Dune," First successfully made ambitious movie in 20 years
",stephane-372-906609,18-Sep-21,"Finally a movie comes up with a high budget, an ambitious vision and a real originality in all cinematographic aspects.Far from the Disney/Marvel imagery and ideology and away from any kind of current-day stereotypes, it is a pleasure to watch a movie with its own aesthetics and narrative.It would be irrelevant to compare to the book. Let's appreciate this movie for what it is, i.e. The original work of a great director reaching even greater levels here. Denis Villeneuve may have started a masterpiece that has been missing to the cinema world for along time now, with both an impossible adaptation of a reference book and a capacity to demonstrate that cinema is still an art that can reach masses with high quality and subtlety.I wish this Dune movie a great success that will open to the next parts of it and write a brilliant and needed page in cinema history.","

I have never been able to get to grips with the Dune universe because the previous adaptations simply could not make me understand what this world is all about.That has now changed and I haven't had so much desire for a second part since Lord of the Rings.And the best thing about it is: no comic relief, no overplayed characters. The film is very adult and therefore refreshingly different from the other current Star Wars like Movie rubbish.And I don't understand the people who complain about the ending. I think the film stops at exactly the right place and makes you want more. And I thank the director for taking the time to calmly introduce us viewers to the world.I really hope there will be a second part, I can't wait.","

Dune," A perfect adaptation of half the novel
",thenecroposter,20-Sep-21,"This movie is very, very faithful to the book it's based on. Naturally, some things have been distilled or adapted out, but they are rather minor and not (in my opinion) relevant to the plot or the characters. The story takes its time unfolding, and the viewers can immerse themselves in the world and the circumstances or our protagonists. Cinematography and score are amazing. I was absolutely floored by the magnitude of the visuals (some elements were, I think, borrowed from the 1984 adaptation) and the perfect soundtrack. The acting is great. The pacing is great. It's a complex story that needs room to breathe. I just hope that it's successful enough to get a ""Part 2"". I love the original novel and, despite the fact that I have a special place in my heart for the 1984 movie and the SciFi miniseries, this adaptation is by far the best, most faithful, and most visually dazzling.","

Dune," CINEMA IS BACK!!!!
",vicrknudsen,18-Sep-21,"It has been one year and eight months (approx.) since the world went into lockdown and cinemas closed, and studios postponed hundred of releases. During this pandemic, there have been ups and downs concerning the reopening of cinema, and with a little luck, some movies had a limited run in some theaters last year, moreover, some films going directly to streaming services. Now, the situation in Denmark has been very different compared to other nations, but luckily our theaters opened for good in May 2021, the films began coming back. Though I really liked movies such as ""The Green Knight"" which I saw in the cinema, there hasn't been one film in a long time when I have thought: this is a masterpiece; this is cinema. Until now.""Dune"" is a masterpiece. It is first-class movie making and one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had. Not only did Villeneuve manage to adapt a story into a film that is supposedly impossible to make, but he also did it with excellence. ""Dune"" is an epic in every way. Its grand production design and world-building take ones' breath away from the first glimpse of the desolated planet. The visual effects are jarring and completely emerge into the real set pieces to make a realistic depiction of a future world. Costumes and make-up are creatively put together and adapts an impossible atmosphere to the story. ""Dune"" is just a stunning-looking film.Villeneuve's masterful direction is one thing. Another this that is as good, and maybe probably is my favorite part of the film is Hans Zimmer's score. Though Zimmer's career, he has made iconic scores to numerous huge and influential films. Music that can stay in your mind for days, and you can listen to and feel you're in the world. What Zimmer did with his score for ""Dune"" is simply out of this world. It's instrumental with choir and big ass drums and horns that will blow you up from your seat. The atmosphere he creates is unbelievable and never gets boring or in the way of the story. Zimmer uses tricks to mix sounds into the score, so it feels supernatural to see the big actions scenes and not think ""Hmm that's a good score,"" because you don't notice it because it's so deep down part of this film. He will and surely deserves to win an Oscar for his work here. It's just been released on Spotify and other streaming services so if you can't wait, go listen to it.Villeneuve has before taken up almost impossible projects and made them work. His vision for ""Dune"" is so compact and tolerable that I couldn't see anyone else's creativity affect ""Dune."" Every aspect he put in play with the characters and the way he wants to move the camera is incredible. His direction is first-class movie making and quite possibly his best work next to ""Arrival."" It feels grand and epic in the same tone as ""The Lord of the Rings"" feels humongous in its character gallery and universe.The story is rich in characters, and all the actors do an equally great job embodying each person. Timotée Chalamet, as the lead, Paul, does an amazing job portraying this ambiguous hero. Though his character for some part of the film is mostly held back because of his father (Oscar Isaac), Paul learns much about leadership and why the planet of Arrakis feels familiar to him. Isaac is a scene-stealer every time he's on screen. He's such a likable character that easily could have been a clichétic menacing-king with his only desire to rule and gain power. His performance is beyond what I expected; he's terrific.Rebecca Ferguson also gets better and better in every single film she does. I loved her in ""Doctor Sleep,"" and in ""Dune"" she shows a more quiet and subtle yet powerful performance. The rest of the cast is bloody amazing. Everybody could be a stand-out alone, and reminds me a lot of the character depth there is in each of the fellowship members in ""The Lord of the Rings.""Was I excited for ""Dune?"" Absolutely! I can't wait to buy it on Blu-ray and dive into the story again. My girlfriend, who loves epic sci-fi/adventures told me that it has probably become one of her favorite films. Though it doesn't fall into my top 50, I can't do anything but give it a top score. What ""Dune"" manages to do cannot be seen through. And I have missed it. I have missed it so damn much to feel engaged and to be fed with a story with so much flesh on. To relive the old days of cinema and to look forward to a new and exciting adventure. I'll be seeing ""Dune"" again sometime next week. Hopefully, a second movie will come because this IS only part one. Don't expect to be fully satisfied. This is only the beginning.","

Dune," Like foreplay, not for those looking for a quick thrill
",robinalers,27-Sep-21,"Dune isn't the movie that any of us expected (especially not the ending). But the original story is so grandiose and long, that telling it in one sitting would be too difficult. One could argue that two movies might not even do the story and works justice.Anyway, this is not the epic movie that people expected beforehand. Yes, it was visually stunning with fantastic sound design (including music) and great acting. But it was not the action packed movie that you might have expected from the trailer, the first movie adaptation, or even the book. Is that a bad thing though? Not in my opinion.It sets a great tone and much like the characters in the story, you feel trapped in the situation. Even before they leave their home planet, Paul and his family (especially his dad) seem to be aware of the fact that their hand is forced and that their house is in tremendous danger. That ""trapped"" feeling never leaves you and only becomes stronger as the movie progresses due to its scenes and tempo. But that means it ""lacks"" in the blockbuster action (though it is there).To sum it up:
Dune is like foreplay. You have to be able to enjoy the continuous tension and the lack of a climax.Those who love that, will love Dune. Those looking for a quick ""bang"", will not.","

",jgardiner86,22-Oct-21,"The film is visually spectacular and if anyone is asking if a remake was necessary I'd say yes just for the technological advances there have been. We finally get a real feel for these locations, something that neither the original nor the mini series can offer to 2021 audience. Anyone unfamiliar with the book or previous versions may find themselves a little confused about the different groups and planets etc as not enough time is spent developing those aspects. People may also be disappointed to realise it's only the first part of the story. The cast is pretty solid with a few underutilised, but the visuals are what give this the 8 stars, that and the fact I am a fan so for me I wasn't confused by any of the plot. Fans of Dune will want to see the continuation of the story, I'm not sure however how good a job it does of winning over new audiences or those previously unaware of the franchise.","

To the folks that bang on about its pacing, return to the meaningless mire of the MCU. Epic films of the past built slowly and that is the nature of Dune (the novel) itself. You are voices in the wilderness clearly evidenced by the ratings and pro reviews. Revel in unending swill of superhero nonsense and just stop going to independent films and rare cinematic masterpiece. You will never be pleased by auteurs, so stop shouting in the wind about that, which you know not. As a devotee of Dune, operatic sci-fi and high fantasy, I was certainly ready to be disappointed, particularly after Bladerunner 2049, but I was wholly immersed by Villeneuve's triumph.

Dune," A masterful accomplishment
",richard1974,17-Sep-21,"This is the movie all of us Dune fans have been waiting for the past 55 years! Denis Villeneuve said this was the project which he had been dreaming of since he was a kid, and he finally accomplished it. Many people thought a movie adaptation could never capture the intricate details of the plot with all its political intrigues and the richness of the world Frank Herbert created, and earlier attempts haven't been this successful. This movie however, brings the world to the screen as I always imagined it.I loved the cinematography, the imagery is stunning. The contrast between the mist of Caladan and the dust storms on Arrakis is characteristic. Wide shots of desert and rock are so vivid you can almost taste the sand and the spice while watching.The opening with Chani narrating about Arrakis draws you into the story, but it might have had some more action in the beginning of the movie. The dreams of Paul are returning several times. Action scenes are alternated with contemplations and explanations, which makes the movie feel like a long exciting dream. All the main actors have done a great job, especially Timothée Chalamet. I don't know why the character Piter de Vries was left out, but all the other characters are portrayed very well.Of course this is only part one, so the movie has an open ending, but I can't imagine someone not wanting to wanting to see part two after watching this.

In fact, the film is quite beautiful and very carefully and well-presented so that anyone, familiar or unfamiliar with the original works can understand it and gather the main story. What is lost, is some of the lesser story and with it, Dune's foundation.No studio could really, or should have ever, really, thought that such an expansive work could be covered in one or two installments or films or that a budget allotted for two films could ever cover what the true telling of the Dune works would entail.If I had to guess, the remaining chapters will be renegotiated into two more films. Anything less, would leave out way too much. Plus, if this is their first offering, they know they have an audience for it now.","

Dune," A science-fiction epic that takes its time setting the stage and rewards you with a rare visual spectacle that needs to be seen on a big screen!
",AdamantiumLive,20-Sep-21,"I got out of the film about an hour ago, so the impressions are still relatively fresh. However, I don't think that anything can shake my almost entirely positive view in the near future. The biggest compliment I can give right now is how new and original it feels. Right from the first minute it sucked me into the world of Dune. It was like witnessing the birth of a vast new film universe that wants to reach out to its audience and be discovered.You can tell that this is only the first half of the book. Everything is set up at a slower pace and you get to know the different parties and characters first. As someone who has neither seen the book nor the film from 1984, I say: If they only spend half the time, shortened or sped it up, the events in the last third would not have had the same effect. The key moments carried a lot more weight and I noticed how I was able to empathize more with Paul as a person, especially towards the end.On a visual level, this film is outstanding, and I've rarely seen one where the full experience was so closely connected to the big screen. The camera shots are just gorgeous and I almost got tears in my eyes finally seeing such beautiful science fiction since a long time. Everything felt so grand and the cinematography is on point. Especially the sequence in which House Atreides travels to Arrakis is absolutely epic. There is also the sound design that completely utilises the capabilities of the Dolby Atmos system in my cinema. I'd say it was perfect for my taste.Explosions, the sandworms and spaceships were appropriately loud, but small nuances are never lost, everything is properly mixed and dialogues are always understandable. Meanwhile, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack thunders from all speakers at the right moments and emphasizes the visual spectacle. You can tell that this is one of his most ambitious projects, it's also one of the most experimental soundtracks of the year. There are beautiful, melancholy sounds, in other places female singers sing in their highest voice and sometimes hissing voices whisper ominous texts.The only real flaw is that the film ends. It is an ending that is untypical for a blockbuster these days and asks the viewer to think about the development of the characters over the course of the story again. If you don't know that this is only the first half of the story, I can understand if you end up a bit let down in the credits.

It would be a crime against cinema if it gets never made due to potentially lower audience numbers.","

Dune," The hour has come
",lelya_fantastka,19-Sep-21,"What should I say? Today we watched Dune...and that was a deserving, profound, noteworthy movie since ""Dark Knight"" directed by Christopher Nolan.Denny Villeneuve made a great work, I didn't read the original novel of Frank Gerbert, I even didn't play a famous game. Today I just bought ticket and went to the cinema and felt the most thrilling feeling I have ever faced watching movie over the previous years. That was a feeling of something breathtaking, impressive, staggering - the movie is consistent, sustained, it is like a candy that you are removing from the wrapper. We can see very slow, unhurried narration, a little bit depressed and pathetic, where nothing impressive happened during the whole 50. Despite this the viewer is passionate about the storytelling, carefully observing events.I can't notice only the actor's work of Timothee Chalamet, he is very progressive, organic in a pair of Rebecca Ferguson or Oscar Isaac, but he fits in the role of nervous, asthentic young heir of Astreides House perfectly ideal. I am not afraid to say that this role is one of the most serious and dramatic in his acting career.I wanted to add my admiration to the music was written by Hans Zimmer. We listened his music in a ""Pirate of the Caribbean"", The ""Last Samurai"", ""Dark Knight"", ""Interstellar"" and others but his music in ""Dune"" is absolutely unusual, unrecognizable, with bright arabic notes, seasoned with ""spice"". He opened in front f his fans from a new side.I have missing for Jason Momoa and his role of brave, strong, honest and hearted warriors that is why I was keen on him in the role of Dunkan, and I regret about his character. No matter how he became a new Shaun Bean.In a conclusion I look forward to the second part.

Dune," Way too good
",nije-mala,04-Feb-24,"I never liked SciFi much - I kinda liked Star Trek, and only Rogue One of all Star Wars, other than that this genre was never my cup of tea (Fifth Element being an exception to the rule).I saw original Dune in theater way back when, and it left me pretty unimpressed, in spite of star-studded cast (Sting was there, for God's sake!) very much like every other movie with lasers, starships, interstellar monsters, and all the paraphernalia of the SciFi. Science Fiction literature, on the other hand, is my cup of tea, and to read Asimov, Lec, Clarke, Herbert et al. Was my favourite pastime when I was young, even to this day.We need to understand, first and foremost: Dune IS NOT SCIFI - and that's why I love it. And that's why people who love SciFi hate it.Denis Villeneuve is a genius, I said that in my reviews of Arrival and Blade Runner, who uses the frame of Scence Fiction to tell the story, and he does it so magnificently. Villeneuve's Dune is an epic worthy of Frank Herbert who also used the future to tell the story much bigger than what appears on the surface - Herbert made you think, understand, dig deeper, so does Villeneuve.This is one of those perfect movies where everything is just the way it should be: acting (not a weak spot), script (screenplay based on one of the greatest novels of all time was not an easy task), cinematography (Mr Fraser, the true craftsman), costumes (notice how unflashy and nonscifi they are), music (thank God for Mr. Zimmer), and all that under the baton of Herbert von Karajan of the movie arts.It was a pleasure watching Dune, I can't wait for Dune 2.","

Not just the characters feel sometimes a bit too one dimensional, the story also lacks certain details of the novel that made this book so extraordinary.In the end it is a abitious adaption of an almost unadaptable book.

I must admit I was most disappointed. To someone watching the film with no knowledge of the books I think it would have been most confusing. My main complaint was the actors' diction. They all seemed to mumble and unfortunately the edition I watched had no subtitles. Parts of the book were left out and the whole film did not run smoothly. It is a huge book and I understand the need to split it into two parts, but surely if they are doing this they could at least keep in some of the more important parts. The special effects were good as were the costumes. The acting was OK but to be honest I preferred David Lynch's version from 1984,","

In the end, I decided to go with 10 stars, as it is a magnificent adaptation of the book and it is a vastly better adaptation than the highly flawed Lynch movie from the 1980s. The reason I'm having a small debate is, that it's only a half of the novel, waiting to be concluded in a next movie, which is something I truly hope will happen, as Villeneuve's Dune deserves to be completed.Dune is a tremendous achievement and a first movie in ages, that has managed to leave me speechless. It is a massive epic in every sense of the word, leaving you craving more. It's definitely a movie you need to watch, as Dune really rises the bar to a whole new level.","

I really really really hope we get at least a second one and if that's the case and Villeneuve is able to stay at this level of quality it could even get better than this one because the second half of the book is EPICAll I can say is that I trust him 100% with Dune from now on.Dune (2021) 10/10.","

Dune," Lame, colourless adaptation, uninterestingly acted, gassy and dull
",Groverdox,16-Dec-21,"Frank Herbert was a guy who stumbled upon a brilliant idea, completely failed to bring it to life on the page with his total lack of writing ability, and yet was rewarded for his efforts anyway when his book became a resounding success.I can't imagine how hard it must have been for him to write it. He could barely string a sentence together, and utterly failed to make multiple sentences flow. It must have been painstaking for him to write, and it was certainly painstaking to read.And yet it became a bestseller, and did for sci-fi what Lord of the Rings did for fantasy. People really don't ask for much when it comes to talent in writers, do they? Tolkien is another example. And Thomas Harris. Perhaps people read so rarely that they don't expect to find the writing engaging, and so don't notice when it isn't.""Dune: Part One"", the movie, is about as dull and lifeless in style as the book was in execution. There is even so little colour to its images that you may as well be watching a black and white movie. It doesn't even have an arresting look, for all the money that obviously went into it. And the actors are boring: what does Timothee Chalamet do, but look wan, pale and wide-eyed? And Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista? Jessica was really the protagonist of the novel, a strong, female character before that became a tired cliché. And Baron Harkonnen was a pretty cool villain. Here the actress who plays Jessica is boring, and the always dependable Stellan Skarsgard is barely on-screen as the Baron.I often considered turning off ""Dune: Part One"". It was so boring and was never able to grab my attention. I stuck with it for some reason. Maybe because, for all its faults, at least it kept up a pretty good pace, never spending too much time with its wafer-thin characters. So I made it to the end. I shouldn't have bothered.","

Dune," It certainly feels like ""Just the beginning"", but by God am I ready for more
",TheVictoriousV,03-Oct-21,"I am confident Denis Villeneuve's Dune will go down as the definitive screen version of Frank Herbert's revolutionary novel (as with Greta Gerwig's take on Little Women; technically the latest one of many, but undoubtedly the finest).We all know the 1984 David Lynch version and how fate was unkind to it. Some will also be aware of the previous attempt by Alejandro Jodorowsky, as documented in the film Jodorowsky's Dune, where the concept art by H. R. Giger at least eventually gave us 1979's Alien - this particular Dune adaptation was ultimately lost.Now, we have what's possibly the ultimate Dune film, and its director has been exquisitely selected, having previously expanded on Ridley Scott's Blade Runner in a way that made the world feel larger, without forgetting the themes and internal rules of what it set out to adapt. (I know a certain other science-fiction/Fantasy franchise that's been having some trouble with that; it was about stars going to war or some nonsense.) Granted, had Villeneuve truly been free from Sony's influence when he made Blade Runner 2049, we wouldn't have had Rick Deckard's involvement spoiled by the advertising.As for Dune, the world of its source material indeed feels more awesome in size - and intricate in detail - than in the 1984 film, and Villeneuve's knack for imposing visuals and atmosphere, resulting in that sense of interstellar awe that good science-fiction ought to bring, remains untarnished. He understands the sheer otherworldly potential of cinema, better than many other blockbuster-makers.Hollywood can render new CG worlds, ""cool"" creatures, and idiotic action scenes starring Black Widow to their heart's content; they will always seem cartoony and predictable without the right shading, weight simulation, framing, and sound design. It looks and feels as if we've entered a distant moment in mankind's future, where the sights are truly new and humbling, yet our proclivity for conquest, fanaticism, and imperialism remains the same - they're not just dangling Cybertron or Lamentis in front of the adult babies' faces.That being said, I admit there are some things that seem studio-imposed for the sake of juicy PR, including race- and gender-bending of various characters. The reason given by Warner Bros is that reworking those characters served to complement their roles in this universe; to better mirror our own peoples, or perhaps predict their fate. I understand the book was partially inspired by Middle Eastern culture and Islamic scripture, and that white-washing the ""Fremen"" in particular might've weakened its impact - and, for lack of a better term, its relevance. My only issue here is with the cringey reactions from the Usual Journalists.This is to say nothing of Vanity Fair's Generation Z-friendly reporting that Timothée Chalamet's character will be akin to Greta Thunberg if she was, and this is an actual quote, ""a Jedi with a diploma from Hogwarts"" (which several droning stans probably think she is already). I don't know that Dune ever panders to the little activists quite so embarrassingly, but the article surely turned some heads. This is what matters.Speaking of actors, the film features a myriad of Hollywood stars, all of them seminally cast in terms of both appearance and skill. Chalamet now plays Paul Atreides, Oscar Isaac portrays his father Leto (the Duke of House Atreides and the new head of the ""spice-mining"" colonies of Planet Arrakis), Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica, Zendaya is Chani, Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, Jason Momoa is Duncan Idaho, Javier Bardem is Stilgar, Charlotte Rampling is Gaius Helen Mohiam, and Stellan Skarsgård (gloriously) plays the beastly Baron Harkonnen.There's also Dave Bautista as Harkonnen's most trusted nephew and David Dastmalchian as Piter, the ""Mentat"" of his house/planet. Many of these characters barely get an introduction - which is one of many ways that Dune feels exactly like what it is; the first half of the first book.Of course, not everything in the film feels ""new"". We've naturally been to the world of Dune before, albeit a cornier version of it. Some images and themes bring Star Wars, Mad Max, The Chronicles of Riddick, and Oblivion to mind (note that the Dune books predate these works by a minimum of ten years), as well as previous Villeneuve pictures like Arrival and the aforementioned Blade Runner (there are even some visual call-backs to his first masterpiece Incendies).But it's the sense of scope he brings to these visuals that make them feel truly alien and intimidating, albeit maintaining a human element (i.e. The many great characters and their roles in the system) that makes this future seem believable; a world where computers are banished but we've discovered the ""spice"" that may make our meaty brains surpass the computational power of machines. There is a sense that we've come a long way, possibly much too far.","

",feliasolling,18-Sep-21,"This movie was like nothing I've ever seen. It's most definitely something else. Strange in a way. You have to be prepared for a very different type of sci-fi and all in all movie experience. It was incredibly intense, engulfing and detailed. It was slow paced in a way, but all the while something was happening. It was beautiful in a cold and barren way. I really liked it and was completely captured by the visuals in particular.Very excited to see where the story will take us in part 2.","

Dune," I lasted 43 minutes...
",durham100,18-Jul-23,"And then gave up. I felt like I had started the movie in the middle and had missed the set up or I was watching a sequel without having seen the first. Nothing happens. It is so boring. I get slow burn, I get epic, I get cerebal sci-fi but this isnt any of those - it is simply boring and pointless. I dont care about the characters, I don't really care about the story as, as far as I reached, there wasn't one. It looked okay but again, nothing out of the ordinary compared to other big budget sci-fi films. I get people are loyal to the book and there is a devoted following but how people can throw around words like ""epic"" and ""masterpiece"" and""genius"" etc is, I think, wishful thinking as this movie is none of those. I would normally criticise people for reviewing a movie they have not fully watched, but if I feel how I do after 45 minutes then I'm afraid that's a bad movie. A massive disappointment.","

Dune," A hard movie to review
",alexfolkesson,30-Sep-21,"Dune is a hard movie to review. As an adaption, it's perfect. However if you're going to judge it by itself, as it would be an original story, the score would be different. Dune relies on its sequel as the book is > one book. This becomes very apparent in the phasing of the story as the structure does not fit in the one movie. But as an adaption, Dennis Villeneuve could not have done a better job.The visuals are good, not as amazing as Villeneuve's Blade Runner sequel, but good. The acting was good, the only issue is maybe Jason Momoa because of his big brother type character that feels forced, almost Disney-ish happy go lucky to make the movie more funny. This movie takes itself very serious, but when it tries to be funny the humor falls flat, however the movie tries to be funny in very few moments. The blame for Momoas force character is also not the actors fault, but the screenwriter.If you are a fan of the book, then this movie will be amazing. But if you have not, I think the feeling of boredom or the thought; ""when is this going to end"" is going to pop up in your head. It's a hard movie to review as it relies on its source material and it's sequel, but a good movie nonetheless.","

Dune," Epic cinematic masterpiece
",UniqueParticle,25-Oct-21,This is one of the best IMAX experiences I've had with an exhilarating soundtrack that flowed so well! I'm glad I got to see this with a good friend named Joe he's great to be around. Anyway Denis Villenvue directed such a wild ride that enthralls you from start to finish and I would say there's no complaints Dune has everything you'd want in it! I think if anything I'd say I don't understand why so many people get up during the movie there was a big audience a portion of which got up often I'd much prefer being prepared to see everything. I loved Dune worth every penny.,"

Dune," This is only the beginning!
",knbrates,15-Sep-21,"I must admit, I still believe ""Frank Herbert's Dune"" to be unfilmable. I realised that, watching Dune: Part One in my local movie theater today. That's why people who have read the book should see this movie adaptation as a single piece of art.Forget the book while watching this movie. Dune, the book drives on the thoughts and inner emotions of the characters - the things that are left unsaid. Visually, that can only be adapted to a certain extent.Villeneuve has done a better job than anyone could ask for. I think he had to compromise on not bringing even more details to the movie, considering that the majority of the people will not have read the book. The information overload would have been difficult to follow for most.This movie is definitely slow, so if you are accustomed to constant dopamine stimulation then you might find it boring.The visuals in combination with the sound/music are hauntingly beautiful and will stick in your mind for a long time. I got goosebumps almost throughout the entire movie.Dune: Part One definitely serves as a stepping stone for Dune: Part Two, and more to come...
If you are looking for action, Dune: Part Two is definitely the movie to be waiting for. So grab some friends and go watch this movie.Make ""Dune: Part Two"" happen.This is only the beginning.","

Dune," Great looking but without depth
",Bonobo13579,26-Mar-23,"I'd been meaning to read the book for years and with the film coming out I thought it was about time to get into it before watching this.Having read it, I can see why it was deemed unfilmable. So much of the plot is held within character's internal monologue and very complex political interactions. Unfortunately while the film looked great and was faithful to a few of the scenes, it failed dreadfully to bring any depth to the story. There is no background to speak of with any of the characters who appear and disappear as quickly as they came. From this point of view it has to be seen as a failure, both for people who have read the book and find it lacking. And those who haven't, who either won't get it at all, or will see some weak mystical Matrix / Star Wars type hybrid.Disappointed with this, I think I'll seek out the series.","

It manages very well to pull off the balancing act of begin a tendpole movie and a immense creative undertaking, so shortcoming of the storytelling are easily forgivable. It all feels a bit like a very high value TV Series, but that's actually not a bad thing.

Dune," Epic in every sense
",beno-11,29-Sep-21,"Dune is an instant classic; IMO the greatest sci-fi movie of this century, among the best movies of all time. It does pretty much everything right. It's close to flawless. The visuals will leave you breathless. They are overwhelming in their scope, detail and vivid clarity and I'm not talking about pixel resolution. Dennis simply sees the unimaginable, fictional worlds in distant future with vivid, intricate, multilayered clarity. It's a rare, super special gift he possesses. All of the characters carry mystery, depth, sensibilities, strengths and insecurities and they feel incredibly relatable. You feel them, even in their most surreal circumstances.Visual effects, spectacular locations, set designs, music score...this movie maxes and crashes through every metric. The story is vast. VAST. 2.5 hours are needed to establish the perimeter of Dune, rough outline of the characters, the hierarchy, the game itself. You're left wanting for more. And wait we will. 10/10 from me.","

Dune," To Tell The Truth, I Am Not Impressed
",denis888,31-Oct-21,"Well, where to begin here? Long, very long movie of a very slow pace, with very dark and gloomy lights, very dour mood and very depressing feeling overall. It produces a rather sour taste and this sand sees to ooze everywhere. Timothée Chalamet is OK, but he is not yet the star to save the whole production. Other more mature stars, like Rebecca Ferguson or Oscar Isaac seem to be slightly better off here but the whole plot does not allow the to be beyond very tight frames which stifle them a lot. Zendaya or Josh Brolin are so limited in their screen time that it is almost null and void. Maybe, Jason Momoa is the real winner here with his bright and powerful prsence.Generally, the aftertaste is dour and sour and leaves no desire to wait for the second part, as the unbearably slow tempo of the first part and dark brooding atmosphere produce very limited wish to persevere.I'd say I am not impressed. Surely, this one is better then the awful 1984 version but still leaves much too much to be desired. To tell the truth, this is not my Captain speaking.","

",BenjaminNieuwenhuijzen,20-Sep-21,"Going into this movie my expectations were insanely high. And I must say that I came flabbergasted out of the cinema. I watched it in IMAX with my girlfriend who had a tough time getting into the movie for the first 30 minutes. I did not, but I did some research about the characters, plot etc without it being spoiled for me too much. I've never seen the original movie so I don't know how well it compares to this one, but I got to say and I quote: ""This is the best sci-fi that I've ever seen in the cinema"" WOW what a movie! From the details to the way shots are being filmed to the cast to the acting to the story and even the music, Everything is spot on! I've never seen anything like it. The only reason that I don't give this movie a 10 is because there is no ending. This is very much a ""Part One"" so don't expect to get a movie that comes full circle at the end. It leaves many questions unanswered and I can't wait till the time that they (if they ever will) bring out part two.","

Dune," The meh combination between Game of Thrones and Mad Max 4
",dakuchonekobing,10-Mar-23,"I am one of those people who have never read this novel. Maybe Dune fans are always waiting for great things from the book to unfold before their eyes, so they will tend to want to overrate this movie, and I understand that. I was overwhelmed by the monumental scene that the film built in nearly 1 hour from the time the movie started. The architecture of the houses and costumes of the characters are really attractive. So beautiful. The music is also great. Hans Zimmer did it again. He's a genius. The sound is also unique and engaging. That's right. The sound of the spacecraft's engines, the sound of the laser guns from the defensive bunkers,... I think these surpass the Star Wars series. And Rebecca Ferguson, well, I love her acting. The production design is truly top-notch. Couldn't be any better.But if we take out all those flashy things, what do we have left? A troubled story between outer space clans, a clan purge, a surviving boy. That sounds great, but everything turned out is so lacking in depth. Towards the end, the climax decreases and I just want it to end as quickly as possible. Big worms in the sand? Meh~ it's not scary at all. Too many slow motion scenes, the visions of the psychic boy, Professor X? Meh~ too many, too unnecessary. Aquaman, appearing as a bodyguard, rushes to sacrifice and leaves nothing of value? Meh. Set in the future with many spaceships, and these people fight each other with knives? Meh. The Atreides family massacre really ruined my expectations, it looked like a failed version of 300 or Tron Legacy. And the boy was chosen for no reason, easily winning the strongest warrior at the end of the movie? Meh~ And his mother watched, enjoying the battle. Jessica's mind development is great at first, but by the end of the movie this also falls apart. And the mysterious Dr. Yueh too, maybe they should let him speak Arabic instead of Chinese. Are we watching a movie with an Arabic vibe? Yes?Perhaps my satisfaction stayed in the ""black library"" scene where Paul's fear was tested, which was my only favorite scene. The rest makes me wonder if I should wait for Dune Part 2 or not.","

Dune," Too slow, very unfocused and missing important parts
",abisio,26-Sep-21,"Denis Villeneuve is not a bad director; but has a really pacing issue. Most of his movies like The Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 over welcome their stay. Both of them could have been far better with some minutes less and more focus on the main story.DUNE makes exactly the same mistake; most of the movie is in David Lean mode (Lawrence of Arabia) with too long takes on the desert, on the rocks or deep dramatic and profound looks of the main characters. Adding to the agony; the very confusing dreams or visions; and about a 1000 takes of Zedaya digitally enhanced blue eyes; there is very little time left in the two and half hours to complete properly the story. Solution; trust people to see the older movies, the tv series or read the book and take out essential parts. The Baron other nephew (Feyd), the Emperor and his daughter or transport union creatures are nowhere to be seen.The conflict of interest is barely explained in a few lines of dialog; the Duke achievements with the Fremen are not given any importance.A friend of mine, not familiar with the above, ask me what was happening and who were some of the characters; so do not expect to understand most of it if you are not familiar.In the acting department; Chamalet is fine but he does not look as a rebel fighter; more as a scared young boy some mother issues. Fergusson however is very good she even survives her many many face close-ups.For those who complained about Lynch's 1984; in this one story is the basically same but with slower pace. Lynch made a more compelling first part in 60 minutes with far easy to understand and with more character development than the 150 minutes in the new version. The only noticeable difference; the insinuation of some complot from the Bene Gesserit with Jessica involvement.Last but not least; while the visuals are too spectacular; action scenes are not and with little or not emotion.In brief; better visuals but not much more than the old movie and the series.","

Dune," Dune , masterpiece of modern movie making
",jagesara,19-Sep-21,"Review of ""DUNE"". Part One. Newest blockbuster of director Denis Villeneuve (from ""Bladerunner 2049, Sicario, Arrival, Incendies""etc). And what a successful attempt to bring the book alive on screen. It's magical, mystical and mysterious throughout every scene. The music is an important participant in creating the right atmosphere for the viewer to understand the time and the circumstances. And music director Hans Zimmer has delivered plenty. The year is 10191, people are living on all kinds of planets. However, human greed has not changed after so many centuries, still no healthy evolution there. The hunger for power, colonialism and superstition is still part of the world. Daily life has blessings and challenges. The struggle to hold on to good values in ethics is real. As always the game between good and bad is started with planning, with a little seed and a lot of hope. There are several stories, all part of the big one, intertwined in brutal action, philosophical conversations and fearful experiences. Some have to die, to save others, for the greater good. Some have to be born to lead the way, for who? Are they fanatics, are they truthful or is this just some insane human interaction of trying to become Gods/Godesses? Villeneuve has thrown quite some questions and it's not easy to find answers. What/who is really good, can we question someone's motivation, cause good and bad are never crystle clear. Can prophecies be manufactured by careful planning ? And is the obvious mistake overlooked, the things we can't control. If we take a look at the scenery, the desert itself is an absolute entity that can control, break and devour humans. At the same time it provides ""the spice"", making humans addictive, dependent and always ready for war ! Whoever possesses the spice, will rule the world. It's the major asset in the galaxy that can determine life or death. And still, humans can't find a way to work together and have the best of all that is provided by Nature. This is to me the main plot of the story. Those who join hands , in trust and friendship, can go a long way. They can enlighten others, be a role model and maintain (world)peace. When this doesn't work out it's for a simple reason, ""the level of perception"". Not everyone understands what has to be done or what has to be not done for the greater good. Only a simple reason and explanation: the big ego. That's why Paul Atreides, who is to be the great saviour/hero, is tormented by all the visions and actions. He can foresee the outcome but is never sure that it will really happen this way, because he's still learning about his powers. He's such a good child and student, tries his very best, but understands only half of what is happening in the world. So sometimes he gets devastated with every setback. At such a young age he already has to fight powerful enemies. Will he live up to the prophecy, become the great protector, or will he change the course of his fate and fight his way through all the battles he dreamed of ? Will he find the love of his life, will Love be part of the blessing? When one has so many burdens in life, it's mighty hard to bring back peace and understanding in the world. We'll find out in Part Two ! Villeneuve has really stretched his talents this time, in adaptation, in a high-level storyline, in music, in the amazing casting of the characters (Ferguson, Momoa, Isaac, Brolin, Zendaya, Bardem etc) and in making us feel what Paul feels (despair and hope). Entertainment, multi action-scenes and excellent performances. Must See !!","

Lawrence of Arabia this isn't. The dialogue is stilted. Some of the acting is outrageously bad.

Dune," A modern fantasy epic
",gijsbrans,19-Sep-21,"If you're deciding whether or not you should go see ""Dune"" in cinema: you definitely should go. It is not often that a movie telling a story on this scale is this good. It's often described as sci-fi but I think that fantasy is a more appropriate description. After, all, we're not dealing with technological and scientific developments and ideas here, but instead with an empire, arisocratic houses, magic and cultures, only it takes place in space. Being the classic story that it is, I don't think I need to go into detail about the plot. Villeneuve has succeded tremendously in the worldbuilding of this movie. It sets up the plot and the world it takes place in perfectly, and shows us hints of traditions and cultures at the same time. This all makes the universe feel much more believable. All that is set up leads to epic confrontations, only strengthened by the amazing acting of all cast members and by Hans Zimmer's epic score. It all makes for an experience that truly feels like it was made to be seen in cinemas. And through all that Villeneuve still manages to be close and personal with his characters. This truly is a modern fantasy epic, and a must-see for for anyone who enjoys a good cinema experience!","

Dune," A MIXED ADVENTURE
",Snootz,19-Oct-21,"I'm not going to take the position of a ""Dune Fanboy"" who believes a Dune movie can do no wrong. This version suffers from a poor choice of actors. Leto does not have the screen presence of a Duke, Paul does indeed look like a boy and I'm sorry... that's just not Lady Jessica. Duncan Idaho was better portrayed than any other character and really, seemed the only heart and soul in the entire film.Deviation from the original book is okay; I expect such in a movie. But this deviated needlessly, in ways that had me yawning. Presentation was poor. In a major battle scene the suits worn by the Fremen and Sardukar were so similar it was difficult to tell one from the other. The sandworms are not nearly as impressive as prior movies. Many vital dramatic points of the book (and prior movies) were left out, which cost a great deal of essential character.I was disappointed to find out it was Part 1 of (what 2, 3, 4?). There was nothing in the trailers that indicated this would be a multi-year series. Gah. This wasn't a ""slow burner""; it was a fizzle. In this day of superb CGI in even the most basic films I wasn't impressed by the ""special effects"". There was far too much time spent on trivial drama without nearly enough focus on key plot elements.What was most missing in this version is the heart that made Dune such a masterpiece. The plot moves more slowly than the Baron, and in the end it was simply disappointing. I expected far more from a movie made in this decade than those made 21 and 37 years ago. Another reviewer mentioned this was very much like the TV miniseries created in 2000. I have to agree.I don't demand constant action/adventure in films, especially in a cerebral classic such as Dune. But I did expect some directing skill in both screen adaptation and directing. We're disappointed to find neither in this rendition. It's a shame to wait so long for a film, only to find the anticipated blockbuster is yet another mediocre attempt at bringing the impressive world of Dune to the main screen... and not all that different from what has gone before. I think that's what surprises me most is that it isn't significantly better than it is. They should have titled this ""Dune Retro"".","

",ilikeimdb,23-Oct-21,"I was hoping Dune 2021 would more rigorously stick to the Book's plot and bring alive Herbert's detailed story in a way the compressed / compromised Dune 1984 could not. Instead D2021 glosses over or completely leaves out major plot points, changes key aspects of its characters, makes up new plots when convenient, or simply repeats certain scenes from D1984 with nearly the same dialog but without the necessary context. D1984 also has significantly better acting. Zendaya's acting is so flat the EKG wouldn't register. Timothee Chalamet's acting is similarly flat and uninspiring: For his Paul Atriedes, Spice is salt and very mild pepper. D2021's truly beautiful CGI can't compensate for the fact that no one watching the film cares one iota for the fate of any of its characters. Sad.","

It's so immersive , it really feels like a created universe.The run time is long which is good, it means they can get as much as possible in with fewer changes to story which is inevitable with a film adaptation. There are too many idiots complaining of it being too long or others saying they left out certain moments . The director set out to make an adult Star wars and he did it, now if only they can make a red rising series to this quality. Hoping the sequel is green lit.","

The director of this film Denis Villeneuve has so much experience on Sci-Fi films like Arrival (2016), Blade Runner 2049 (2017) so he will knows the best Visualisation for sci-fi films.Dune was super awesome movie and more than I was expected cause there's people said that this movie was boring and make them sleep.From the movie was started I was really really shock surprise about the visual and the cinematography, So beautiful so perfect and bonus Zendaya and Timothee face they're both are so beautiful and handsome. With this budget this movie was so epic and boom for the visual,CGI,cinematography and more. There's a scene that makes me kinda shock when Paul voice change into super scary voice.I know in the middle of the movie it's kinda boring but the audio and the visual of the picture or the beautiful scene of this movie makes me enjoyed the movie and didn't make me feel sleepy at all, cause the storyline is very slow.But i feel like we need more minute's or times for this movie cause the ending was make me super curious, when the movie was end I was like ""what?! I need more"". Hope the sequel will be more epic more beautiful visual, and perfect like this movie.There's to many people die in this film, why Jason momoa die I thought he will alive and be together with Paul, and that one girl from Fremen. For the violence there's a lot of people die and get burn, blood when Paul see future that Zendaya kiss him and then stab him with a knives.I thought that Zendaya will have more screen time but she just get screen time in the ending of the movie. Zendaya with blue eyes it was so cool, can't wait to see the other epic movie from dune, the sequel. For opening film for dune series this movie was so good and have a detail of the story, but it was kinda complicated and little bit confusing me.

",samratsingraur,19-Sep-21,"What we are witnessing is the birth of a mythical cinematographic saga which differs from the pretentious blockbuster sagas by its depth. Denis is a genius and he was able and knew how to take the time to set up a universe this astonishing and beautiful. The worldbuilding I just so perfect that it seems entering a real historical event in another universe. And for the aspect, the shots are grandios, magnificent landscapes which transcribe the atmosphere of Dune so well. The storytelling is done wonderfully. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is so surreal that it accentuates every aspect of this complex mystical universe. The performances are incredible. An excellent casting indeed especially Timothée as Paul.Dune is not just a sci-fi movie. It's an art. An art that needs to be witnessed. It's exactly what cinemas are made for. Spend your money on this. Watch it in theatre. Can't wait for Part Two.","

Dune," Watch it in best theatres
",vjnambu,29-Sep-21,"I knew about this film when I heard that my favorite composer hans zimmer voluntarily dropped tenet to work on this film and I was wondering what's great about this. Then i read that its based on a classic sci-fi political novel which gave inspiration for star wars and game of thrones. Then its lineup of ensemble cast also made me curious for this film two years back. Then covid came and i stopped going to theatre for more than a year. Also this became wb same day same date release date for 2021 so, i was looking forward to see it at home. But when it released this week in my country, I thought to give it a shot in theatres. Hence, dune is my first film in theatre post pandemic.Talking about the film, I was thoroughly engaged and thrilled thanks to hans zimmer's score obviously. Its clearly evident how passionate he was for this film by hearing his score. Sound effects were terrific, which i wouldn't have got of i saw it at home. The cast were great but I was not in awe of anyone except jason mamoa. I felt disappointed of them wasting bautista.Film ends on an incomplete note for a sequel, but I wonder whether we would get to see it in future or not, if it does not perform financially well. We know how wb ruin director's work recently. Also the director should have simultaneously start shooting for the second part too for continuity.On the whole, watch dune is a must watch in theatres. Find a best theatre near you and witness this masterpiece.","

Dune," Scenic, fantastic, edge gripping
",christiandela,20-Sep-21,"I was expecting a lot to be honest, but it has delivered beyond that.Scenic and fantastic worlds are build without CGI being the first thought that comes to mind.The space part of the narrative is not something that fills up the time.The music is maybe the most surprising part, it is really really good.Without trailing off in details of script or story telling, it really isn't a story that builds to a single climax or fix point, it just delivers edge gripping narrative for 150 minutes.I need to upgrade my Hi-fi for when it becomes available and I am looking really forward to part two!","

",smnambiar,24-Sep-21,"A cinematic experience. The sound design and music was one of best highlights. The sheer scale in which the movie was shot was highly commendable, the way it should be. Among the performers, Rebecca Ferguson was the best followed by Timothee.I think they should not stop with Part-2 and need to convert all the books in the series to cover the journey of Paul Arteides.","

Dune," Some scifi movies look and feel awesome, some dont...Dune is merely a mediocre attempt at being awesome and failing at it miserably...
",imseeg,21-Nov-21,"I had high expectations for this movie, which was made by the same director that created ""Bladerunner 2049"", which DID look and feel like an awesome scifi classic. Unfortunately Dune fails at being excellent in many categories...The bad: the leading actor has little to no charisma. Just my personal taste. But besides him, even the other (good) actors look out of place and even look a bit silly (Josh Brolin). That's really annoying, that the acting isnt up to par for what should have been an exciting dramatic scifi epic.More bad: the entire look and feel of this movie is rather mediocre and kinda cheap. The visual effects (from the very start) are NOT impressive at all. They look really cheap. Nothing like the terrific special effects in Bladerunner 2049.Even the music, the editing, the photography, all those technical details which can lift a movie up to the stratosphere, are all quite mediocre. What a disappointment.Even more bad: I hate it when there are voice overs that constantly start explaining to me what is happening in the story. Too many characters and periods in the story have to be contineously explained to me as a viewer by this irritating voice over. I dont mind if I dont understand everything I see, I dont need a voice over nanny...Not any good? With so much money, time and potential available to make this movie, I felt really disappointed, that this isnt even near anything like other classic scifi movies.Not terribly bad, simply mediocre. And when it comes to epic scifi movies I really hate mediocrity!","

",vifargent-70931,22-Sep-21,"Intriguing and mysterious story, this adaptation seems to honour the book (i dont' read it, but i'l do it in a near future). Someone even tell me that it's hard to transcribe on a big sceen. On a first tier of the movie, it's difficult for someone who never read the book to understand the universe, but the pieces of the puzzle come together on next parts.Actors are pretty good, and the cinematography, phenomenal ! The pace of this movie up crescendo, with well placed pauses between two action scenes.This movie may become as important as Star Wars IV: A New Hope.And dont' forget, this : it's only the beginning.","

Dune," An Arresting Cinematic Experience
",lareval,18-Sep-21,"'Dune' is a stunning, gourgeous looking Sci-fi Epic that faithfully adapts source material into the Big screen with class and craft. Villeneuve shows why he is a masterful filmmaker. This movie deserves to be witness in the biggest screen with the loudest sound system possible, not on TV. Because of its impressive photography and scenography. Because of the scoop of its ambition captured in widescreen shots. Because of a gargantum score by Hans Zimmer that will stay with you long after listening it. It has minor flaws: some characters are more glorified cameos without a proper storyline. But with all the things that could have gone wrong with this movie, that's a flaw easily forgettable. And this is world so Big, so ambitious that as Zendaya says closing the movie: ""This is only the beginning"".Warner, don't be stupid and make Part II as soon as possible. I want to see how this story goes further.","

Dune," DUNE - dead serious Sci-Fi
",Mik0rist,26-Sep-21,"Denis Villeneuve's DUNE has Campbell's monomythical framework storytelling structure. In fact, George Lucas used this model to build the stories. It has been redesigned to have the simplicity of the Story Circle. That's why almost everyone has the impression that they watched ""DUNE: A Star Wars Story"". For this reason, Greig Fraser as Cinematographer was deliberately chosen. If I had never read the book and I new nothing of Dune I could miss the opening credits and watch this film thinking it was a new Star Wars movie and I would be completely none the wiser.The story is so adapted and simplified visually that a wide range of people can follow it, and further spreads the impression by words of mouth and camp in the front of the cinema.This is a global phenomenon. It's incredibly viral. It affects.The result is not to impress us who know the book by heart. Than to become a very viral film for a wide audience. It was made with the intention in advance of breaking the Box Office. But they didn't count on a pandemic and a be shown on HBO. This is the visual bible of Dune's book. And let's say the first 300 pages literally. Denis explains more with pictures than with words. This is the experimental exercise of cinematography. There are many parallels with George Lucas' way of expression, but Ridley Scott influence on ""world-building"" is also clear.The film can literally be watched on MUTE and get to know the plot. Like a silent film literally. A similar feeling as with Odyssey in the Kubrick universe. The film is dead serious in the same way. Too serious for my taste. There are no jokes in it at all. There is no slang and bad language either. It's not a movie to watch with popcorn. You don't have to blink here to be able to absorb all the visual information. The disadvantage is that those who are not concentrated and rested can fall asleep in the cinema because they cannot process all the densely compressed information they receive.","

Dune," Totally Brilliant!
",martimusross,18-Oct-21,"DuneJust got back from the unlimited screening at Cineworld of Dune, a truly gargantuan movie at 2 hours and 35 mins.After a disappointing Bond and a tepid continuation that was Venom, this movie totally nailed it. I thought it was totally brilliant and we are at the start of a new fabulous franchise, a story we have waited for over 30 years for someone to make a decent fist of!It was merciless if you had been living under a rock and had no clue what Dune was, difficult to believe but it happens. It was dark, moody, complex, with a multiplicity of characters and layers of meaning and intrigue. Of course we had the three set pieces for the fans, the gom-jabar, the assassination and Duncan Idaho, and these did not disappoint.This movie was so brilliantly paced, dwelling on the characters during internal conflict and then rushing forward with the action.The two things that make this movie a classic of our time, the micro gestures and styling that stamp this movie as something brand new, the second is the masterful editing, we moved from inside Paul's head to Jessica's and back again.The casting was inspirational in putting Rebecca Ferguson (not a fan) and Timothy Chalamet together, they totally clicked and Mr Villeneuve really got them to act their socks off! Of course much was missing, but there is no rush as this can be included in the next part and it seems sensible to have some measure, as it was it was an exhausting watch.Special mention must go to the scoring, it set the scene and was inspirational, this is an obvious Oscar in 2022.Whilst controversial Timothée Chalamet is perhaps the most charismatic actor alive today (Tom Hardy is my number 2) there is nothing this man cannot do and here he delivers in spades. I have read some remarks that Timothee's acting is merely proficient or perhaps nothing special and can't understand the ""fuss"", in response I would refer to the layered nuance of the Bene Geserit test, we went from irritation, to burning, to pain, a physical manifestation, alongside shock, defiance then resignation, an emotional manifestation, all at the same time in a three minute section of the movie. If you think this is pedestrian you try it in front of a mirror.I find one fault with this movie so it's a 9 outta 10 from me, to gender swap and racially rinse Liet Keynes, a much loved and established literary character, for no other reason than a political statement will always be unacceptable.","

Solid performances from the entire cast as well. Storytelling: it starts with a bit too much exposition and world building (perhaps a novel like Dune is more suitable for a series, like Game of Thrones) but once the action kicks in, it is a great rollercoaster ride.

",akcenat,28-Aug-23,"Dune (2021) is a visually stunning but ultimately forgettable adaptation of the classic science fiction novel. The film boasts impressive production values, with stunning cinematography, intricate set design, and epic special effects. However, the film is let down by its slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional resonance.The cast is also a mixed bag, with a lot of miscasts.In short, Dune (2021) is a visually impressive film that is ultimately let down by its slow pacing and underdeveloped characters. Fans of the source material may find some enjoyment in the film, but it is unlikely to win over new 'believers'.Rating: 6 out of 10 stars.","

Maybe it's because my expectations for this remake to reach the heights of both masterpieces were low, but despite it, i have found the movie to be visually beautiful, and to manage to transmit the soul of Dune, something most remakes fail. Some important scenes from the book are of course missing, I hope some will be shown in a director's cut. Overall a good surprise, and worthy of the Dune name.","

Dune," Lord of the Dune sand
",kosmasp,01-Dec-21,"I just reviewed the 1984 movie - based on the same source/novel. As I wrote in that other review: I have not read that book. I did watch the ""original"" movie to have an idea what Villeneuve did. Denis Villeneuve is a director who I adore a lot. His weird and very strange movies that are like a punch in the gut and warrant multiple viewings to understand are one thing - but he has proven that he can also do blockbuster movies too.Like this one - there is not much left from the campy feeling of the first one. There may be some things still here that people may feel offended by. But in this day and age it's impossible to do something without sparking outrage and trigger at least one group or the other (whatever side of the spectrum they belong to).While the camp is gone, the movie is also much clearer. The original needed a monologue in the beginning and even that muddled things up rather than made them clearer. What both movies have in common is the cast in front of the camera is superb to say the least. While the original had issues with the costumes but even more so the special effects, this one thrives in both. Excellent work, from everyone included.I chose the summary line because this may very well be one of the best Science Fiction movies (larger scale that is) to date. No offense meant to any Lord of the Rings fans of course. Rather meant to be a compliment. Like the Rings movies this also is supposed to be a trilogy if I understood what was being said right. The thing I know is that we will get a sequel. When this hit cinemas, it was only called Dune. Now it is Dune Part one. And I am happy to say the least to come back and revisit this world. If possible on an Imax screen again of course.The scale of the movie is immense and while there was one annoying bag pipe moment (you know who you are!), the music/sound design and the cinematography worked hand in hand. I can only recommend this so much - if you are into Science Fiction movies I am quite certain you will like this too. A friend of mine who has read the books loved this too - so there seems to be no one who is excluded (apart from those wondering about who takes their clothes off - there are statements that are beyond my understanding - on the other hand they may be trolling so there's that) ...","

Every frame we see on screen is an artwork in itself and the way every scene is shot makes those alien worlds so much more believable. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer once again elevates the movie even further while the acting ranges from decent to outright great. Those two and a half hours flew by in no time and by the end you are hungry for more. It's a shame we may have to wait for a few more years to get a part two, but once it comes I'm sure we'll have one of the best Sci Fi movie series of all times on our hands.","

",GeneralHail,21-Sep-21,"I saw Blade Runner 2049 in the cinema as well as Sicario. I loved his (D. Villeneuves) work so far - as I read that there will be a new Dune - I was already hyped for it. Saw the two trailers and thought this could be great.I watched it last week in the cinema - it is just great. I loved the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, the actors that were cast for their roles are superb, Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho kicks ass, the whole implentation is well done. I didn't even recognize Javier Bardem! Maybe it was the blue eyes, I don't know haha.I wasn't in the cinema since Tenet from C. Nolan, but I'd definitely say that this movie is worth it. It was made for the big screen. Unfortunately it ends so sudden, with such a build-up and tension - that I can tell you I can't wait for the second part of it and I already ordered the first book - because to my shame I never read the books, I'll start while waiting for the Part II.","

Turns out I was right on the money.I've been interested in reading the books, since they are regarded as classics. Fans praise the setting, the mood and the rich lore. But I have never heard any praise for the characters or the actual story. Having watched two failed (or are they really?) adaptations, I suspect that the actual story isn't all that interesting. The characters (a generous use of that word) certainly aren't, especially the wooden boy in the lead.At least the first movie took camp to a ridiculous level. But this installment is just pompous and dreary. Just because it's slow doesn't automatically make it profound.","

",christianaabyorellana,28-Sep-21,"I put down a 10 to counter the stupidity that is reviewers that put down a 1 or 2 on this movie. Those same reviewer surely gave The Lobster and Dogtooth a 10, talk about snoozefest. Just because something is slow and complex, doesn't mean it's good. I would say, go watch it and make up you own mind.With that said, Dune would've done better with some more complexity.Dune had its best moments with Rebecca Ferguson when it came to acting. She didn't really fit in with the rest of the characters, but her character had me intrigued and interested the most.I will give Talamet a pass, since his character must have been heavyly directioned by the script and director. And he is a good actor, to say the least, but his character didn't really have me as hooked as the Lady Atreides character. He was missing something and I suspect that something had to do with the screenplay and dialogue. It needed more philosophy.What I would say added to the runtine must've been the overly excessive flashes of the future or possible future. And at times I found myself feeling like I was watching a raw cut. Alot of time went in to showing us some amazing landscapes and great views, but even that became overly excessive at times.The story overall was great and would've needed 2 more hours to capture the entirety of Frank Herbert's sandworld in this Part 1. But seeing how movies work, that would've been impossible. Maybe making a mini-series would've been better for the stories sake, but then we wouldn't have been able to watch it in the cinemas.All in all Dune delivered a great experience and has to be watched in a cinema at least ones.And like I said before, don't listen to all these hipsters that enjoy 3 hour dramas in the cinema, but miss to enjoy a intriguing and beautiful movie which didn't miss by much at all. So go to the cinema and make up your own mind.","

After 2 1/2 hours, there isn't one character to care about. There is no chemistry between any two characters and the story is glacial in its development. What makes the disappointment all the more is that the quality of the cast is right up there. Sadly, the script and development of the story is awful (when one can understand what is being said).

",lenpannett-136-973682,04-Jun-22,"I really wanted this to be a good film. I wanted to enjoy the story. After all, I'm a sci-fi buff and love the saga type of tale. What we have here is simply boring. To be sure, the visuals are amazing and designed for cinematic viewing. However, that's all this film has going for it. After 2 1/2 hours, there isn't one character to care about. There is no chemistry between any two characters and the story is glacial in its development. What makes the disappointment all the more is that the quality of the cast is right up there. Sadly, the script and development of the story is awful (when one can understand what is being said). Halfway through and I just didn't care for any of the characters. By the end of the film, I don't care if there is a Part Two.","

Dune," very overrated
",fear_is_nooption,17-Dec-21,"A good movie makes you feel something interesting or makes you think something interesting, or teaches you something that allows you to grow as a person, or makes you think something that then causes you to feel something interesting.Or any combination of these.This is also true for anything you enjoy, were it a book, a lecture on a science topic, music, anything at all in this world that a human might enjoy has at least one of those traits i mentioned.This movie had non of those traits at all for me, and from what i read for alot of others.","

It probably took me 4 hours to finish. The story just couldn't keep my attention. Every 10 minutes I'd have to rewind and re-watch the scene just so I could follow the storyline. I honestly couldn't wait for it to end. Not a film I'd watch again.","

Dune," A Masterpiece and a phenomenal adaptation.
",jamesstucker,11-Sep-21,Haven't been floored or thoroughly transported by a film since The Lord of the Rings until now. Dune is thrilling and emotionally authentic. The best part about the movie is that it takes it's audience seriously and does not just traps them into a cinematic odyssey but also takles the storyline critically.Performances are incredible especially Oscar Issac and young Timothée Chalamet. The movie is itself captivating and the visually breathtaking cinematography is God like.,"

Dune," A Review For The Readers Of The Original Story
",daniel-a-1998,18-Sep-21,"After a long wait - when the film was actually supposed to premiere in October last year - Dune hit cinemas in Sweden during the week. I just refreshed my memory of the original story when I finished reading the book a second time before the cinema visit.Taking on a story with as much weight and the scale that Dune has is no easy task. But with what the Canadian director already has in his luggage, Denis Villeneuve seemed to be the most suitable man for the job when he took on the project a few years ago. With the results in hand, Dune is absolutely massive and an almost unbeatable cinematic experience when it comes to the pure scale of the picture. The trust in Villeneuve has paid off.The scenes are epic and magnificent and the soundscape is huge. Hans Zimmer, who composed the music and constructed the sound, has polished his creation so that the bass tones make every single bone in the body vibrate. It is noticeable that he is a big fan of the book since he has worked beyond the ordinary with this project. Zimmer combines heavy drums and bass lines in all frequencies with almost religious voices to create something unique. When ships fly past the camera, it is difficult not to get goosebumps.Timothée Chalamet is in my opinion one of the best actors of my generation. I already know that he can act but Dune is proof that he can shoulder the greatest of roles with bravura. The entire cast is right for their roles. Stellan Skarsgård as the evil baron is a great antagonist and the mother Jessica's emotional bond with her son is beautifully portrayed by the Swede Rebecca Ferguson.Dune does not follow traditional film structure but is quite similar to the book. I think the film will appeal to the fans of the book more than the usual cinema visitors as the exposition at the beginning of the film is fast-paced and the story is complex and often throws itself with terminology that many people may not have heard before. The film also does not leave much time to breathe for the viewer to digest what happened as all the scenes are eventful and important for the story. If you take a toilet break, there is a great risk that you have lost yourself in the story when you return.With gorgeous design and many practical effects, Dune is visualized how I experienced it in my head when I read the book - and not many book-based films succeed with this. The atmosphere is deep and grabs you easily. I think it was very helpful that they filmed on location in the desert in Jordan because the heat and thirst really gets to you. Beautiful environments and great detail - what more could you want? Dune is a very good film adaptation of a very good book.","

Dune," I'm still figuring out if it's a masterpiece...
",MesDeCupy,25-Sep-21,"Where are the bad reviews?? I can't find them, everybody seems to love this movie. Me as well, I think it might be the best in the last two years, and it will probably stay that way for some time.Dune is an epic sci-fi fantasy art work, and Denis Villeneuve proves again that he knows how to craft an enormous picture around an actual simple story. For me, 'Dune' talks about the difficult responsibilities a young heir apparent must face when his family, or his House, House Atreidies, gets involved in a huge political game between other houses concerning the distribution of territory and spice, a special resource, on Arrakis. Most characters are portrayed very subtle and without any excessive actions. For me, that way of creating character and depth works, some people may find it a bit difficult to connect with. Rebecca Ferguson stood out the most for me, I think her performance is worthy of an Oscar nomination.It feels very slow at times, and at times a little too slow. I like Denis' style, and it's not as slow as Blade Runner 2049, but because of the general pacing in this film, there were some moments when I would have liked it a little shorter.Technically this film is outstanding.... The production design is AMAZING!!! Costumes, sets, scenery, etc. They were all perfect for me! The cinematography is beautiful, not as good as Roger Deakins' work with Denis, but still top notch. And then Hans Zimmer... he does it again. Not his best, but how could he? He's already made some of the best scores ever. It's a little too ambient for me at times, and I would have liked the vocals to be a little more present in the film. Other than that, it's musical perfection, no complaints!!!I want to talk about one more thing, the style of Denis Villeneuve. Denis is a filmmaker who makes his films on a basis of world building. The best example is Blade Runner 2049, the whole film is one big exhibition in the gigantic universe created by Philip K. Dick in his novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".For me, that's when Denis is at his best. But I missed a bit of that, it felt like Dune could have felt even bigger. The whole time it felt like we could have gone a little further, just a little bit.I realize now how bad my review sounds, I'm just pointing out some things that bothered me a bit. I love the movie, and always will!!! I'm still figuring out if I think it's a masterpiece, but for now, I'll leave it for discussion.","

Dune," Awful
",drjgardner,03-Nov-21,"Two confessions: (1) I thought the 1984 version was wonderful. (2) I watched it on a 65"" TV. My assumption about TV was I would screen it on TV and if I loved it as much as the original, I would go to the movies and spend the $. About 10 minutes in I was really bored. Acting is terrible. Not just poor, but terrible. Everyone was terrible. The ""special effects"" are certainly unimpressive. Especially considering it's 2021 not 1984. Then there's the music, which is so poor you probably never thought about it. And worse than anything else, the direction and the photography are film school level. There is nothing in this film that appealed to me. I stopped watching after 30 minutes.","

Dune," One of the most interesting films i have ever seen
",aeneaskokkelmans,18-Sep-21,"I saw Dune last night with a friend and altough we both havent read the book, we were blown away. I loved every single second of this movie, i have never seen visuals this good ever in a movie, the acting was amazing, especially Timothee Chalemet, that boy is going places, Hans Zimmer's score is beautiful (as always) and a perfect match to this movie.The thing i loved the most about this movie is the worldbuilding, everything is so interesting and georgeous to look at. The machines and equipment they use, the clothes they wear and so on. The concept of everything is just so interesting and different than every sci-fi movie i have ever seen, simply amazing.However, I think not everyone is going to enjoy this movie, it is a slow moving story that takes its time to unfold so you can see more of this world and i love that. All i can say is that it was very different than i expected it to be, but i loved every frame of it.Like I said i havent read the book so i cant really judge the story to much but from someone who went into this movie blind i can tell you the story is amazing and a perfect first chapter to this story, and i am left wanting more so i cant wait untill the second part comes out! Untill then, i am definitly going to read the book so i can know how this interesting sci-fi masterpiece will end.Make sure to watch it in the cinema if you have the chance, you will be blown away!","

Dune," An immersive sci-fi cinema experience to behold
",ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,11-Oct-21,"Dune is an epic science-fiction adventure experience to behold. Director Denis Villeneuve transports the audience inside the epic world of Frank Herbert's novel. It is an intoxicating film, at times overwhelming, that lingers in the mind like a reoccurring dream.Paul Atreides, son of Planet Calaban, accompanies his family, House Atreides, to the desert planet Arrakis to manage the mining for the ""spice"", the most precious resource in the universe capable of prolonging human life, enhancing intelligence and can fuel faster-than-light space travel.A betrayal pushes the House Atreides to join the Freeman, the local desert inhabitants of Arrakis, in a war against the Harkonnens, an industrialized race seizing control of the spice.Denis Villeneuve spends the first 30 minutes introducing the different planets, races and characters. It takes brainpower to keep up with it and remembering all the sci-fi names of who's who, but slowly and firmly all the little details pull you inside the world of Dune.It came like an awakening. I viscerally felt immersed around the 30-35 minute mark when Timothée Chalamet's Paul Atreides catches an object in his hand and I cheered. Just like that, I was in.Before that moment, the commercial film-goer inside me, all corn-fed on the Marvel formula, was throbbing going, ""Where's the action scene? What's taking so long?"" The film calmed that fever down with its slow pacing, ensuring every detail was crucial and every object in frame had a story behind it, which Denis Villeneuve gives the audience the time to ponder on what they might be. Eventually I tuned in and was immersed, feeling like I too was going on the adventure in the desert as well.Greig Fraser's cinematography combined with the production design and costumes, are breathtakingly gorgeous. If it's available, see it on IMAX. There's so much to soak up. It is addictive marveling at all the visual details, if you let it. Even the spice looks so visually delicious that it makes you want to put your face in it and snort it all.Hans Zimmer, a self-professed huge fan of the novel, delivers his most experimental score yet, including inventing new instruments, playing normal instruments differently and creating an alien language to create otherworldly music from another universe.Zimmer's score attacks the subconscious without words and he experiments with what's recognizable to our ears. There's an instance of bagpipes playing over a ceremonial setting that was masterfully jarring that had me discussing with friends the effect it had in our heads.The only one quibble I had was one instance where Mandarin Chinese was used as a coded language and it took me out because I speak it. It was so jarring that I missed the actual plot point. ""What? Mandarin exists in the Dune world?"" That is twice now Denis Villeneuve used Chinese awkwardly in a movie, his first being Arrival. He seems passionate about featuring the language, but unaware how it is playing to its native speakers.Above all the spectacle, what struck me was how Dune tapped into the metaphysical. Paul Atreides' visions call to him, driving him towards his destiny. It's an unexplainable yet compelling feeling and Denis Villeneuve presents it in such an ethereal untouchable way, my mind keeps thinking about it.This is the best time I've had in a cinema for 2021 and I'm rooting to see nominations come awards season. Dune is the anti-formula, the anti-Marvel attempt to deliver a new experience that cannot easily be explained. For me, Dune hits the standard of cinema that Martin Scorsese was talking about.I cannot wait for part two.","

Dune," Spectacular, but without a soul.
",johannes2000-1,17-Sep-21,"I read the book a lifetime ago, so I don't remember the exact details, only that I was pretty overwhelmed by its epic scope. I guess the makers of this movie aimed to evoke the same feeling. And although I was totally ready to go for this, it unfortunately turned into a slightly disappointing experience.Sure, it's cinematographic awesome, the CGI and special effects are top-notch, the settings and costumes are impressive, and the acting by all major characters is great. But there should be more to a movie than ""just"" all that. What I dearly missed was some kind of soul in the story, an urgency for all the goings-on that should have been transferred to me as viewer.What didn't help was the extremely complicated background of the story, that only in (rather incomprehensible) bits and pieces was revealed during the run. Neither did help the fact that none of the characters was even remotely sympathetic, not even Paul, who as the meant-to-be pivotal hero of the story all the time stayed composed, solemn and rather bland.What you get is a mixture of GOT, Star Wars or LOTR, with the same well known ingredients: there are some evil powers that mercilessly suppress; a downtrodden community that rebells but lacks a leader; and a messianic hero that stands up to save the day; all of this covered by the usual sauce of exotic fantasy-languages, semi-religious rituals, some sorcery, and lots of massive battle-forces fighting each other to death. It's all familiar and done before, maybe not as grandiose as here, but in my opinion with a little bit more insight and depth.After two and a half hours I was left with the impression that I had only watched a long, complicated and slightly incomprehensible introduction to The Real Thing. Maybe that Real Thing is already in the making, they certainly alluded to it with the subtitle ""part one"". I do hope so for Timothée Chalamet, I admit that I could watch his face for hours, but I so much had wished for him a more rewarding role to put his teeth in. He really earns a second chance.","

Dune," Stunning movie experience*

Read all the books and played every game for PC.This movie is like a slow cooked delicious meal served with amazing visual effects, great casting choices (a few exceptions of course) and general fidelity to the original dialogue and story (the changes are understandable when switching to a visual media).A few things, however, that lessened my movie experience
1) It suffers from what I call the ""Revenant/Interstellar"" malaise with too many slow ""scenic cinematographic porn"" scenes and protracted slow motion overlayed with an ""epic"" score. Could have easily shaved 20 mins of the movie and made it more easily consumable to the general audience2) Lack of exposition. Yes! For once we could have used more exposition. Why is the spice so important? There are a few mentions, but not to the degree that it deserves.3) Consequently, a few scenes showing the Emperor, the Landsraad, the Guild and the homeworlds (not just the oceans of Caladan, but their architecture, the pollution of Giedi Prime, the splendor of Caitain) to better immerse the viewer in the setting.4) I didn't expect GoT British dialects, but the overly Americanized parts of the dialogue stood out. Not in a good way.And finally
5) I freaking loved the movie, but I had a sense that my non-Dunie friends had a hard time following the many threads and slow plot of the movie.Conclusion:
9/10 for me, but probably 7/10 for the general audience.","

But after seeing the trailers I had my doubts, which were well founded. I was glad I hadn't paid money to see this and waited for it to come to HBOmax. What Peter Jackson got right with the LOTR movie adaptations this movie gets all wrong. The movie is disjointed and confusing. The only reason I understood was because I read the books. I had to keep explaining the way things should have gone to my husband who was bored halfway through. To make a movie like this you have to be faithful and really understand the important things about the story, the 80's version at least understood that. I will probably do the same thing with part 2 wait till its on a streaming service. Too bad, really sad about this one.","

Dune," Poetry!!
",Remy_Azhary,16-Sep-21,"Here's my thoughts on Dune. But first and foremost, I must apologize if I put in spoilers in which I might not realize it or unintentionally. So sorry about that.So with that said...Wow! What can I say!Villeneuve's Dune is definitely way way different from the Lynch's version. It's not as weird or boring as that. Nor was it as wooden or overly-dramatic as the 2000s ScyFy series.The whole experience of it was somewhat, I would say, poetic yet serious in the likes of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy especially when it's augmented with Hans Zimmer's score.I would also like to highlight that there was a tinge of the 2015 Justin Kurzel's ""Macbeth"" where the atmosphere at times felt grim and gloomy. But that's not a bad thing. It just adds to the seriousness of the movie. Speaking of Macbeth, the movie does give off that Shakespearean quality about it which I very much appreciate it; hence why I thought this Villenueve's Dune is rather 'poetic'.Before going into the movie, I was afraid that it be a snooze-fest just as Villeneuve's take on his ""Blade Runner 2049"" despite it being visually stunning. But as a fan of the books, I'm certainly glad that it was far from boring. I don't feel like it is in any way a slow burn as what some reviewers described it. The pacing was just right like it was right out the book. Yet I couldn't say the same for those who are unfamiliar with the story. They might, I worry, get very impatient with it.And not to give anything away or spoilers, there were definitely changes from the source material. In particular, that dining room scene from the book where disagreements were expressed out among the characters was not in the movie. Another point to take note was the use of spoken languages among the various groups which I don't ever recall Herbert used in the book. Such that, they actually took the effort in creating languages to distinguish which group of characters they're from. It was interesting take that Dr Yueh was speaking in Mandarin while conversing with Paul and the latter responded with the same. I mean 'Yueh' is, after all, a Chinese name so I think it's kinda appropriate. I also picked up some Arabic in some of the scenes especially when the Fremens were talking to themselves.As for performances, it is definitely Timothee Chalamet's shining achievement. This is his movie. Rebecca Furgeson also gave her possibly emotionally wrenching performance. There were scenes whereby I could empathize with her pain, not as a Bene Gesserit, but as Paul's mother. Oscar Isaac, too, was compelling and had me convinced that he was good enough to be Paul's father. Collectively, both Isaac and Furgeson played it excellently well as Paul's parents to give him enough care yet with firm sternness to protect their son.The scope of the movie was indeed epic in terms of the scale. For example, the sizes of the heighliners in comparisons to the smaller ships. Those were massive. Think those individual alien attacker crafts in ""Independence Day"" compared to the main mothership, except that the latter was three to four times larger. And those Ornithopters were perfectly made to mimic dragonflies yet upon closer look they do resemble helicopters. The costumes were stunning. So much so that I'd described them as being ""lyrical"", if that makes sense.Hans Zimmer's score is also worth mentioning. It fits the movie perfectly but it does not overpower the feel of any scenes. Although I did find his use of bagpipes to be out of place. And sadly, we did not get to see Gurney Halleck strum his baliset. It'd be interesting to see how Josh Brolin would sound like if he were to sing.For me, personally, the only thing that was amiss was the exclusion of the Emperor since he was mentioned many times throughout the movie but with no physical representation of himself on screen. And as many of us already knew, Feyd was not included in the movie and it did give the strange feeling that the main Harkonnen players were around except for him. Or Count Fenring, for that matter.Yet, all in all, they did capture the gist of the book so I'm not disappointed at all. Dune was a beautifully made film that I wouldn't mind going for a second viewing. And I could certainly see that it would garner quite a substantial amount of nominations especially in the technical categories.","

Dune," A work of art with an otherworldly music and sound design
",m-i-budai,19-Sep-21,"A work of art, the cinematography, the music the designs all beautiful. Two and a half hours that passed like nothing and makes you crave for more. The pacing may seem a bit slow at first, but it blends perfectly into the telling of the story. The characters are well writen and played and even some minor inconsistencies within these characters is overshadowed by the pure beauty of the cinematography and the impressive storytelling. Great Movie. Hoping for Part two soon.","

Dune," ""Fear is the mind-killer""
",underthistree,16-Sep-21,"I was completely floored by the scale of this movie. The sound design is absolutely phenomenal as well as the music and the visuals are close to perfect having several similarities to both Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017) whilst simultaneously being in a league of its own. Villeneuve truly is the master of pacing, as proved by his previous films, and Dune is no exception. As expected, all the actors deliver stellar performances, especially Chalamet and Ferguson. This adaptation of Dune stands alone as a masterpiece, completely separate from Frank Herbert's creations. This is most certainly only the beginning.","

Dune," great movie
",evy-99201,20-Sep-21,"It's an extremely beautiful movie, more slow paced than the average movie but I was never bored. I liked that it took time with the characters. Like Blade runner 2049, it's not for everyone. But you know, no good adaptation of Dune was ever going to be for everyone. It's actually a good sign I think. Let's just say that if Transformers is your idea of the perfect movies, you might want to skip this one but I think most of us know that. Also, the lightning is unusual in the movie, in some scenes. It's all about natural light so if you like everything in a scene perfectly lit and visible it might bother you a little. I personally thought it made the movie look very ""artsy"" (not a bad thing btw)Other than that, music was amazing, acting was amazing, special effects were pretty convincing the sandworms were so well-done! Their entrance was epic!The only thing that stops it from getting a perfect score for me is that I kinda like the most outlandish and original design in science fiction works. This one is very realistic and grounded, but I understand why it was made that way and it doesn't stop it from being impressive and gorgeous. In fact, some people might prefers this more realistic universe, it's a matter of taste. It's such a small nitpick really when compared to the positive elements of the movie.Also, it needs to be seen in theatre, trust me. I can't ever imagine seeing it for the first time on my TV. What a shame it would be! I'm probably going to see it again while it's still in theatre.PS- Looking at the reviews with the lowest score and the users who posted them, it's clear that many MCU fans are salty and trying to get back at Denis for his (very tame) comment about Marvel movies. Really you guys? Did you read the full interview in context? I love many Marvel movies as well (going to watch Shang-Chi next week!), but I thought he had a point and there was nothing I found offensive about his comment. It was not all negative as some people made it sound. Let's not be petty shall we? You are allowed to like both Dune and Marvel.","

Dune," A Modern Masterpiece - Brilliant Direction, Exceptional Visuals, Incredible Score, Great Cast
",rannynm,22-Oct-21,"I love Dune. This film is almost like an introduction to a great story. When at the end Zendaya's character says, ""This is only the beginning,"" the foreshadowing tells me that there will hopefully be a sequel.Dune is an exceptional film directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted from the original sci-fi novel, written by Frank Herbert and published in 1965. Fans of the 1984 version directed by David Lynch - and newcomers to Dune -- will be fascinated to see Villeneuve's incarnation. I absolutely love the cast, cinematography, CGI, makeup and many other aspects of this film.The film takes place on an unfamiliar desert planet, Arrakis - the world of Arrakis is breathtaking. I love the culture of the planet, such as the languages they speak, the homes the characters live in, and, of course, the makeup and costumes have a huge effect on the aesthetic of this planet. The story centers on a young man named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) who has an important role: His family is responsible for mining a very valuable and powerful spice, which is the most precious element on Arrakis. As the story unfolds, it's easy to be captivated and mesmerized into the illusion that you as the audience are with the characters on Arrakis. At times, though, I felt I was almost missing parts of the story. Since this is an adaptation from a book, a lot of information has to be left out, and I left the theater wanting to know more about Arrakis. I also felt that the beginning is a bit slow and most of the action in this film takes place near the end, although that isn't a huge issue for me.Now let's talk about the acting and this great ensemble cast with Timothée Chalamet in the lead role and his peers: Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Oscar Issac and many others. I've been a huge fan of Timothée Chalamet for a long time and this is one of his best performances to date. I love his character - you can really see how at the beginning of the movie he is a vulnerable yet strong boy who eventually stands his ground and knows his place. I also love Zendaya's performance; throughout the entire movie I was waiting to see her appearance. I also love Jason Momoa's character, another one of my favorites. Finally, Oscar Issac and Rebecca Ferguson work really well together and deliver very engaging performances.The costumes are very detailed and intricate which bring out fascinating elements of the planet. And the cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual storytelling is so beautifully done and goes in perfect sync with the production design. It's important to acknowledge Hans Zimmer who composed all the music since his score brings the sci-fi storytelling to life.The message of the film is we all have a purpose, we should find our own voice and destinies and true empathy is as powerful as blood lineage in our world.I give Dune 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX if you can. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!","

",len_o,26-Sep-21,"If you knew as little as I did about Dune in general before you watch the movie, be careful about what to expect. This movie couldn't be more far away from what other Scifi-Epics are all about.This movie - at least to me - is about what feels right and what feels wrong about the things going on in the world. It's about the ambiguity of what is real and what you make of it.Paul envisions glimpses of his (possible) futures throughout the movie. These moments of strong intuition are masterfully staged. Visual- and Sounddesign are breathtaking.Yet if you are personwho requires max clarifaction of the context in order to enjoy what you witness, you might be disappointed.That is because Dune plays in a Universe, in which technology (i.e. AI / Machine Learning) has been ""overcome"" as a consequence of a devestating war between humankind and intelligent machines.Thus we are diving into a world in which people.resigned from the idea that technology drives all progress and evolution. The discovery of spice, a substance that -in a nutshell- elevates the mind, was the enabler for a new path of progress & evolution: A spiritual one.If you are ready for this, you will be delighted.If you need to fully understand what's going on, you might rather not.","

Dune," Great
",ada_singh,26-Sep-21,"That was great! First, I doubted should I watch this movie or not. I had watched most of the Denis Villeneuve's films before that and some of them had been rather good, but the others had been completely awful. Also I was a big fan of David Lynch's ""Dune"" and thought that no one would be able to do better, than Lynch. So I didn't have any expectations on this new ""Dune"", but then it exceeded all my expectations. This ""Dune"" is much better than all the previous versions, very precise in detail and visually stunning. ""Dune"" differs a lot from some other sci-fi movies, because it has a good balance between action scenes and dramatic moments. Speaking about actors, I am very impressed by Oscar Isaac, Stellan Scarsgard and Javier Bardem acting. I am not a fan of Timothée Chalamet, but he was also surprisingly good and organic in the role of Paul. Zendaya was not bad, but I think that the role of Chani is not for her. Maybe the only thing that I didn't like, that the movie was too long and some moments wasn't very important and could be easily cut out. Also it feels like Denis Villeneuve wanted to make a film exactly according to the book and there's one problem that he didn't have enough courage to create something new and original. But nevertheless I am quite satisfied with ""Dune"" (2021) and it is definitely a must-watch movie.","

",cherold,31-Oct-21,"I wasn't a big fan of Dune when I read it. It was like a sci-fi/fantasy take on an old sword-and-sandal political intrigue thing, complete with dull characters and dumb story.On the other hand, it had this wonderfully anthropological creation of a desert world and its people. That was the only reason I got through it.Dune Part One is the first part without the second part. The characters are still dull, the plot still dumb, and the sci-fi world-building almost non-existent. The scenery and special effects are quite good, but nothing is interesting; even action scenes are listless.Will Dune Part Two offer the world-building that was the only good part of the book? Doubt it. Anyway, I certainly can't take any more of this.","

Lovely caste, which accurately conveys this action.The main disadvantage stems from the limited timing, namely the missing arches of the characters, locations and some events that are of great importance in the plot and understanding of the causes and consequences. + Perhaps the age rating has imposed some restrictions. I really hope that the director's version will be released in 4-5 hours, or at least in the sequel Denis will return to these nuances.So you just have to carry your money to the cinema, otherwise all we have left in the future are the endless conveyors of spheroic and the continuation of the Fast and the Furious.My score 9.3.","

I cant say how faithful of an adaptation it is but what I can say with confidence, for movies like this cinema excists. And it should be watched on the bigscreen.Hans Zimmers soundtrack just hammers you into your seat and just like the movie it can be a little pretentious at times but it has every right to be that.Some if not most of the shots in this film are just breathtaking.Its a long movie 2 1/2 hours and for such a long movie not that much happened, but thats because Villeneuve takes his time to really explore this world, its characters and sometimes just for really cool shots.The movie asks for your attention and you really need to give him that.

I was told by more than one person that the book is complicated and the 1984 film made no sense but I would say I understood 80% of what was going on which is Just enough .I'm not convinced Timothee Chalamet had a big enough screen presence to carry of the lead role and sadly the same goes for Rebecca Ferguson. Maybe it's because the graveness of the story made them look so miserable all the time ?It's been confirmed that Denis Villeneuve will be making the second part to Dune but I won't be rushing out to the cinemas to watch it .","

Dune," Slow yet spectacular futuristic Game of Thrones
",kringelan312,15-Sep-21,"Dune has every component a movie needs to have in order to become a blockbuster. Taking elements from grand franchises in series and cinema, the ingeniously bringing together of a memorable soundtrack and slow-paced storyline creates something unique. A slight downside might however be the confusion of different clans and families. Nevertheless, I think such a thing will sort out eventually. Dune resembles tv-series such as The Mandalorian or Game of Thrones and that is not bad at all, since this saga will be split into several parts as well. Denis Villeneuve has brought forth yet another intriguing masterpiece in his collection of movies and he should eventually, if not already, be considered among the greatest directors in Hollywood.","

Dune," Mesmerizing, but Incomplete
",OttoVonB,14-Oct-21,"It's no surprise to anyone walking into Dennis Villeneuve's Dune that it is only part 1 of the story. The title implies a very different kind of missing ingredient. But let's rewind.First, kudos to all involved for, at long last, the definitive screen depiction of Frank Herbert's gargantuan sci-fi classic. Finally, a creative team is able not only to merely hint at, but do justice to a dense plot and long list of players, all while keeping the audience's jaws sagging to the floor throughout most of the runtime. As most other viewers have already mentioned, this is spectacle on a very rare scale, and you would be well advised to view this on the biggest screen possible, in 2D.Dune is the story of a galactic power struggle for Arrakis, the desert planet home to the spice melange essential to interstellar travel. They who control the spice, control the universe. As the film opens, House Harkonen fall out of favor (or do they?) and stewardship of Arrakis is handed to the noble House Atreides (but to what end?). There, young Paul, the heir to the latter house, discovers his role in the galactic chess-game, and his unexpected calling as a futuristic messiah.Upon watching Dune, all the usual hallmarks of a Dennis Villeneuve production are again present and accounted for: top-notch casting, world-building and performances. Whereas the expansive nature of the story initially had me wondering why the decision was made to go with a theatrical project (rather than, say, a generously endowed HBO or Netflix miniseries), watching the Canadian auteur at work, it is clear that if Dune belongs anywhere else than on the page, it is on the big screen. The faults, so far, lie largely with the source itself.The greatest hurdle in connecting emotionally with this film is that Paul, despite total commitment by Chalamet, is hard to relate to once his destiny becomes more clearly traced out. This makes the once controversial decision to beef up the characters of Lady Jessica (Ferguson) and Chani (Zendaya) all the more essential and understandable. Though their actions thus far in no way betray the Herbert tome, they, especially Rebecca Ferguson, become our emotional anchors, and perhaps the film could have weighed this consideration even more heavily.Dune is awe-inspiring, its designs are fantastic, but it is rarely touching, or emotionally engaging. And somehow, Hans Zimmer managed to drop the ball, churning out generic percussion and throaty wails yet depriving us of a single, memorable cue.Still, by rights this ought to be the real post-pandemic rallying cry back to the silver screen, and it is very possible indeed that Part II will even surpass and transcend it.","

Dune," A great immersive and psychological experience
",mimi0108,02-Oct-21,"Visual:
I don't think I've ever been so impressed in front of a movie. The visual of the film is amazing. The attention to detail and the realism of the world portrayed on screen is impressive. I was more than once impressed and gripped to my seat in front of some visuals (especially those related to the sandworm). The special effects, the way of filming and the precision on some details allow a total immersion in the world of Dune. You could almost touch the quicksand with your fingers.The sandworm is definitely the best visual thing I've seen. The realism of the sand waves created by the worm is astounding and gives a real sense of danger and wonder. In fact, the film creates the necessary tension around this creature. I had never been especially terrified or fascinated by the worm before seeing this movie.I also particularly liked the richness of the Fremen universe that this film shows. The different equipments used to survive in the desert make it possible to understand the hostility of the environment as well as why the Fremen are dangerous and particular because they have managed to adapt and live with the desert not just in terms of climate but in term equipments. These are the kind of details that enrich the universe.Sound:
Sound does not have the musical function it often has in films. It is a real prop to immerse the viewer in the universe, underlining an action, a noise and the like. The rumblings, tremors, pulses felt make the world of Dune alive, captivating and make it a real 4DX experience in a normal theater.Story:
The story of the film is very well constructed. The director takes the time to set the scene, introduce the universe and put the characters in their comfort zone before launching the plot. This time given to the exposure of the world and the characters allows the audience to understand the issues at hand, to know the different relationships and what is going on in the minds of the characters (mainly the character of Paul).The film builds a palpable but subtle tension throughout its first arc which leads us to the mid-film climax. The pace doesn't slow down after that. The film subtly and dynamically alternates action scenes with more poised ones. The action is present and well paced without being omnipresent and does not suffocate the audience with endless sequences without emotions. The film is understandable for everyone. It takes the time to present the different political factions and the issues while maintaining a little mystery about some political actors.The ending, although very open, fit with the story told in this first part and gives a feeling of accomplishment of a quest while making the audience understand that nothing is finished, far from there.Characters:
All characters serve their purpose. The ones that revolve around the Atreides are specially well written. Each has their own personality, function and relationship to other characters. The acting combined with the writing allows the audience to become attached to these various characters, to understand them, to have empathy for them and to fear for their lives.The main character, Paul Atreides, is written with a lot of subtlety, complexity and emotion. Everything is done, including the acting, so that the audience understands and sympathizes with this affectionate teenager, still immature and lacking in self-confidence, who is aware he must grow up and try to live up to his position as heir to a Duke. This complicated period between childhood and adulthood is well portrayed on screen. To this gradually comes to add an understanding of his difference. And the audience feels a great pity to see him progressively become someone he doesn't want to be and be thrown into a path he doesn't want to take.Lady Jessica, the film's second leading role, embodies with great charisma and subtlety the mysterious aura of her order. Alternately self-confident, emotional, stoic and badass, she is a complex character that is still a little mysterious but terribly human and understandable. The mother and son bond is also well exploited on the screen.The Harkonnen are not caricatured but frightening and cruel.Conclusion:
Dune by Denis Villeneuve is a very good film, even an excellent film. It is rare to succeed in combining visual, sound and storyline without it being to the detriment of one of these elements. It's also complicated to make an adaptation of a book that satisfies both readers and non-readers. And this bet was successful. Non-readers will not understand everything at 100%, but the film gives them enough to understand most of what it says. The rest can remain a mystery, understandable after a second viewing or when Part 2 airs.After all, when the first Star Wars came out, not everyone understood what the Jedi, the Force, the Emperor and the like were, but that didn't stop us from enjoying the adventure. Here, since the film is intended to be more political and immersive, the audience has a lot more information and explanations.Dune is a real sci-fi rodeo. It is a science fiction movie, a Greek tragedy, an art's movie and a blockbuster. This is an immersive and psychological experience that will not leave the audience untouched.","

Dune," Visually stunning but mostly about setting the stage
",Byron-15,17-Sep-21,"I'm a long time fan of the dune universe. Have read all the books multiple times and of course I've seen Lynch's version. This version is a lot better. Excellent world building, visually stunning and full of star power. It moves slow, which on the plus side gives it the chance to go into detail, but on the negative side means by the end it's not even at the halfway point of the first book. So it ends at the moment the mythology is just picking up. Which made me leave the cinema wishing to see part two, which unfortunately they haven't even started filming.So IMHO the reviews giving this movie a 10 or calling it the movie of the year are overly positive. It's a visually stunning start to a potentially mind blowing universe, but mainly an introduction to that universe. Maybe when the story is finished (wouldn't surprise me if they need three movies for the first book) it will be mind blowing and perfect, but for now this movie is a great introduction to the duneverse. Good, but not great. Yet.","

Dune," I am totally and utterly shocked, not to mention bored out of my mind
",eronzierjoly,12-Nov-21,"I am a huge si-fi/fantasy fan. I have not read the book but I knew I would most likely at least like the film based on what I had read about it.I normally think films don't get enough credit, I will typically complain most films are rated too low. But I honestly didn't get this at all, even though it is my favourite genre. And oh my was this far too long for its own good.I had to fight every urge to stand up and walk out of the theatre. It failed miserably to create and explain the universe in which it all takes place. I kept thinking that this could learn a thing or two from the Lord of the Rings, where you are drawn in straight away by the mysterious/enchanting world and the different people within it.In the case of Dune, not only did I not understand where all these different people came from and what there issues/motives were (or maybe I just passed out and fell on the floor, wouldn't have made a difference as far as I'm concerned).No endearing characters, I can't even remember their names. I didn't care what happened to them nor do I remember their fates as I sit here and write.Nothing interesting about the worlds/planets. There was however a lot of super boring conversation that made me want to choke on my popcorns. I think at least half of the excitement in this genre is to get a feel for the universe where it all takes place but oh my Lord did this not deliver in that department.","

Dune," An Empty Masterpiece
",stevensino,29-Sep-21,"Denis has filmed the unfilmable, he achieved a monumental task yet at the same time it feels like an empty achievement. Bear in mind that I'm writing from the perspective of one who has read the books quite a few times, I know the events and characters and I'm just observing the way its adapted. The film's highest points are when there is action and spectacle, it's grandiose bigger than life and in a cinema it feels realistic. That feeling of realism is present in the books and it was treated well. The sets are all believable we could almost touch them, the most important set is of course the desert and its presence is surely felt. Costume design also follows the same principle of groundedness, it is one of the strongest points of the film, the sight of the Bene Gesserit is simply haunting, the dresses of Jessica are all memorable, and the star of the show is the Fremen stillsuit they nailed it.With such a strong cast we expect very powerful performances and the actors surely deliver, my favourite was definitely Duke Leto interpreted by Oscar Isaac, he plays well both the charismatic leader and the caring loving father and husband. Personally, I did not enjoy the soundtrack, although the sound design is very very effective especially in a cinema. The soundtrack is huge, maybe too huge for my taste I found it quite distracting and it overstayed its welcome. There are different themes for each character or trait (Honour, Atreides, Bene Gesserit, Shai-Hulud) but they were too obvious and very preachy.And so when all these cinematic elements combine they do create an unforgettable experience, but unforgettable for the wrong reasons or more precisely the wrong aspects. I did not see any of the ideas of the book manifested with image and sound, I only saw the images described in the book. The action and even the climax all happen in the background in the book because that's not the pint of the story, while here it's the opposite. Key scenes of character introductions and interactions are taken out in favour of more dreamy sequences and action. This shift of focus made many characters feel insignificant and I never cared for any of them, it's like everyone is a side character.I really appreciated the attention to small details, like the bull painting, desert mouse, glowglobes...
This the best Dune we're ever going to get, it's an audio-visual masterpiece, but it never felt nearly as thought provoking as the book or even as a standalone film.","

You might like the movie if you're the sort of person who watches 3 hour youtube videos of ""oddly satisfying"" patterns, because nearly every shot is done with some sort of symmetry or weird effects.It takes SO LONG to get to the point, the first time anything mildly interesting happens is a full hour in, then there's another solid hour of nothing until the 15 minute conclusion.I just can't get over how many people have raved about this piece of garbage. The characters are bland, unlikeable, and uninteresting. The entire plot is so slow burning that they probably could have filmed grass growing and it would have been more thrilling.Everyone talks about how it's ""unsettling"" or ""psychologically terrifying,"" ok, maybe the last 5 minutes, but the rest is just a bunch of cult people drinking mushrooms and screaming together. It's not unsettling so much as it is annoying. Constant repetitive music, samey scenes that all play out the same way.I can't believe I sat through this garbage.

Midsommar," An unnecessary long and boring remake of The Wicker Man and The Wicker Tree
",abisio,04-Jul-19,"The original Wicker Man (1973, with Christopher Lee) was not a terrifying movie until the very end but the suspense kept everybody guessing. The movie become a cult sensation (at least some of the final cuts of the film) not as an horror movie but as a metaphoric view of religion and society; there was some legends that the movie was based on real facts about Pagan cults, north of UK. The Wicker Tree has the same original director and a very similar story but instead of a Christian Police we have an Evangelical couple on a difficult relationship.
Midsommar takes basically the couple in crisis and a couple other characters, moves them to Sweden instead of UK.After a family tragedy; a girl joins her former boyfriend and some other friends, a group of grad students working on a thesis, on a visit to a Sweden community to appreciate the summer solstice celebration.They meet there white dressed community; quite inclined to drugs and rituals (and strange music).Ari Asher already showed he prefer style over substance (and story) on Hereditary (a movie that copy a lot from Rosemary baby's and other horror classics) but at least that movie was shorter.It seems he loves to film but hates editing; basically in love with his own scenes. Here, the continuous display of white dressed people dancing, playing instrumental music and doing strange rituals (in eternal daylight) becomes tediously repetitive without adding anything to the promised intrigue. Characters reactions became so absurd that even the movie laughs about some events. Clocking over 140 minutes the movie will be too slow even cutting an hour off. It is incredible that with such unnecessary length the resolution is rushed and confusing.There are couple of violent deaths shown, and a few others not. Everything quite predictable and not very engaging; because the director keeps distance with the main characters avoiding any empathy. In fact it is never clear if anyone is worth saving; specially Puig characters who is borderline obsessive and perhaps psychotic.In brief; there is no horror, the movie is tedious and far from entertaining. Critics praised it because its pictoric values, but people run out of the cinema after a while or start snoring. Skip this one and go to see something worth like THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE","

It depicts the absolute horrors we as mankind are capable of and not only choose, but religiously plan to execute for ""the greater good"". The most terrifying part? This type of story is based on historical fact! Ritualistic human sacrifices can be seen in ancient cultures all over the world from Pagan to Mayan.The script is limited, but I believe this is by choice.

Midsommar," Extremely Disappointing!
",vengeance20,10-Jul-19,"From the writer & director who brought you the, ok but slow & boring Hereditary comes this 2.0 version bore of a film which makes that film seem Oscar worthy.I didn't exactly have high expectations of this film due to the writer & directors previous film, Hereditary being pretty boring & slow. It had the same poor directional, bad cinematography & overall poor editing seen in this film, but it was ok & had some creepy things going on in it. Hereditary at least was a horror film & executed that well throughout, plus it was shorter...So with that film comes another from the same writer & director, Midsommar. Long story short, the film is about a group of young 20 something's who head off to Sweden & part take in a wicker man like cult.While I knew this already from the trailers & previews, the film had little else to go on, but you'd expect a film that is 2 hours & 22 minutes to at least have something to go on if not a lot. But the film didn't sadly. The film for 3/4 is basically the group milling about this compound, sleeping, eating, drinking, drug taking, sitting, dancing & part taking in the weird activities this cult have for them. Only 1/4 of the film was horror. It's pretty sad to be honest. I felt the film was way too overloaded with the various activities you saw in the film if not extremely repetitive. The film could've been shorten down by at least 40 minutes tops, saving the rest for either a home release or keep them as deleted scenes. Slow burner or not, this just took the biscuit for pacing & was more frustrating, if not annoying to watch if anything else. Not entertaining.There would be a lot of scenes which dragged & dragged awkwardly for no reason, even the cut clips themselves in the said scenes. There would even be suspenseful scenes which would take forever in a day to get to the ""point"" or ""pay off"" it was ""supposedly going to until it would then cut to another scene. Annoying & yet this writer & director claims this is a horror?
The opening was bad too, not very bad, but not very good either. Don't get me wrong it was sinister, but it dragged & you felt it after the 3 minute mark. Even the part after the phone call sequence when Dani discovered her sister had killed herself & their parents via gassing from a gas exhaust from a running car dragged. You'd be sitting there thinking ""come on, just get to the point what's happening!?"" a lot of scenes did this in the film as I stated above. Not to mention the scenes that did do this cheated you & lead on into nothing. The opening was 12 minutes & 30 seconds long. You get over the opening at around 5 minutes, but to see title of the film & the opening credits roll after that long seems very tedious if not ridiculous.The film itself was just filled with a lot of ""what the hell!?"" moments, even funny ones to be honest. The scenes would either be random, out of place or just badly put together with little to no narrative whatsoever. Not even in the obvious in terms of narrative.Annoying parts included excessive wailing, crying, yelling & nauseousness. This again has a lot to do with the pacing & poor editing this film had. Even the parts which were suppose to be visually artistic got on your nerves as you just wanted them to get to the point & move on, the film travelled at a snails pace & felt way to over padded. Watching slugs race to even paint dry would be more fun than this. The film didn't even scare me at all, little to no horror. The film was more annoying & bizarre even for its own good to watch. I don't get the entertainment value. There was no plot to speak of & the film simply went nowhere. It fizzled out after the first 40 minutes.However the acting was good, the gore effects were ok but nothing which in my mind would warrant an 18+ certificate from the BBFC. I seen more gore & violence in this year Superhero Horror Film, Brightburn which was only 15+. Crazy.The director & writer himself claimed that Hereditary wasn't his first horror, but this film was? What? Ari Aster said that Midsommar was his first (then) going to be his first as Hereditary was just a ""family drama"" type film. The statement itself couldn't be more pungent in irony as Hereditary was more of a horror than this film would ever be.Overall the film was flat out terrible & one the worst horror films of 2019 & one of the worst films overfall for this year alone. Ari Aster shouldn't make anymore of these films unless he looks at what went wrong with this one. Critics, cinema snobs & Rotton Tomatoes especially will praise this mess for either biased views on what makes a good horror film alone, to what makes a good film in general. I disliked this film & found it to be disappointing in the extreme. 1/10","

Midsommar," SOOOOO Unbelievably BAD
",t-ktinney,05-Oct-20,"This is absolutely one of the worse movies I've ever had the unfortunate experience to watch. Watching a Hallmark Channel Christmas movie would be a better option. Not kidding folks. It's so freaking slow and way too damn long. All the lead female do s (the way overrated Florence Pugh) does is mope mope mope, cry, mope, stare into space, stare at her butthole BF (who's junk we see in all its glory), scream, stare some more, mope, and walk around looking lost. Oh, and she mopes around through the entire movie. She has, literally, 2, maybe 3, expressions throughout the movie. Other characters were pointless-like the jerk friend that's the ""clown"" and does a VERY BAD thing involving a dead tree at the weirdo festival. The movie was so pointless, made no sense (wtf is up with the ending!????), and just so so so bad. All these good, even 5-6 star reviews, are morons. Maybe they used the same hallucinogens watching the movie the characters in this did. SKIP CRAP.","

Midsommar," Terrible, predictable, overrated
",CheeseburgerRandy,20-Dec-20,"I am not a big horror fan. I also believe trailers are ruining movies because (a lot) of them reveal too much. I also never saw Hereditary. So, when I saw only one trailer for this movie, I was genuinely intrigued and enthusiastic for it. Heard/read the hype, nothing specific but overall hoopla.Wow, the movie is just not good, at all. Anyone who thinks this is deep, takes themselves too seriously. The movie is entirely predictable once they reach the ""not obvious cult"". Unless you've never done psychedelics before, there's absolutely no way you would continue to stay after seeing 2 deaths and there's certainly no way a GRADUATE THESIS would keep you there either. Dumber reason to ""stay/go back"" is Jeepers Creepers.It can be summed up like this: emotionally fragile female in a toxic relationship suffers a great tragedy. Gets to travel to Europe (by pity basically), takes psychedelics, joins a cult and lives (when everyone else dies, including her ""terrible"" boyfriend).""You just don't get it"" is probably the (second) most overused response for not liking something, ever. (Rick and Morty is first). And look at it this way, if the roles were gender reversed, this movie would get lambasted and not praised.The way the movie was shot....eh. Parts were good, others didn't make sense (to me) as in, purposely shot ""weird"". It was just too, overt(?) for me? I just didn't particularly care for most of it.","

Midsommar," Don't listen to the negative reviewers for this one.
",deloudelouvain,23-Jan-20,"First of all I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to the negative reviewers on here. Normally I tend to listen more to the negative than the positive reviewers as often there are alot of fake positive reviews from people involved in a movie. But in this case the high rating it got from more then 100000 voters made me watch it, and I can't say I regret it. The cinematography is great, the acting is pretty good, and the story is captivating. I'm normally not a big fan of long movies, and in this case I even watched the director's cut that is 30 minutes longer, and never did I get a boring feeling. For that the story is too suspenseful, there is an evil dark ambiance to it that wants you to watch more. Movies about cults are most of the time interesting to watch as those people have a complete different lifestyle to ours, and mostly because they're deranged and/or brainwashed. Watching crazy people act weird, isn't that entertainment? To me it is for sure. Ari Aster did a very good job with this movie, that slow building tension all a long is brilliant. Personally I would have put a more oppressing and dark soundtrack to it, to make it more evil but that's just my opinion. Midsommar is a good movie in this genre, better than I thought it would be.","

Midsommar," Ari Aster back at it again
",danielnunez-81518,03-Jul-19,"I believe that even after just his second feature Ari Aster's name will be synonymous with bizarre/polarizing/dreadful cinema; his name might even become an adjective/verb or a categorization for film altogether (Lynchian, for instance).This movie kind of left about the same impression Hereditary left me with after the first view. After my first viewing of Hereditary I felt that it was just good, after a few more viewings and analyses, I now consider it a genius take on trauma and grief. I have a feeling this is what I'm going to come to realize from Midsommar. It was definitely insane with surreal imagery, but I honestly wish there was more backstory to Dani and her family; if there was more of a fleshed out concept about Dani and her family I feel like the movie would've have a more circular conclusion. But now knowing the kind of filmmaker Aster is shaping up to be, I don't think closure is what he aims for at all, leaving just enough to the imagination to push your buttons even further.Florence Pugh humanizes the surreal scenes with her presence. She's a great anchor for the plot.Definitely going to be taking another look at this.","

I have no idea how anyone can like this or think it's a good movie. First half was really boring, I actually fell asleep twice watching it and the second half is gory, predictable and stupid. Just to make sure I didn't miss anything I actually read the director's explanation to this film (not that I needed to) and to be honest I don't see the point of all of it except to show us that some people have a really sick mind. Is this the point? To shock, disturb and disgust us? Well, mission accomplished. I'm completely disappointed with how stupid and sick people can be (and I'm talking about everyone involved in making this bs). The only thing good was creative camera work but that's it. The rest is pure crap! I wish I could rate it a zero. Even 1/10 is too much! Oh, and I don't get how is this a horror movie?! It's boring and sick.

",saccool,03-Oct-20,"The camera work, cinematography, scenery, costumes, & special effects were fantastic.
The movie was terrible. The plot was drawn out, the only likable character became barely likable at the end. The rest of group you couldn't wait to die off because they were so rude and obnoxious in the first place. The fact that they all willingly stayed after the first ""ceremony"" made them even more unlikable.
I appreciate art and the more subtle horror/thriller films but this one had no surprises, no mystery. Anyone that has seen even half a dozen horror movies could figure out this whole movie as they go and probably even more if they watched the trailer.

Unfortunately, I had the privilege to watch the 2:28 version and not its director's cut, which is around 24 minutes longer. If I'm lucky, I will remedy to that!What the director seemingly failed to realize was that either you make a full-blown horror or a psychological psychedelic experience. Anything in between and borrowing from either parties is most surely to fail and make some ... people laugh at it as if it was a black comedy.On a side note, it felt like a real experience and I truly hope that THAT don't exist out there for real.","

Midsommar," Misleading, so very misleading
",codygdietrich,24-Oct-20,"There is minimal violence, lack of one controlling leader knocks cult out and it is a monotheistic religion so considering Merrimack Webster defines pagan as polytheistic that's wrong as well. It's not scary, creepy, dark or even disturbing. I've seen documentaries on tv about real world cults that feel more like a horror movie than this movie did. The movie is called Midsommar which would be midsummer the date of midsummer varies from culture to culture but is in the end of June. They dance around the may pole and crown a may queen which are activities done during a May Day celebration which is May first, almost two months before the midsummer festival. So not only is the description inaccurate but the title and what happens in the plot are historically and culturally inaccurate. It is a 2 1/2 hour movie that never made me care about the characters, provoked any fear, terror, anxiety or paranoia, the only two points that might have been uncomfortable weren't because at that point it was expected and I didn't care enough for it to make me uncomfortable. It is a well shot and doesn't drag particular bad for most of it but feel more like a mediocre unusual drama than a horror film.","

",srgymrat33,20-Oct-19,"I love horror. I love disturbing. I love indie film.This was all of those things, and not really anything more. It was disturbing and gross without any point, it did not need to be over 2 hours, it did not need the mating ritual to take 15 min, it did not need to have dead bodies all over the place, it did not need to show the smashing of the head with a sledgehammer or the smattering of blood after the apparent suicide. The same effect would have been created by the suicide itself, alluding to the fact the the mating was happening, implying the bodies were around(the foot was a nice touch, up out of the garden). That would have added to the horror, the mystery and the feel.I understand the appeal, a light colored movie with a dark theme, a time when light is most apparent leading to the most dark, the fact Americans impose their own values everywhere they go, without seeking to really understand and they therefore miss out. Its a good start, a good idea, with absolutely no follow through.I left feeling angry, disgusted and disappointed in a movie I had looked forward to for some time.So many good movies out there, spend your time on something else.","

Midsommar," Should've read the reviews on this site first
",ario-34119,12-Jul-20,"I read the reviews from other sites and see the 7 ratings from IMDB and I fell for it. I should've read the reviews here before watching. When there are 1s and 2s and there are 9s and 10s, you better believe it every single time, the 1s and 2s are the right ones.This film is unwatchable. Every single character is unlikable. A group of stupid a-holes and a needy boyfriend-dependent girl (what is this, the 60s? Girls are not like that anymore) although Pugh is okay in her performance and the Seth Rogen wannabe (for the love of God, I don't know why anyone wants to be Seth Rogen) just drags his feet around like a zombie, I can't tell whether he can't act or simply having no material to work with, as I suspect the latter because this is utterly bad writing. The only sensible character is a girl on the phone whose face we never see.Around the 30-40 minutes mark, as they reach the village, which is full of beautiful faces (Sweden does not disappoint on this, I'm telling you) I put a bet on the plot and guess what, it's exactly that without any twists and turns. There is no horror, there is no thriller, just creepiness and trippy shots. Oh, don't get me wrong, there's plenty of gore. But gore doesn't automatically make a film a horror film. It's the build-up to the act that results in gore that's important. Is it horrifying or thrilling? In this film, the answer is no. On the first instance you can easily guess what's gonna happen, like, ten minutes prior to the actual act. On another instance, you just see a mutilated body without any hint whatsoever as to what happens to it. No, it's not horror, it's just disturbing and unnecessarily disgusting. There's a f---ing scene (I mean, literally, a scene of a couple doing a sexual intercourse) that is the most disgusting scene I've ever seen in a film.Some people compare this to The Wicker Man. I'm telling you, let's not talk about Lee's version, Cage's version is way better than this. People who rate this film 9s and 10s and not friends and family of the filmmakers, can I have what you're smoking?","

The aesthetics of the community are beautifully realised, and the film also suggests some interesting (though never fully developed) ideas about cult behaviour. What's lacking (and where it differs from its distinguished predecessor) is the complete absence of how and why, nor is there any sense that any of the community members holds anything less than 100% belief. It's might seem a strange comment on a horror movie, but I would have preferred a little more sociology and economics.","

Rather than forgive him and get a stranger horribly tortured to death, she chooses to kill the person who stuck around in a miserable relationship for her.I get this is supposed to be an allegory of the main female leads life but it isn't good enough to pull that off.Finally, imagine in the current climate of 2019, with the horrible double standards of racism and sexism flying around both politically and socially. Now imagine the genders are reversed and it was the jealous unstable boyfriend who had his girlfriend tied up in a bear carcass while she gets burned alive for the crime of getting drugged and having sex with some dude.

I should have taken that as a hint.This movie was horrible-just horrible. It was like watching paint dry. It was way too long, the acting is an abomination, and no matter how good the cinematography is, it can't possibly make up for the ludicrous mess of a film I just saw. DO NOT listen to the critic reviews, or headlines. This movie is not scary, and it's certainly not suspenseful-because there's no climax to lead up to. What's worse, the ending smacks of repeat from Aster's previous film. He's a one-trick pony, and this film seals the deal. I didn't care about any of the characters, despite unresolved and totally unexplored backstory. They are complete idiots for staying for the entire pagan festival. Every activity, every scene is based on drugs, and why would anyone do any drugs while isolated in a village that seems to glorify death?The entire premise of the movie is predicated on an event that, had it not happened, none of the ensuing events would ever have taken place. Is this a yearly festival, or is it every 90 years? There sure were an awful lot of pictures of May Queens...the plot holes are endless. Out-of-place movie references (apparently this electricity-free village has a TV and access to movies from the 90s!) Rituals and games that make no sense and are never explained. Characters standing around in silence for no reason with bizarre looks on their faces. Gross shots of old naked people. Stupid jokes that made no one in the theater laugh. In fact, the entire audience was laughing at all the parts that were supposed to be serious moments. This is usually an indication that the film director has FAILED MISERABLY.So many missed opportunities for a good horror film that were totally abandoned. And don't give me this garbage that the movie was supposed to be some sort of metaphor for a failed relationship. That just insults the intelligence of everyone who makes the unfortunate mistake of viewing this film. This movie was a waste of time, money, and my intellect.

",LeonLouisRicci,27-Aug-21,"Some have Related the Psychedelic Experience to a Religious Epiphany.In His Follow-Up to the Mega-Hit ""Hereditary"" (2018), Writer/Director Ari Aster has once Again gone to the ""Dark-Side"" of Family or Communal Allegory.The Look is Psychedelica with a Colorful Palette of Flowers Everywhere and Bright Costumes of Cult-Members Exhibiting some Very Dark Rituals and Bizarre Behavior.It's Florence Pugh that Centers the Film with a Personality Constantly on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown with Angst Oozing from every pour.Confused, Intimidated, and Largely Lost, even in a ""Normal"" Setting, Suffering from a Family Tragedy of the Suicide/Murder of Her Sister, Father, and Mother.So, the Poor ""Dani"" goes from Barely Coping to a Strange, to Say the Least, Environment of Completely Foreign Religious Rituals.With a Boy-Friend that is as Vacant and Vacuous as a Tree-Stump.What Goes On in ""Midsommar"" is the Stuff that Films Like ""The Wicker Man"" (1973) and others have Explored.But this Film-Maker makes Every Religious Minute of it Stretched to the Breaking Point that Onlookers like ""Dani"" and the Audience will have Trouble Keeping a Grip.The Movie is Disturbing, Unsettling, Disgusting, Beautiful, and gives us quite a Ride to the ""Other Side"" of the World both Figuratively and Culturally and it is one that Few will Find Routine.The Sunshine is Eternal On Screen and the Darkness Resides in the Mind and Spirit.A Gut-Wrenching, Glorious Take on the Horror Film and the Horrors of Indoctrinated Souls Bound by Tradition and Ethnocentric, Hubristic Capitulation.","

Midsommar," Sadly Disappointing
",grantpaulsen,03-Jul-19,"Maybe I need some more time to think about it, but as of right now I am very disappointed in this film. I didn't hate it, I loved the cinematography, shot composition, and Florence Pugh's performance was pretty fantastic. Some of the other actors were good and some others were not so good. I love Ari Aster and his direction, and I loved his previous film Hereditary, which makes this one even more disappointing. I thought it was pretty repetitive and boring, there were a lot of scenes I felt could've been cut, and it probably would've been better. Also, I thought the film was quite pretentious and self indulgent. This was one of my most anticipated films of the year and I wish I could've liked it more.","

Midsommar," Unforgettable
",deandraslater,04-Feb-20,"I'm not one of those people who thinks every horror film should be 80-90 minutes. There are too many brilliant horror films that have pushed (or exceeded) that 2 hour mark so I can't say that's a wise barometer of a film's quality. However, Midsommar could stand a few trims here and there to tighten things up.The issue with Midsommar is this - we've all seen movies like this before. We know what's going to happen, yet the characters don't, so we spend an awfully long time waiting for the inevitable as we have to see ancient cult rituals carried out in real time. It can make for an exhausting watch.It's not the story that Midsommar is telling that's interesting, but the way that it's telling it. With its focus on a toxic relationship between Dani and Christian, it colors a familiar story with something altogether different and unique.When Midsommar really hits its stride, though, it's off and running and better than just about any other horror film in recent memory. Ari Aster has rounded up another phenomenal cast just like with Hereditary and the film is drenched in dread from the first frame all the way to the unforgettable final frame.It's, without a doubt, worth seeing.","

Midsommar," Disturbingly Pointless
",Slarkshark,10-Feb-21,"Well this was not fun, not one bit. 'The Wicker Man' (2006) is one of my most despised movies and 'Midsommar' was a lot like it. I wont argue that it's actually filmed really well. The cinematography and camera work is excellent. The reason I am not a fan is it's whole goal is to be unsettling and disturbing as possible. There is nothing to be gained from it, nothing to cheer or root for. Nothing is really explained as you watch in confusion and grimace.'Hereditary' is of course similarly made, except I actually thought it was worth making because there was a point. It too was unsettling but it had a story, it wasn't just trying to be weird.I can't say I wasn't warned before watching this because I was, but I thought I would give it a shot and I wish I hadn't. This may be some people's thing (not sure why) but it definitely wasn't for me.","

Midsommar," Millenial moron misadventure.
",st-shot,14-Feb-20,"This stunningly immature work of horror under blue skies about a well scrubbed overly benign cult into ritual gore bordering on the operatic opens with an intriguing table setter, a labor intensive slaughter of parents, before it goes full tilt silly at a remote Swedish village where members frolic in white with woodwinds and wander lust.Christian wants out with Dani ( Florence Pugh ) but sticks by her after the traumatic loss of her parents. She can be a real drag and further dampens matters when she goes along with the guys to do some tripping with a cult comprised of all ages and smiles. On the surface it looks like a Utopian society but then the ambiguous by-laws begin to kick in and things get gruesome.It becomes apparent upon arrival at the village that Midsommar is a group Wicker Man in the making, it's supposed well educated protagonists clueless as 12 year olds. Moving at a snails pace writer director Ari Aster's festival ground setting has a very artificial wide open emptiness that he accents with strategic groupings of posing cliches. Pugh's simpering Dani leads a cast of supposed adults acting like kids and all slow on the draw through this debacle as she mopes from end to end gets buried under flowers along with being crowned with an Easter basket while witnessing more horrors but with a new outlook. Aster's heavy handed, poorly edited money scenes are sluggish and unintentionally comic at times but one will find little to chuckle about after being duped into tolerating this obscenely lengthy gore bore.","

Midsommar," Some of the VERY BEST Diving Ever seen in a Movie, With GREAT LANDINGS!!!!
",PartialMovieViewer,08-Sep-20,"Wow!!! 10 of 10 of 10, The acting is shallow and overdone, but the splash landings - OMG - very splashy and really artsy. Those who take the jump without a struggle deserve at least some honorable mention. How can one not give a standing ovation for these spineless lemmings? For Me? I give these silly action-scenes two big clappity-claps and a free sponge bath. And What else? Now this is just me and my crystal ball, but with such amazing lack of plot and shabby structure - you know what that tells me? Nope, this is not another 'Birdman'...or is I? I think so. In fact it's obvious - one big academy award for script - BRILLIANT! I sense many of these young actors will be slingshotted, off that pointless cliff-of-doom, into their next big part - let's see - another flick about unstoppable man-eatng sharks. Hands down, the world needs more movies about hungry sharks. Now back to critiquing this fine product of natural creation which managed to spill over the porcelain edge of its intended target - and - Amazingly ended up on a viewing screen. Such a feat in itself is mind shattering. Another shocking thing to me is how many people think they liked this. OF course those would be the so-called movie connoisseurs have that superhuman depth-vision that sees more than us mere humans. News flash - hahahahahaha, you didn't like it, it was really bad, really, really bad and you wasted your hard earned money on this thing! Obviously there was a story needing to be told on the screen. Sadly the childish attempt failed and was obviously written with dull crayons. Puerile attempts at lecturing voided cranials through film has been in practiced for decades. Successful? Mildly...maybe - I mean - there are those connoisseurs languishing in their mind-palaces who are narcissistic about their useless views. I actually applaud them. Opinions are important, no matter how trivial. Speaking of opinions, let me try and decipher what the obvious understory is. People aimlessly fallowing a goofy dogma and jump off a cliff. Hmmm, maybe political? Maybe I don't car? That's it. You may like this. If you do, wonderful. I did not.","

Midsommar," A Perfect Example Of How And Why People Get Indoctrinated Into Cults
",jazzydonald-90958,09-Jul-21,"What's scary about Midsummer is how many people saw it as a happy movie. They were happy that Dani finally got what she wanted, a family. In reality, the Hårga are a cult. Pelle chose Dani to be the new member because he knew that she had no family or friends who would investigate her disappearance and was desperate for a sense of belonging.It's funny how people are confident that they'd never get indoctrinated into a cult, yet these same people didn't see the Hårga as a cult. I'm like, ""of course you wouldn't get indoctrinated into a cult. You're not desperate enough."" People join cults when, like Dani, their lives are in shambles. They're poor/homeless, their family abandoned them, their family is dead, they don't have friends, they're sick, or they're having an existential crisis and are seeking guidance.Some people claim that the Hårga wasn't that bad because they showed Dani she'd be getting into. But, does she though? For example, of the Hårga's traditions is when their members reach the age of 72, they're no longer seen as being of use to the village and commit suicide by falling off a mountain. So, what happens when a member reaches 72, is perfectly healthy, and doesn't want to die? Do you think the cult is just gonna let them live and die of natural causes? No. They're either gonna force them off the mountain, sacrifices them, or exile them to the forest to fend for themselves. Since the Hårga live miles away from civilization and don't have phones or cell reception, no one can call for help.The Hårga, like all rural villages, believe in traditional gender roles. What happens when a female member is infertile or doesn't want to get pregnant? Or a male member doesn't want to work or becomes disabled? Cults are notorious for being ruthless to members who step out of line or can't contribute. We never see Hårga members getting punished or tortured for insubordination in the movie because they wanted to show Dani all their good sides. Do you think Pelle would've taken Dani to the village if it was raining or there wasn't a festival? No. He specially chose the perfect day to make the Hårga as appealing as possible. Dani is still trapped and will be forced to conform to their way of life, or else.People also say the Hårga is like paradise compared to mainstream American society because they could give Dani what she needed without technology. However, it wasn't modern society that caused Dani to be miserable, it was a combination of Christian's apathy and Dani's sister murdering her parents. We never know why she murdered her parents and killed herself. Was she mentally ill? We're Dani's parents abusing her? We don't know. Society also didn't make Dani introverted; that's just the way she is. If Christian were a better boyfriend, and Dani had better friends, Pelle wouldn't have targeted her for indoctrination.There's also been debate on whether or not the Hårga are a cult. They are, but not in the way we think of cults. They're similar to the Amish. They can claim to not be a cult since the members are allowed to leave. There's even a tradition called Rumspringa where Amish teens can choose to either stay or leave the village.The problem is both the Hårga and Amish's way of life is completely incompatible with the outside world. If any of them did leave, where could they go? They don't have driver's licenses, passports, dental records, social security codes, birth certificates, education records, or any form of official identification. As for work, the only thing they could do is low-skill factory work, be a maid/housekeeper, or a farmhand.People who were born and raised there are unlikely to leave because that would mean abandoning all their friends, family, and the only life they've ever known. Even though they're not technically hostages, their culture makes assimilation with the outside world is almost impossible. That's why a lot of them say, ""Why would I leave? I have everything I need."" This is why we see none of the Hårga leave, even though they could. That's why self-sustaining cults are dangerous.","

Midsommar," A Mesmerizing and Gorgeous 140 min Slow Burn Behemoth
",Yee_Reviews,04-Jul-19,"Good: Hands down the production and cinematography are amazing and truly comes to life over the course of the film to emphasize the film's purpose/themes. The cast overall is great, each one playing their role respectively whether it is an outsider or a cult member, especially Florence Pugh who goes through a lot over the course of the film.Bad: The film moves relatively at a great pace until near the 3rd act and then takes its time to craft its ending and at times dragged and started to get stale. There are so many clues/culture traditions learned through brief images of paintings and drawings in the community. Although this serves great for analysis and more viewings as a first watch it is a lot to comprehend and can be confusing near the end if you do not remember some of the drawings. It goes without saying that the characters do not make the smartest of decisions and there are quite a few horror cliches.Overall: The film triumphs in creating a beautiful yet disturbing atmosphere in broad daylight. There are powerful performances filled with emotions. However, the run-time goes a little past its run time and an ending that was not the most satisfying. Although I'll be back for more viewings to see the easter eggs and hidden clues, I personally prefer ""Hereditary"" over this one.3.5/5*Pro-Tip look at the painting/drawings from right to left
*I strongly do not recommend this to children, 18+ mainly because of the slow-burn and material.","

Midsommar," What in the actual heck
",phojar,03-Feb-21,"What?? I mean what??The film work was good, but this movie was absolutely terrible. So drawn out. Strange plot, not exciting at all.To start - this movie is way too slow getting started. A girl with a boyfriend that isn't that into her, loses her family when her bipolar sister murders their parents and kill's herself. The boyfriend is planning a trip with his friends and did not tell her about it, which he then invites her along hoping she wouldn't go, but surprise she does go. All of that takes about 40 minutes in the movie.Next, they arrive at the retreat and strange things are happening all around. They watch two tribe elders jump off a cliff - after a guy explained the ""life cycle"" which only goes to 72 and the girl asked what happens after 72, and the guy made a motion like they died. So why was this a surprise?Next, the Americans start disappearing (getting killed), but we don't get to see any of that, it is only inferred.Then in a scene similar to eyes wide shut, the jerk boyfriend plants his seed in one of the tribe girls while her mom helps him push it in her.The girl sees her boyfriend having sex with the girl, and starts crying. She did a lot of crying in the movie, it was quite annoying. Somebody tell this chick her boyfriend doesn't like her!In the final scene, the girl who became Queen of the tribe through a dance off, gets to choose who is scarified and she chooses her boyfriend.","

",neil-476,10-Jul-19,"After a distressing family tragedy, Dani joins her rather indifferent boyfriend and his 3 college friends to attend summer solstice celebrations at the remote Swedish commune where one of them was brought up.When I saw the trailer, I thought ""This reminds me of The Wicker Man."" And I was right. If you are familiar with the original Wicker Man, this movie will not surprise you in the slightest. But is it any good?Well, it is beautifully photographed and there is some excellent sound design. There is a sense of creeping uneasiness, and some general nastiness here and there - it is a horror film, after all. The direction is sometimes very good, and sometimes a bit too much like showing off. And Florence Pugh is jaw-droppingly good.There is nothng by way of made-you-jump moments - not a bad thing, in my view.But there are a number of plot points which are inadequately dealt with which, to me, means they shouldn't have been there to start with - crass college pal Mark, for instance, whose attitude towards Dani has no payoff whatsoever. And this is particularly relevant given that this rather slight tale runs for 140 minutes. This tale unfolds at a pace which is a bit too leisurely. Losing half an hour would have improved the pace, losing an hour would have moved it along whip-fast.An excellent, and VERY disturbing final shot, though.","

Midsommar," What happened to 80 minute horror movies?
",MOscarbradley,12-Jul-19,"What is it with horror films these days or should I say, what is with Ari Aster horror films that they must clock in at around two and a half hours. I still remember the time when you could get a perfectly decent fright-fest at about eighty minutes or less but then perhaps Aster has loftier things in mind than just scaring the pants off us. His first feature, ""Hereditary"", had a host of real frighteners coupled with a much deeper tale of grief and how we cope with it and it worked very nicely in both camps thanks largely to a terrific performance from Toni Collette as a grief-stricken mother whose demons are very personal indeed.His new film. ""Midsommar"" runs for two hours and twenty-seven minutes and in its tale of cults and potential sacrifices it looks like it might go down the same road as its predecessor in both frightening us and making us think, particularly after a beautifully built-up opening involving murder and suicide. However, once Aster whisks us, and his four protagonists, off to Sweden at the invitation of a Swedish friend, we find ourselves in the middle of ""The Wicker Man"" and some very dodgy 'midsommar' festivities. Actually the slow build-up here also works very nicely. Aster takes his time, (well, he does have almost two and a half hours to play around with), and it's clear to anyone who has seen ""The Wicker Man"" or any other horror film, come to think of it, that when something seems too good to be true, it usually is and that all this chanting and mumbo-jumbo can only end badly, which, of course, it does a long time after the movies started.If I sound flippant it's because I really had high hopes for ""Midsommar"" after the vastly superior ""Hereditary"". Nothing happens in this picture you can't predict a mile off, (even the killer closing shot is fairly obvious when you think of it). Of course, things might have been different had Aster a leading man who could have convinced us he was disorientated, frightened or even interested in what was going on. Instead, we get Jack Reynor, whose performance is surely a shoo-in for next year's Razzie. Reynor started his career with a reasonably interesting performance in ""What Richard Did"" as an Irish schoolboy who accidentally kills a classmate but it's been all down hill from there, culminating in this misplaced, wooden performance.As his girlfriend, Florence Pugh, (she of ""Lady Macbeth"" fame), does what she can with a one-dimensional role. Indeed, this is not an actor's picture with no-one, including the usually reliable Will Poulter, making much of an impression. It has its moments to be sure, with Aster even managing to inject some grisly humour into the proceedings and perhaps there is a good eighty minute horror movie struggling to get out but by adding an extra hour he kills it. Perhaps the moral of the film is just avoid Sweden in the summer because if the cults don't get you, the tics will.","

Midsommar," Director's Cut To Be 30 Minutes Longer - PLEASE, NO!
",tuckerfurguy,13-Jul-19,"One would most certainly enjoy this movie after having sampled the same drugs that the characters in the movie ate and drank - otherwise it was a wasted 2 hrs and 27 minutes.I would never have put this movie in the horror genre - nothing scary or frightening about it - unless the whole experience, as a viewer - was abysmal; which is certainly was - then, yes, it was a horror.Full of nonsensical visuals, dialogue, sets, and no discernible plot; ""B-grade movie"" acting; ""nails on the chalkboard"" soundtrack/singing/musical interludes. Cheaply made sets, costumes, ""special effects,"" and annoying film location(s). Furthermore, I'm guessing - poorly paid cast and crew. The disposal of characters in this movie, again, ludicrous preposterous and lame. Howevere, the ""mating"" scenes did bring the theater patrons to rousing rounds of louder and louder laughter; which was repeated, to a lesser degree, through a couple of other scenes.Upon waiting the nearly 2 1/2 hours for the film to conclude with an ending that would lend some credible understanding to the plot, the credits began to roll and the theater patrons began to roll out of their seats, with murmured comments of how terrible and ridiculous the movie was; what a piece of offal that was... waste of time and money.And the writer-director is preparing to add 30 minutes more to this work of art?","

Midsommar," a sunny nightmare
",ferguson-6,03-Jul-19,"Greetings again from the darkness. Summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. We are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker Ari Aster cares little for tradition. Well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. His feature film debut was last year's mega-hit HEREDITARY, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association Top 10 list for 2018.HEREDITARY was filled with darkness and dread, and Mr. Aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as Dani (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. During her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor, SING STREET) is a bit strained. The brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking Dani's family. Christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends.An awkward group conversation leads Dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to Sweden. The purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for Josh (William Jackson Harper, ""The Good Place"") to work on his thesis. The other guys in the group are Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) whose family in Sweden is hosting the festival, and Mark (Will Poulter, THE REVENANT) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions.And with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. Try to picture a Folk Horror Comedy Fairy Tale Break-up Pagan Cult film, which at any given time reminds of MOTHER!, THE WICKER MAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE VILLAGE, SUSPIRIA, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. It is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. And that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. Most of it is filmed outside during Sweden's Midnight Sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for Woodstock). The daylight messes with your senses and expectations. Bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. Although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen.So without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to Sweden mushroom trip, a Waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a Powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. We also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the Queen of May. Of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late!Ms. Pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, Haley Lu Richardson) is terrific here. Her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. The excellent music from Bobby Krlic, better known as The Haxan Cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. I was so shell-shocked at the end, that I'm unable to confirm that the version of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"" is that of The Walker Brothers (Scott Walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. Director Aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. The cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever.","

Midsommar," Yes!
",FrenchEddieFelson,05-Aug-19,"With this second film, the director Ari Aster becomes a specialist of films that strongly disturb the audience via subtly-glaucous atmospheres.While Dani (Florence Pugh) comes out of a particularly tragic event, her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) will propose to her, while they were in a phase of rupture, to accompany him to a nine-day festival that takes place once every 90 years, around the summer solstice, in an isolated Swedish village. The trip was suggested by his friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) a native from the said village. The two other friends, Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter), are also part of the trip. But what begins as a carefree holiday will quickly take a far more ominous and disturbing turn, the villagers being all members of the same sect with radical and even barbaric traditions.Even if the script is radically different, Midsommar (2019) looks a bit like The Shining (1980) with its slow but ineluctable descent into hell. 7/8 of 10.","

Midsommar," Excellent horror film about a cult
",Cinemagoer77,25-Nov-19,"This is generally a disturbing film. Some people say it was funny perhaps because they were uncomfortable with some scenes yet so many people were offended or hated it. So my guess is the movie made people uncomfortable. Again, it was a disturbing film which many horror films are not these days. I welcomed Ari's latest effort as horror is becoming non-horrific lately with so many tropes that the genre is lacking these days. The 1 star reviewers ignore the story telling, ignore any of the characters, ignore the symbolism that exists through the entire story, and ignore the creepiness of some of the sociopathic members. You should rewatch it just to see how evil their foreign friend actually is. It is atleast a 4 or 5 star minimum. I say this is a thinkers horror film because i had to rewatch twice. Although the movie is gory it doesn't glorify the actions of the cult members. You get the feeling the cults are indeed the abnormalities we know they are and it's a visceral feeling to see them carry out their rituals. Cults can be argued as the anti-thesis of progress/freedom and how they possess the means to attract people is just as baffling. Well Midsommar offered a glimpse into the cult via codependency and loss. Add in charming sociopathy who tell people what they like to hear and we have some poor people who get lead into horror and loss of freedom/love. As a cult film this is atleast 8. Also, The wicker man comparisons need to stop. How many posession movies are there and how many times need they be compared? Cult horror is a sub-genre like zombie films are also a sub-genre. This is an excellent film about the horrors of a cult for modern times. I really think Ari is becoming a true master of horror. He leaves many viewers disturbed but also with warnings and lessons about what evil really is. He does not glorify horror..rather he reveals

Midsommar," One of the best films of the year.
",its-me6611,27-Nov-19,"10/10What a delightful experience. I am so happy I got to see this incredible piece of art. This surely is one of the best films I have ever seen.Plot: After the tragic death of her family, Dani an emotionally unstable girl is invited to see a mid-summer festival in Sweden by her boyfriend. What started as a drug fueled, fun adventure in an otherworldly place takes increasingly darker turns with the passing of each day.From the first scene of the film two things stood out. One is the cinematography and the other is the background music. And these two gets better and better until the end. I have never seen such a beautiful film. There are parts of films that looked incredible but to make film this beautiful is truly a work of art. The music and visual creates an ambiance that clearly gives a hint that this is going to be a tragic film. Once the friends make it into the idyllic village of the Harga the cinematography becomes even more awesome. It felt like a trip. The music always kept the tension even while nothing of unease was unfolding.The first time we get to see the bizarre and possibly dangerous nature of the pagan ritual the characters are part of comes almost after an hour. The scene is so shocking that I had to look away from the screen. This is not a film for the faint of heart. It gets grotesque and bizarre from this point on.The acting was superb. Florence Pugh did an excellent job portraying the emotional journey of Dani. The other members of the cast was fantastic.There are so many good things to say about this film. I did not see the trailer nor read anything about it. Wanted to see it with an open mind. I am glad I did that. I found this film way better than Hereditary which is an excellent film as well.","

Surely as the film progresses weirder and weirder happens. However there's little in the way of explaining why these things happen or these beliefs are held. You're just expected to be accept it. Stark contrast to how the film plays out at first.
Eventually the weird becomes gruesome and this just feels purely for cheap shock value with no real explanation as to why. I heard a lot of buzz about this film and was excited to see for myself. Personally I don't understand the hype and found this film to think itself far smarter than what it actually is by the time the credits rolled.","

Every single shot has the perfect orientation, costumes, temperature, emotion, disturbance (or lack of) prettiness and such. Everything is composed so we can be extremely disturbed by the events. The thing that stucked with me the most is the lack of strangeness and sympathy of the characters in this very unusual and creepy cult. The worst part for me was the deliberate but subtle brainwash manipulation. The fact that the worst scenes were presented as ""beautiful"" or ""chatartic"" was waaay too much for me. Every killing or fkd up scene is associated with flowers, and I find that connection way too disturbing to actually enjoy this.

",dcoke25,08-Nov-20,"I loved Heredity, and was excited to see his follow up. WHAT HAPPENED? From the opening scene, you know EXACTLY what's going to happen. So the rest of the movie is you seeing how they come to the OBVIOUS conclusion that was bashed into you from the first act.The thing that annoyed me the most was how unrealistically dumb a bunch of College students were in this film. By incident 3 they should have caught on, by incident 5 they're still clueless to what's going on.Horror is like comedy and is supposed to be structured the same; setup, punchline. All contingent on TIMING. Mess up the timing, ruin the joke/scare. There is a scene where you see what's going to happen and takes forever to come to the obvious conclusion. And you could argue it was building suspense, but when you think the audience will catch on to the outcome, that's when you pay it off as writer and director. BUT since Ari thinks we're idiots, he ruins the punchline. The scene I'm referring to was set up for 5 minutes with heavy handed clues given and our American Tourists not catching on, so the natives tell them to just Watch, and the protagonist is still asking obvious questions.Leading me to believe that Hereditary was panned by movie goers and this is Ari's passive aggressive response to that criticism. Basically calling us the viewers dense and using the college kids as viewer proxies. I can't tell you how much I HATED this movie. It's beautifully and meticulously shot, btu the story, pacing, and passive aggressiveness on Ari's part destroys this movie.","

Midsommar," A Strong Concept Let Down By Poor Execution
",reubenstojan,11-Aug-19,"What a letdown!!! Not that I had strong expectations for Midsommar, the latest Ari Aster film (Hereditary I still haven't finished but doubt I will), but it generally hooked me in for a time with its strong start and concept of a couple dealing with loss and suffering in a genuinely touching and poignant way.Florence Pugh totally sells it as the protagonist of a distressed woman on the brink of collapse after a personal tragedy and is by far, the strongest element of the film. Which is a pity when attached to an overly long, pompous and incredibly disappointing rip-off of the English horror film The Wicker Man. Yes, there are films that will inspire directors and new films for decades to come. Yes, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, Midsommar just can't seem to escape the familiar confines of it so desperately wanting to be the Wicker Man with its creepy tone, corruptible pagan society and unsettling ending.Yes, it seems the best form of medicine for dealing with grief and seeing how far a relationship will go after a sudden tragedy is a good old pagan festival. At first an intriguing premise when dealing with the troubled relationship between the main protagonist and her boyfriend (who is certainly not of the same acting chops) then turns into a silly farce where a strange Swedish cult slowly turns sinister and to incredibly ludicrous extremes. The Wicker Man cult may have done terribly wicked things, but at least it felt natural to them why they would harness such evil power. The cult in this film however just seem to go crazy one day just to benefit the plot and not have a very deep or meaningful reason behind their brutality. There is a pagan ritual involving pubic hair for example which never feels justified and is simply done for shock value. By then, the film loses all credibility and its purely the good performance from Florence that keeps it limping forward.On a technical standpoint, Midsommar fairs decently with a pleasantly creepy feel to the whole proceedings (there's an inspired 360 degree shot as the team head into the festival and one still shot of a few characters outside the sleeping quarters was strangely offputting in the right sense). The soundtrack was nothing to write home about but it worked for the tone.I suppose my main gripe with this film is literally the letdown the film becomes after such a promising start. What could have been a powerful look into loss and tragedy just falls apart into a unintentionally funny, silly. over-the-top mess as its tries to shock you with its scenarios. Looking forward to seeing more from Florence Pugh. Not so much Ari Aster.","

I understand why it's very off-putting to some, but many people will find another great film from Ari Aster.I understood the film even better once I heard it's an analogy of a breakup. It just also happens to be a very, very creepy and disturbing film with a hell of an ending, if you ask me. It's not that the ending has never been done before; it's that Aster executes it in a way that gets under your skin. Very brilliantly done.I found myself thinking about it a lot afterward. Even had a bit of trouble sleeping that night. It puts you into another world, a world of pure evil. Very much in the same ""world"" as Hereditary, where there is an absence of anything pure and holy, an absence of joy, and absence of goodness. Hey, it's a horror film. Isn't that what we want?If hell exists, this is very much what I would imagine it would be like.

Midsommar," An unclear film about a Swedish cult with strange traditions.
",movieman6-413-929510,03-Aug-19,"Midsommar is a new horror film directed and written by Ari Aster, the director of Hereditary.In the film, Dani (Florence Pugh) decides after a family tragedy with her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) and his friends to go on holiday to Sweden to deal with her tragedy and try to forget.
They travel to a remote Swedish village where the villagers celebrate a midsummer festival during the days where the sun keeps shining. The villagers invite their American guests to join in with their traditions.
For example, the group of friends starts celebrating the traditions where they first eat, dance and get high, but with the days the traditions of the village become darker and more bloody.This film is unclear because, just like the characters in the film, you do not know what exactly the villagers are doing during their festival. With the many things that happen in the film, you as a viewer miss a form of explanation. The explanation you get in the film is conveyed in a way that is too unclear, so that you still do not understand everything clearly after the film ends. That is how some moments come across as comical
Another problem with the film is that it takes too long for the dark actions to start, because the first strange moment in the film only starts after about an hour. This is how the film actually starts with a lack of clarity and also at a slow pace.This film also looks a lot like the film The Wicker Man from 1973 and because of the use of a bear in the film itself also something like the Nicolas Cage remake of The Wicker Man. In these films, an outsider also comes into contact with a cult and their strange habits. With this film you only got a clearer explanation as to what exactly happened in the films.
Despite the film's unclear story, Ari Aster has portrayed the film in a beautiful way. Every scene is almost clear, because the sun never sets in the film. He also makes nice use of what the movie looks like when the characters are high or when they are drugged. The film sets are also beautifully decorated with drawings and paintings of the traditions of the Swedish sect and these images also give away a bit of what is going to happen in the film.
Unfortunately, lesser effects have also been used, because with the dead bodies in the film you can see that they are cheap fake dolls as they used in old slasher horror films in the 1980s.Because the characters themselves do not know what exactly is happening, the actors also appear somewhat unclear in the film. Florence Pugh does good acting in the beginning after the family tragedy that her character is experiencing. Once in Sweden she comes along with the rest of the cast that the American teenagers play more confused about. Will Poulter knows how to create some comical moments in the film, but his character sometimes disappears and then comes back a while later with new comic comments.","

Midsommar," Aster at last provides 2019 with a decent film
",tonypeacock-1,06-Jul-19,"A 2019 new release film from director Ari Aster that evoked memories of a 1970s film banned for 20 years or so.Only Aster's second feature, following 2018's Hereditary, a film that for many (not myself) brought comparisons to The Exorcist.Midsommar instantly evokes comparisons to the classic Christopher Lee film, The Wicker Man with pagan cults and a palette of colour throughout.The colour is provided by a midsummer festival in Sweden, not the usual dark photography of a 'horror' film.The film also avoids the usual horror film cliches of jump scares and mood lighting.A rather long run time for a film of the genre at over 140 minutes. The extended run time allows for some plot development surrounding the characters which I will come on to.Without bringing major spoilers to the review the film involves a group of American students, two of whom Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) are a couple experiencing relationship issues involving a family tragedy.Christian has a circle of Inbetweeners like freinds some of whom provide comic relief throughout the film. I'm thinking of Mark (Will Poulter).A 'lads' break to the festival is planned but Dani, inadvertently is tagged along.What follows is a 'trip' the group could not imagine. A drug induced, time confusing period of some quite disturbing scenes.The film does have some gory sequences yet members of the cinema audience did snigger.Featuring some quite scary lookalikes including Bjorn from Swedish pop group Abba and Jeremy Corbyn!2019 has been a poor year thus far cinematically, probably as of July 2019 one, if not the best film.The Wicker Man had a legend in the late Christopher Lee. Midsommar doesn't. The casting is pretty low key but effective.Not a conventional horror more a psychological drama with a smuttering of black comedy.","

Midsommar," Tedious remake of The Wicker Man
",alistairc_2000,24-Aug-19,"I had heard good things about this but at no point did they say that the movie was an uncredited remake of far superior Wicker Man. Like Darklands this is pointless retread of familiar themes of paganism and renewing the land by the sacrifice of blood.The Plot.A really miserable frumpy woman repays the kindness shown by her boyfriend with hate. She is simple and misguided throughout. The best bit of the movie is the guys hanging out at the start. They all chat and say, hey why are you hanging out this that woman, she is miserable and just no fun to be with. Also she does not like sex. So this frumpy woman emotionally bludgeoned her man into taking her on a trip to Sweden. At no point do you understand why he would date her, she is really horrible to him throughout the movie.They get to Sweden and the place is so boring you would leave immediately. They decide to say on and it is all downhill from there. Also as soon as you see the Pyramid house, you know it is the wicker man.Thoughts
This like his last movie was a slow predictable movie for people who have not watched the originals. I watched it and thought it would never end. This is the wicker man. Okay they replaced the aforementioned man made from Wicker with a house but the effect was the same. The stupid games that they played on Woodward they play on all the characters. Also there is a switch to the May queen as the final denouement. Apart from that it is basically the same movie. Also there is a couple of bits where they steal scenes from Hershall Gordon Lewis's 2000 Maniacs.Watch it, if you want to watch a chick flick version of The Wicker Man. If is for the fans (if there are any) of the Neil La Bute Wicker man or the sequel to the original movie The Wicker Tree. Or the Welsh version Darklands.If you liked the original movie do not bother with this pointless remake.","

Midsommar," Not for everyone, but definitely unique
",cliftonofun,19-Jan-20,"So I am not big on ""horror"" movies, but this film felt different to me. There are several reasons for that. First, the film took its time - by the time these characters got to Sweden, you knew who they were, who they were becoming, and what fears they needed to face. There is a ton of stillness here, and it works. Second, while there were some fairly gruesome moments, the story focused less on making you jump and more on building an increasingly bizarre and creepy world. Third, Florence Pugh absolutely blew me away. Would I watch it again? Hard pass. But this film wanted to be more than just another scary movie, and it mostly succeeded. It may not work for everyone, but it sure was ambitious.","

Midsommar," Suddenly, Last Midsommar...
",Coventry,23-Apr-21,"In case you are Swedish, or of Swedish descent, and you righteously worry that from now on everyone will avoid your company during summer, or just stares at you as if you were a disturbed pagan sect member, you can blame writer/director Ari Aster. Just saying...This film required for me to slightly step out of my comfort zone. I have a natural aversion for horror/cult movies with a running time longer than 1h45 minutes; - let alone a running time of two and a half hours! Still, I really wanted to see ""Midsommar"", based on the recommendations of friends and fellow movie fanatics, and because it's inspired by (and paying tribute to) one of the greatest stories of all times; ""The Wicker Man"".Undeniably, I expected more. More of everything. It's probably wrong of me to compare everything here with the unsurpassable genius of ""The Wicker Man"", but this film is far weaker in every possible compartment. My first and major complaint obviously comes back to the endless running time. ""Midsommer"" has awfully little subject matter to fill up such a long film. The director, together with all the fans, will naturally claim the long periods of showing scenic footage, folklore dance/chant rituals and the effects of hallucinating herbs are essential for the atmosphere of the film, but it's incredibly tedious to sit through. Especially because, let's be honest, everybody already knows what is coming. I honestly think you needn't have seen ""The Wicker Man"" in order to predict what'll happen.And yet, there are many praiseworthy and qualitative aspects about ""Midsommar"" as well. I'm personally fascinated by the Scandinavian cultures and nature, so I was immediately enthusiast about a film taking place during Midsummer Festivities, and thus - in sheer contrast to practically every other horror movie ever made - in broad daylight! You simply must also admire that Ari Aster didn't turn his film into an open-air version of ""Hostel"", meaning the teenage protagonists aren't blatantly ignorant, or heading towards Europe without knowing anything about the local culture. Aster also put quite a lot of effort into providing the lead characters with a background and a personality.Strictly horror-wise, the film is a mixed bag as well. ""Midsommar"" contains a few very graphical and shocking moments, but the killings that actually matter occur off-screen. Presumably for atmospheric reasons again, but it nonetheless makes my horror heart bleed. And, finally, a major disappointment compared to ""The Wicker Man"", I found the soundtrack. For a film that constantly features dancing and chanting, the music is unmemorable. ""The Wicker Man"" was practically half a musical, with legendary parts like ""The Siren Song"" and ""Around the Maypole"", and I at least expected something similar here.","

Midsommar," The kind of horror that gives your mind a workout
",Mike_Devine,01-Feb-20,"On the heels of the deeply disturbing 'Hereditary,' Ari Aster returns with the equally unsettling Nordic nightmare that is 2019's 'Midsommar.'Graphic. Gruesome. Trippy. Twisted. All adjectives that can be used to describe this film. The events that unfold throughout can be interpreted in many different ways, but at the center of everything is a fractured relationship between the two young American twentysomethings - Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor). Unfortunately, the fragile bond that ties them together is not much of a match for the centuries-old barbaric rituals that take place during their summer adventure in a remote village in northern Sweden.Seeing how the relationship between Dani and Christian weathers the storm during their stay on this compound is something that doesn't really register until after the credits roll. 'Midsommar' messes with your mind and makes you question how things got to the way they end up. How much of the storyline is impacted by outside factors, and how much of it originates from within? This is a question that is up for much debate.But among the drug-fueled highs and the depressing lows of 'Midsommar' is the frighteningly beautiful fantasyland in which the film is set. The natural wonder of the Swedish (or Utahan) landscape sets an incredibly stark contrast from the horrors carried out by those who inhabit the area, and the incredible cinematography warps things even further. Maybe it's the midnight sun, maybe it's the use of color. Perhaps it's the use of sound (or lack thereof).

It is not a horror film in the same vein of Hereditary in the sense of how much a person will suffer and endure when all goes wrong around them.This film is a horror film in the sense that people will adjust to the situations around them in order to maintain sanity. Horrible situations will occur to everyone in their life and everyone will respond differently. Midsommar explores how and why a person would change their frame of mind. You start with one view of the world and those around you, and at the end of ""the experience"" you are left with yourself in the world - you happily accept where you are because that is the only place you can be at that moment.","

Midsommar," A bizarre documentary of a commune that doesn't exist, with nothing much to say and nothing much to show
",Dannov747,13-Feb-22,"This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It focuses a LOT on the bizarre rituals of a pagan cultist Swedish commune, but does so in a way that is neither interesting nor ominous. I was mostly left with the feeling of 'why do I care'. Sure some of the scenes are quite gruesome but it takes more than that to unsettle or scare the viewer.This movie cannot get dread and atmosphere right at all so its never scary. But is it fun? It wastes a lot of time behaving as almost a documentary for a culture that doesn't exist so no, its neither fun nor does it show you or tell you something new. Is the plot good? No its actually overly simplistic. Do the characters behave realistically? Definitely not, it takes the worst of horror movies and makes the characters act like imbeciles. Actually, in its final scene it goes a step further and basically makes the main character behave like a total clown.Some people have compared this to hereditary but that movie was a masterpiece in foreshadowing, dread, and plot development. And so while the endings of the movies are quite similar, Hereditary is burned into my mind, whereas Midsommar was just yawn inducing. It doesn't help that its nearly 2 and a half hours long. Please spend your time elsewhere.Rating: 3/10

Midsommar," Interesting
",acedj,21-Jan-20,"A group comprised of three friends and one of their girlfriends goes to Sweden to witness and take part in a pagan ritual that is celebrated once every 90 years. As the ritual progresses we see the American visitors coming under duress and having terrible things happen to them. That is the movie in a nutshell. I watched this for a couple of reasons. I love Florence Pugh. I think she is as talented an actor as she is beautiful. I had also heard some very good things about the movie. This has been marketed as a horror movie, and my friends, this it is not. I would say that there are some tense moments that would make this a thriller/drama. There is little here in the way of suspense as you can pretty much forecast the fate of the outsiders. I feel that they were going for a better, updated version of the wicker man and they did accomplish both, but with less drama. This is still a good movie with some interesting story points. I would probably not watch it again and would definitely not call it a horror movie. My apologies to Ash from Whatculture, as I know she had included this in some of her horror movie lists.","

Midsommar," One of the worst movies ever
",steven_kearns,27-Oct-19,"This is possibly the worst film I have ever seen. It seems to be a new concept, widely accepted by Millennials, that if something is bizarre and viewed as awful by the majority then they must support it and call it the greatest thing ever.For a start it is not a horror movie but a psychological thriller albeit a very, very, very slow one. There are entire portions of the movie spanning 30-40 minutes where literally nothing happens.Having arrived at their weird Swedish friends hometown 3 of them have disappeared within 48 hours and none of the cast seem to have a problem with this. When talking about someone being missing they ask ""oh where is she?"" Someone responds I saw her running screaming earlier, to which the completely not guilty (wink wink ) townsperson advises no I drove her into town and they just accept it!! It is utterly ridiculous.After witnessing 2 people jump off a cliff and die, one quickly and the other after a few smashes to the head with a wooden sledgehammer because he survived the fall they start screaming and want to leave but then are easily satiated when their friend tells them oh it's a tradition. Ok that's fine we don't mind people jump to their deaths at a certain age then being finished off by wooden hammer because we love tradition after all.So 3 friends missing, people jumping off cliffs and then getting beat to death, possibly being surrounded by the weirdest cult you will ever see, whilst in a remote location but yeah let's stay here another night.The cult then start singing and making random noses for literally 2 hours of the movie and not a great deal else happens. The scenes I have described are about 10-15 minutes of this film with the rest mostly being filled by people sitting, staring, making weird noses, dancing around maypoles and eating the most disgusting looking food you will ever see. That's really it.I cannot overstate how mind numbingly boring this movie is. At all costs do not watch this thinking it is a horror movie, it's not. I seriously considered breaking up with my girlfriend for making me stay to the end, yes it really is that bad.","

Midsommar," Weird and sometimes scary in the scandinavian midnight sun
",rehams,22-Dec-23,"This was a weird, but entertaining horror flick, that popped up on my danish TV app.As a dane, and thus a real life neighbor to the swedish settting in the film, it was quite entertaining to watch this Hollywood take on Midsommar, that pagan leftover in swedish culture, something that we danes no longer celebrate.The film is quite uneven and requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. Some scenes and traditions of the Hågra are too random to not have set off our protagonists in real life.Said protagonists are paper thin in the film, it's all about the Hågra and the setting.I will say this film is interesting from a scandinavian perspective, because it features a lot of swedish actors and a lot of blonde people. This still being normal here, particularly in places like rural Sweden.However, from an american point of view, that is increasingly diverse, I can see how this ""land of the blondes"" might seem very foreign. I found this reverse exocitism interesting to think about.Overall, I found the movie unnerving in parts, humorous in others. Well worth a watch.","

Midsommar," No Swedish Delight
",jadepietro,10-Jul-19,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Artfully made but absurd in its narrative, this psychological thriller about pagan rituals and bad romance wears one out. The Swedes should sue.JIM'S REVIEW: Ari Aster's psychological horror thriller, Midsommar, is this talented director's sophomore film, his second full-length feature, but this time, he allows his excesses to get the better of him. The director in him is still very astute and resourceful, piling on impressive surreal images and a purposeful sense of dread. However, the writer in him is in need of major guidance. His film is all set-up and no pay-off.It's deja vu, horror redux and repackaged. The director's screenplay rips off other movies from the horror genre and ends up disappointing in comparison. His previous film, Hereditary, had a similar effect, but that film was at least original and compelling. This one, relies too heavily on obvious troves from Hostel (students being maimed and tortured on a student trip), The Stepford Wives (a community that is not what it appears to be), The Village and Get Out (a community of followers with a hidden agenda), Rosemary's Baby (a coven of evil), Suspiria (another coven of evil with supernatural forces), and especially The Wicker Man (yet another coven of evil with supernatural forces and pagan rituals). Add to this rehash, lots of blood and gore and it makes for a rather unpleasant, if tension-filled, moviegoing experience.Not that all films need to be strictly entertaining and upbeat, but Mr. Asher's obsesses with slasher elements and shock value to make his point about the hazards of sustaining a dysfunctional relationship. His story involves a young couple named Christian (a less-than-subtle name) and Dani. a woman with some bouts of deep mental anguish), who are trying to salvage their romance...at least Dani is. Christian is ready to call it quits and go off on a European vacation with his buds, Mark and Josh, to a idyllic commune with their Swedish friend Pelle to attend a 90 year midsummer celebration. Christian mistakingly invites his soon-to-be ex to join them. Beware a woman scorned!This revenge fantasy clocks in at nearly two and a half hours and Mr. Aster takes his time to establish his stock characters and soak up the atmosphere. (A pre-credit prologue gives a backstory to one of the central characters, but it really is not all that necessary to the film's plot.) While suspense is a mainstay, the script is in dire need of rewrites, some judicious editing, and, most importantly, clarity. One wonders why these lambs to the slaughter are so dense that they are incapable of catching any clues to their dangerous journey from the outset. (Just looking at the artwork on the walls is more than a hint at the danger than is their destiny.) Their non-plussed reactions after a particularly grisly ritual makes no sense at all. (All book sense and no common sense, as my father would have called it.) Sex, youthful folly, and hallucinatory drugs can only justify so much for the lack of logic and the willingness to stay there.What the film has at its core is a strong performance by Florence Pugh as Dani. (The director was lucky to have that lightning strike twice, as his previous film debut had a riveting lead performance by Toni Collette as well.) Ms. Puhl takes on this emotional role with a self-assured presence. She shows her characters inherent flaws, vulnerability, and her unhinged nature. Jack Reynor as her handsome boyfriend is an interesting foil and depicts a self-centered millennial quite accurately. As his friends, William Jackson Harper, Vihelm Blomgren, and Will Poulter make the most of their underwritten roles of college intellectual. laid-back foreign graduate student, and sex-driven jock, disrespectfully.Visually, the film is a stunner. Pawel Pogorzelski's photography heightens the eerie uncertainty as he contrasts the brightly-lit countryside with the darker goings-on. (Loved the 360 degree angled road trip, aerial shots, and the fluidity and multiple movements of flora during the drug-induced sessions.) Along with Andrea Flesch's peasant tribal costumes with their intricate embroidery and Bobby Krlic's electronic folk-tinged atonal musical score, the look of the film resembles a pretty utopia that goes askew rather quickly.Mr. Aster's vision of a bizarre world keeps one's attention fixed at the atmospheric details and foregone omens, but his script that loses its way. The story becomes progressively absurd as more of the mystery is slowly revealed and the plot just leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion which caused more titters and groans than real fear and genuine scares from my movie audience.Despite all of the artistry involved, Midsommar is half baked horror. Mr. Aster's film starts off very effectively as it follows the recipe for suspense but the far-fetched story has too many overripe moments and wallows in its own pretentiousness. It's well made schlock, served piping hot. Just not to my taste.","

Midsommar," Long Winded, Pretentious, but Not Mindless Horror Flick
",Breumaster,14-Feb-20,"The movie beginns very slow and that's the speed over the whole playtime. When some young people travel to a nativ cult in sweden, they have no clue whats waiting for them. It's a story about a fictional teutonic cult that celebrate a nativ cult ritual, which happens to occur every 90 years. Beginning with some drug intoxication, many people may guess where it ends. This is a very bright and friedly atmosphered horror movie, which becomes bloody, and visually clearly gory in several scenes. The story slowly developes and progresses over the whole playtime. The characters slide into the story deeper and deeper and that's not only because of the acting, the technical aspects of that movie allow the audience, to easily glide into the storyflow. There are many strong visual scenes, that match with a hypnotic score. So the hole movie slows the audience down while telling the story. It didn't really feel like 2 hours and 27 minutes, because I was so slowed down myself.I wouldn't call it a real new invention of the horror gere. There are some pretty good horror movies that formerly were made in Scandinavia. 'Midsommar' is not really an excellent movie, but also not mediocre. I've seen a bunch of compareable movies before. 'The Wicker Man' from 70's dealt with such a scenario close to 46 years earlier. All in all I like the atmosphere, so it's a recommendation.","

There is no way the movie needs to be 2h30 minutes long with nothing really happening just over half of the movie. From Swedish point of view, I didnt find any related to the country or culture rather having ""strange language and country"" that would appeal to US viewers.

Midsommar," Perfect in every single way.
",niels2765,09-Feb-20,"Midsommar is a 2019 horror film directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary) and stars Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor as a dysfunctional couple who travel to Sweden to visit the Midsommar festival. This festival, located in a quaint Swedish village quickly turns into an unsettling and violent holiday, hosted by a pagan cult.It's very hard to achieve a perfect 10/10 score from me. The film has to be perfect in every aspect, both technically, and story-wise. Midsommar is a perfect film. Every single act, every single scene, every single shot... is perfect. I watched this film for my second time last night, yet this time I watched the director's cut, still perfect. But just what makes this film so good?The film stays clear of horror cliches. No lazy jump scares and no stupid exposition to keep the plot going, just a genuine film, that is written brilliantly by Ari Aster. The film has clear inspiration from other horror films, which seems to be a common criticism among the audience members, but why should that be a criticism? The film is still original, yes it takes some plot devices from other films, and yes some shots/scenes may be inspired, but why does that matter? Every film has inspirations, every film will have occasions where it may not be original. Besides the point, Midsommar takes these inspirations and just improves on them.Florence Pugh's performance is the best of this year. No argument. She is stunning. One of the best modern actresses today. She is outstanding in what may be the greatest horror film performance of all time. The rest of the class is just phenomenal. Will Poulter manages to bring humour into such a horrific, eerie story, and Jack Reynor really makes his and Florence Pugh's character's relationship so alive.The film's cinematography was also, the best of this year. So gorgeous, and how almost this whole film is shot in natural light, and during day time, is genius. The film leaves me in dismay and shock, despite it being a horror film, shot in the daytime. I loved the use of natural light, and the cinematography again is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Each shot gives me a sense of discomfort and manages to unsettle me. So damn creative as well. Goddamnit just thinking about the cinematography makes me want to cry of happiness.The score is the best of this year easily. Bobby Krlic creates a score that incorporates elements of Swedish folk music that proves to be horrifically hopeless. The score somehow stands out to the already unbelievable film. Take a listen to the score. Please. The score is so soothing, so delightful, yet behind such a disgustingly gory and disturbing film.The film's story is fantastic. A great narrative, with deeper meaning. I loved watching this film a second time. I could interpret the film any way I wanted to. The movie is a slow burn, much like Ari Aster's previous work Hereditary (2018). I slowly watched everything go to crap, and I loved it. The film is a perfect cult movie. Watch it. Now.","

Midsommar," Very Artistic Movie About Grief
",sweidman-28016,11-Jul-19,"Midsommar Review:Midsommar is written and directed by Ari Aster, the same guy who wrote and directed Hereditary (one of my favorite films), and follows a struggling couple who travel to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult. This was my third most anticipated movie of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of last year and I think it's an absolute masterpiece. This is definitely different from what I expected to see. Hereditary is a horror film about dealing with grief, and a bunch of other stuff that happens with supernatural cult stuff. I wouldn't consider Midsommar a horror movie at all. I think it's more of a drama with a little thriller stuff thrown in. It's more about Dani, played by Florence Pugh, and her failing relationship with Christian, played by Jack Reynor, all the while trying to deal with a recent tragedy. I should add that Jack Reynor did a good job as a horrible boyfriend and also a shocked man discovering everything that's happening. I think it shouldn't have been marketed or branded with the horror genre. It's not a huge problem it's just that after Hereditary and all the trailers for this most were probably expecting a horror movie. That being said it's not a bad movie. The plot is intriguing. It's more artistic and not for everyone. I think me and my friend were the only ones who actually enjoyed it out of everyone in the theater. Most people said ""Well that was stupid"" when it finished. I totally understand if anyone doesn't like it. The first hour I was debating if I liked it because nothing really happened. On an artistic level the first hour was good but not much happened. It was mostly the group getting high and sitting around before the festival. I thought everyone did a good job. Will Poulter played the funny one and he had many great one-liners. William Jackson Harper, just like his role in The Good Place, plays a serious guy and I enjoyed his character. He was most interested in the culture of these people. Once the festival begins things start to get more interesting and there's a sense of something being off. We all know everyone there is in a cult but we're confused on what they're going to do. Once the first most remotely ""scary"" part of the movie happens the rest of the ""scares"" are based mostly on shock value. One thing that might make people think this is dumb is the cult has many weird rituals that make us laugh in awkwardness. From what I read and know it was meant to be awkward so it wasn't just poorly done. I thought there were many shocking things that happen. That is all thanks to Florence Pugh. She is really good. They were saying that she was going full on Toni Collette in Hereditary but I don't think those two can be compared with the whole different plots. I thought Pugh portrayed a person dealing with grief perfectly. The opening tragedy scene we just hear her voice over a phone call and I thought it was just heartbreaking. The slow takes throughout, especially during that scene, added effect with some suspense and just making it like the audience is there discovering what is happening. May I add the cinematography was beautiful. It was brightly colored with pastels and there wasn't a shot, no matter how disturbing and shocking it was, that looked bad. Aster wanted pretty, light colors because there aren't many horror movies that have that look. There was always a sense of peacefulness throughout. It was honestly a calming movie that also wasn't at the same time. It's a very weird tone that I liked. The very end was such an interesting sense. Aster also likes a loud, beautiful song while something horrible yet joyous is happening. I really like that. The score by Bobby Krlic is good. Once again very peaceful and really pretty at times. This is a hard movie to write a review about. It's definitely one that needs an analysis and to be honest I haven't read one yet. I might be seeing it again and I might pick up on things I didn't the first time. I know there's lots of foreshadowing with these paintings and pictures in the background and plainly there for the audience to see. I found some that I noticed later and I want to know more. Overall it's a very interesting movie. Ari Aster went through a breakup and this is his way of writing it out on paper as he puts it. I can definitely see how that life event shaped this. That's really the meaning of the movie. Life events shape our lives. If you're not one for slow paced, artistic, strange movies this isn't for you. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. It's more aimed for a specific group. I did enjoy it, not as much as Hereditary though so I guess I was expecting just a little more. Not that it's bad I just had different expectations. If you plan on seeing it just don't expect a single thing. That will help for a better viewing experience.My Grade: B","

",shahrad,20-Jun-20,"A24 is an independent company mostly responsible for releasing some important horror movies lately. I had Midsommar in my watch list for quite a while.
Well, having to watch Wicker Man and some other cult movies in the genre, the storyline was somehow predictable to me while I found the pagan rituals too much as well as some unnecessary graphic scenes and typically constant idiocy of the protagonists. No sign of a plausible twist or a surprising turn. However, it was an entertaining horror flick for the weekend. 4/10","

Midsommar," I'd rather babysit Greta Thunberg for two and half hours. That sounds kind of fun actually...
",GiraffeDoor,03-Apr-20,"I feel very similarly about this movie than I did with Hereditary (by the same writer).I feel this could have been a majestic, compact, efficient 90 minute chiller that was a masterpiece of its genre. But sadly, this movie drowns in its own over ambition with way too much thrown at us and the ultimate effect is portentous, heavy-handed and messy.The detail in realizing the picture is certainly very impressive: the rich sense of place and local color alone could almost have made this movie worth seeing if it had been 25% shorter. In short, the thing looks fantastic and very professional (until it gets confident but I'll get to that).Ari Aster is... a lot like David Lynch. By this I mean that he is a film maker that has a marvellous imagination, a rich mind for stories and a certain boldness that some people think has gone in horror. But he really, really needs to learn how to self edit. He is surrounded by too many yes-man (and women) for some reason. Like Hereditary, it's hard to verbalize exactly what is wrong with this movie because it takes the form of so many little things that wreck the mood like wrong notes in an otherwise well composed piece of music. Seriously, someone who could say to him ""Ari, baby, you're script, she's phenomenal! Just take out this, this, this, this, that and replace this with something less convoluted and we've got gold!"".The first 20 minutes alone gave me so much to chew on: the way that tetraptych flies open like it's a preschooler's show; the way they cut away from the intense Nordic Winter with that phone ringing as if it were a teen comedy. The word ""scary"" twice! (show don't tell) and then something I've been seeing in more and more horror movies that really gets to me: we begin with a something horrible happening. Which would be fine except it *has nothing to do with the rest of the frickin' movie*. And no, don't try to tell me that it's thematic and part of the character's journey. This movie had 150 minutes to sell this to me and I still don't buy it. Dani Is a bland, one dimensional character with no personality beyond feeling sorry for herself which she has every right to do, given the circumstances, but it makes for tedious cinema. She is not an interesting protagonist. That should have been Chidi. He is the one character who really feels like a character, rather than target practice and the acting probably played a part in that.A better writer wouldn't have killed off Dani's family. They simply would have shown that she was alienated from them but tied to them through guilt or co-dependence and used the movie to try and develop her character. The need to kill her family to untie her was a lazy move and means the movie blows its load in the first act. In short: I simply do not care about Dani or her plight and by extension I really have no opinion on Christian. He's just kind of there.There are other certain bizarre cinematic choices. These include a strange obsession with reflections which might have been atmospheric if they'd spaced them out more but there's two counts of this in the first act where someone talks to someone off screen but we see their reflection...if there might have been good if there were some theme of self discovery in this movie, but there really isn't any more than any movie. Like I have said before, Dani doesn't change or develop; she doesn't do things, things happen to her. Another time, they match-cut going into one room and into another...it's so obvious they used a trick set it ruins the mood. And when the camera says ""screw it"" and goes upside down...now I'm a sucker for stylized cinematography but there needs to be a physical justification for it. Maybe a character leaned back and saw the world upside down for a moment...but no...ellipsis, ellipsis, ellipsis....Another issue is how it seems to be Dani's story and yet we keep pulling away from her. But she annoys me so I'm not sure how much of an issue this really is.The film is a blur of excessive plot points, obnoxious characterisation and misjudged dialogue. I don't care about Dani. I just don't and she is played irritatingly by Pugh. I really do not care to see her in anything else but I guess we all deserve a second chance because who on earth could breathe life into this character?The thing I really like about this picture is curiously the thing everyone who likes it hates: the slow atmospheric scenes where you can't resist the sense that some unseen terror is coming. We so don't get enough of that in horror, not now, not in yesteryear. It does feel a lot like rip off of Wicker Man sometimes but that's it's strongest element. And that sinks in all the other stuff...On that note: you know how sometimes a movie is low budget and simple but because it's original and efficiently made it resonates with new generation after new generation. Then there is a lavish, big budget remake in which so much talent goes into it but it is nowhere near as fondly remembered because it just lacked any of the finesse the first one had? I feel this movie is the grandiose, tinsel town remake to a classic that never was. I'm really hoping that one day this will get its own make-under remake. Everything else is getting remade...And the ending...well, I won't spoil it but wowee I have not been ticked off at an ending so much since Knock Knock. I raised my middle finger to the end credits and told movie exactly what I think of it. The thing is...conceptually it could work, it really could. But the smug handling and the shameless padding of time as if the story has more to say and then doesn't really makes me feel like I am being taken for a ride by someone who convinced they're much more of a genius than they really are.In conclusion, some magnificent film making is wasted, even ruined, in a hubristic attempt to make what could have been an admirable horror movie into an exploration of the human condition. An expertly made cake with 3 grams of human excrement is still a bad cake, and that is sort of how I feel about this movie.I did stick with it for the full 150 minutes to be fair and I'm sure there was fun along the way (best sex scene ever...) but my final emotion was not boredom or frustration but white hot anger. You'll understand why when you see it. Or maybe not...Fudge this movie. I love that it's trying to be something beyond the cookie cutter teen scream horror but a film needs to do more than look the part.","

Midsommar," When Artsy, Edgy, and Cool Goes Wrong
",tvdefrancesco,06-Jul-19,"Why do so many movies and TV shows nowadays try to be edgy and leave things unexplained with abrupt endings?! Unfortunately this isn't even the worst thing about Midsommar. I was really excited to see this movie and it was absolutely horrible.
The main character is the worst character I have ever seen. It wasn't the actress's fault either. 80% of her lines are howling and crying. They make her seem terrible to be around and no one liked her, not even her boyfriend. Her whole family dies at the beginning, but that is never explained. I kept thinking they would tie it back but they didn't.
For the next 2 1/2 hours we slowly move up to nothing. They show a disabled person here and there, and 1 of them writes stuff, but never explain. They show 1 over and over but never incorporate it. More howling and tripping then burn alive. More stares no explanation then howling then over. Thankfully fin.","

Midsommar," a director who happens to like artistic gore accidentally finds a niche in the horror film industry? yes, believe that
",idontknowiknowthatidontknow,26-Jul-19,"I should've known after seeing hereditary that this director likes dramatic music with gory scenes. He just likes good cinematography and gore. That's ok, but my problem is the high rating the movie watching community gives him. So far this midsommar film is at a 7.7. Now, i perfectly understand why he gets such a high score for such non sense. people in general rate a movie higher when it takes itself seriously(from the beginning to the end), when there are strange visual objects(the triangular building) and when the subjects of the film act seriously. also when its a bit of a strange plot. But the thing is this director is a one trick pony. There's no suspense in his film like hitchcock(think of the scene in psycho where the lady crossing the road in the beginning recognizes the driver)those scenes that makes you perk up for a moment. There's no ultimate sense of satisfaction in a film(comes in many forms, too many examples to mention). There's no actual scare or horror in his film.(think of when silence of the lambs Hopkins escapes his jailer, there's a moment of horror. think of when in psycho the mom comes from upstairs really quickly and stabs a person, that's a scare.) again, there's none of those scares or horror in this film. i saw the plot pretty early, they are all getting whacked one by one. There's probably one flicker of light that flickered for a moment, it's when they showed that grotesque inbred creature for the first time. For some reason when i first saw him, my movie mind took me to a place of films from the 70's era, where dark creatures devoured human subjects in films. I thought the film would expound of his character, but not at all. And then, the elephant in the room, show gore visuals of people getting whacked, i don't know if there's a sadistic group of gore movie fans that have formed to follow this movie director around, but i don't see why they would. if i want to see gore, i can go to these websites and see mexican drug cartels blow some's head half off with a shotgun up close. Thus this director fails, and yet he has somehow found a niche where he now resides. he hasn't shown me anything yet other than he likes to treat his film seriously and show lots of gore.","

Midsommar," Garbage with some beautiful frames
",bilieliyot,23-Jan-21,"I apologize to the fans of Ari Aster, but I didn't like this movie. There are two things that I appreciated: (1) the shooting technique of the car ride scene, which I was already familiar with thanks to Hereditary, the first of movie of Ari Aster, and (2) the beautiful landscape of Sweden!The movie has been categorized as horror/thriller, but I disagree. There are at most 3 disturbing scenes, but that's unfortunately not enough to thrill you. On top, Ari Aster inflated the script with cliches that we have seen many times in other horror movies, and consequently, anybody who has spent a bit of time with movies can easily guess what will happen in the next scene.As I said, the only thing I like about this movie is the cinematograpy, which is not really the success of this movie, it's rather the beautiful nature in Sweden. This usually occurs to me when I watch Woody Allen movies; every frame is like a painting that you might consider hang on your wall, but the rest is garbage.","

Midsommar," It's the bear's fault
",daisukereds,29-Sep-19,"This is an introspective story of a person that goes from a bad state of mind, to a better one under worse conditions (depending on who you are asking). Groups and tribes can behave strangely due to culture and beliefs, and anyone can judge them as desired! Is good really good and bad really bad? In truth, this is not a one dimensional, and a lot can be discussed about it. Specially when you give a depressed and lonely person a revelation they are willing to accept while improving her life(?), while at the same time not being capable of truly understanding it.I'll be frank, I didn't particularly enjoyed this movie.The main protagonist's suffering is understandable, but I found it hard to get emotionally invested in her (I tend to dislike weaker and manipulable characters) or any of the rest of the cast. So, sadly, I don't think anything in it pays off at the end. Specially since the movie is constantly showing contradictions and there's no clear message.I gave it a lower score because it is not completely incompetent.. at least in cinematography. There are some good set-design choices, and some good shots. But, did it have to be over 2 hours long? Can't really say nothing happens, but the pacing is too slow for my taste, and it is too boring to be entertaining. Everything is too cut and dry : If something seems to go wrong, it goes wrong immediately.I wouldn't watch it again. And not sure if I could recommend it.","

Midsommar," Riveting
",jennydeane,07-Mar-20,"This movie is just brilliant. There are so many complex layers to what is going on here - at face value you could think of it as a trippy, bizarre adult fairy tale. But when you dig deeper, you'll find a lot more under the surface.I initially thought the opening was an emotional ploy to help us empathize with Dani, but now I see it is the thesis of the entire movie. Ari Aster himself said it was an ""operatic break up movie"" and that is a perfect description. Through her personal tragedies, Dani finds meaning and community again - she finds people to hold her, to cry with her - things she should have had all along.The cult setting is clever - it's ritualistic shock and gore at every step, seeming to underline Dani's heightened sense of foreboding and horror and her struggle to process the tragedy with her family and with Christian. But by the end of the movie, Dani embraces the ritualized gore and sees it's necessary for moving on (in more than just one sense). The cult has shown her how to cope and given her a community to do so. Their tragedies are planned and measured; they have responsibility for their own traumas. It's pure art.It's a raw, sometimes uncomfortable roller coaster ride that gives you plenty to chew on. 10/10","

Midsommar," Shallow, Empty, Pointless
",Krog__,13-Jul-19,"A shallow and empty exercise that mistakes vagueness for complexity and change for character work. The opening 10-20 minutes of the film is brutal; extremely well made and extremely true to life, but completely unnecessary and somewhat contradictory to the main points of the rest of the movie. Then we move into a slow burn look at a group of friends as they travel to Sweden to visit what they slowly discover is a murderous cult. Slow burns work best when there is mystery present, when the audience has questions they want answered. This movie doesn't have that. The characters are mostly *less* than two dimensional, other than the boyfriend who is an interesting character to watch but awful person. Every one of the main characters acts against what we know about them; this is especially rough in the climax where an important female character makes a decision that doesn't fit what we know about her at all (although the fact that all of the friends stayed after a horrific act occurs early on already destroys any sense of character that exists). There's also a character with a disability put there entirely to be ""weird""; way to go, filmmakers - let's use a disability to show how weird these people are.Shallow, empty, pointless - but apparently well-researched, so I guess that's something to think about during the 2 1/2 hour runtime","

Midsommar," Unbereable, absurd nonsense from start to end..
",charymuradovich,01-Feb-22,"From the guy called Hetvi Shah on google!I like almost any movie, even the ones that are not really great... But this is the kind of nonsense movie where everything is absurd, from the script to the characters, situations... Nothing left to like. It's sopposed to be a 'psicological terryfing thriller' or something like that, but it's more like psicological nonsense, high on drugs and cults or something like that without telling any story. Characters didn't have a motivation for anything, so what the hell, let's strech it to 2 and a half hours. Come on! All of the people who enjoy the film praise it for the cinematography, which was uninspired, for it's breaching of multiple genres, which was done but rather poorly, and for being about the breakup, not just the horror, which, it was, but had a ridiculous stance on the break up.The positives in the film were the acting and the FX department. I wish I could give credit to the production designer but putting the tune for sacrifice on the sacrificial character's costume isn't clever, it's tacky. It's like having a name tag saying ""Hi, my name is Murderer"" in a slasher film. The lighting decision to have a horror film be in broad daylight is neither original (Wicker Man) nor well done (it is very straightforward camera angles other than a singular upside down windshield shot).The breaching of multiple genres is a good thing and could be praised, if it was done in a way that complimented the strengths of the genres involved and conveyed the message. Neither of these happened. Instead, random lines of humor were included interspersed between gratuitously graphic on screen killings. Then there were completley purposeless orgy sequences with explicit nudity that I have read were included as comic relief according to the director. How is disgusting nudity of about 15 elderly women for a full minute on screen funny? Are you trying to shock us into laughter because we have no other way to respond to something so depraved? And if it wasn't meant for comedy (even though Aster publicly said it was) then what could have been the purpose when the same plot point could have been covered by them being clothed onlookers? The perversion and level of gratuitous filth in this movie were terrible, but the fact that they didn't even progress the story or theme was what was the most disturbing part. It wasn't even for something valuable to the production.Lastly, this whole 'its really a break up movie' gimmick could have been okay, if you weren't asking us to side with the girl who murdered her partner of 3 and a half years instead of a cult member who has killed all of her friends. And what was the boyfriend's crime? Wanting out of a relationship that was toxic, but waiting to break up because the girls entire family just died? I get that he is a jerk about the thesis thing, but in terms of the relationship, he was beyond supportive. She was the one who cheated with the swedish friend first and who accused him of forgetting her birthday, which, he actually didn't do. So what exactly is Aster wanting us to enjoy about his take on the break up where the 'heroine' murdered the one person who didn't think he should break up with her right after she lost three family members?Beyond all of that, the movie was underwhelming in terms of scares or terror. It was neither a thriller nor a collection of jump scares or chase scenes. Now those have been done to death (pun intended) by the horror genre, but what was scary in this movie? The people killing themselves of their own volition? The off screen disappearances?I was disgusted by the depravity of this film and entirely disappointed in it's lack of any statement about the views or choices of the characters or situation. It was a movie with plot points and then it ended.Worst movie!!","

",jenniferlynn-49555,03-Oct-19,"And then I watched it. What the hell is going on here? I gave it two stars because the visuals are really good. Costume, gore was realistic, beautiful scenery, and the trips were well done.
Now the bad, which is basically everything else. The movie was pretty dead up until the first head crack, face smash in the rock, which happened at an hour in. So for a whole hour the girl is crying, complaining and being so insecure it was annoying. Why did she even go on the trip, why did the friends let her if they hated her so much? If I was planning a girls trip and one friends annoying, needy boyfriend hopped on at the last minute, I would have something to say. Nothing these people did was logical. Weird creepy cult or not. Friends disappear, no one is concerned. Find a red hot pubey in your soup and you know who did it but continue eating and drinking. Grandma and Grandpa jump to their death and everyone still stays. Grandpa did it wrong, so the other children of the corn, helped him out, not once, not twice but a few times. Yeah I think you got him. The weird love making scene.... I was shocked and I also laughed. All the moaning and screaming while some weirdo physically helps you out because let's face it, they're tired of screaming. When the friend gets it, for taking pictures of the coloring book/Bible, the sloth from Goonies, pulls a house of wax/ house of a 1000 corpses and is wearing another person's face. I honestly just don't know what else to say. It was pretty at times to look at but it was ""Mother"" kind of weird..

Midsommar," A surrealistic look at what it means to hurt the ones you should care for
",cory_j_adams,04-Jan-20,"First and foremost, let me start off by saying that this film will definitely not be for everyone. Most people who see this film will more than likely not understand what it's saying, which is fine. That's part of the beauty of cinema, it's subjective. And people are entitled to their own opinions.In my personal experience with this film, Midsommar effected me greatly. The first time I saw it I found it bizarre and grandiose, surreal and visceral. The kind of film that is saying something, but not so loudly that it overwhelms you with it's themes. In fact, it more so invites you to discover what it's saying. And it says a lot. I saw the film 3 times in theaters and I feel like I still haven't grasped entirely what the film means because much of it is very ambiguous. Ari Aster is smart in the regard that he knows what we don't see is much more terrifying than what we do. With that being said, I don't know if I would necessarily categorize this film as a horror movie. It's more of a psychological drama with elements of horror. But genre is merely a pigeonhole that we place films in based on how they make us feel. Regardless of genre, Mr. Aster has made a supremely effective look at a victim's complicated response to those who have hurt her.Visually, this film is a feast for the eyes. I don't think I've seen a better looking film in 2019 (besides The Lighthouse but in an entirely different fashion). It's use of color and lighting pretty much engulfs the viewer in this strange world that our protagonists have entered. It's some of the finest cinematography I've seen all year. The camerawork is very seamless and vast, as if painting a picture for us. Revealing things through use of imagery is no small task, but Aster and his cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, pull this task off almost flawlessly (which is why I recommend multiple viewings of this film. It has a lot to say through its use of imagery. I'm sure there are some things I still haven't noticed and I've seen the film about 5 times now). This is awards-worthy work from this cinematographer, and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves.The costume and set design also thoroughly impress, with the small commune appearing to be a world uncorrupted by the outside. We're meant to be fascinated and fearful of this place and the design of the buildings and structures as well as the way they're presented evoke these responses effortlessly. It makes us wonder what's going on behind the walls of the sacred temples that appear so strange to us.The script for the film is also impressive, though I will say it is definitely not to the magnitude of what Aster did with Hereditary. But Hereditary is entirely different monster altogether. That film was what I would call claustrophobic. This film is vast and wide. Sparking our curiosity while also simultaneously alerting us that a certain danger lurks just beneath the bright exterior. One critic commented that this film is staged more like an opera than a horror film, and I wholeheartedly agree. This is a very well written film but instead of assaulting us with its themes it asks us to look for them ourselves. To interpret them in our own way, which is one of my favorite things about this film (though I can understand why some audiences will be turned off by this).Now let me get to my favorite aspect of any film: the acting. I'll start off first with the woman at the center of it all, Miss Florence Pugh. I've been watching her ever since I saw her impressive debut in 2016's Lady Macbeth, where she delivered one of the most unnerving performances I've ever seen given by an actress. Here she delivers one of the most vivid performances of the year. In every scene she's in in this film, she is open and vulnerable. As if she has no where that she can hide what she's feeling. And in a way, she doesn't. She's a fountain of emotion, sometimes bursting with an energy that fills the entire screen. It's a mesmerizing performance that allows her to put her full range on display. The supporting players are also very good, with Will Poulter in particular being a standout for providing much needed comic relief (making this film actually surprisingly hilarious at times). Jack Reynor also holds his own as the manipulative boyfriend who doesn't know when to leave well enough alone. Vilhelm Blomgren as their native Swedish friend, also impresses, his performance being sympathetic while also being entirely enigmatic. And William Jackson Harper (of Good Place fame) gives only what I can call a driven performance, advancing the plot towards the insane finale that we all know is coming.Some people have said that they have found the film tedious and with a few plot holes and I can see why. Some things are left ambiguous, but not outright unanswered. And I think that's the point. It's all part of what your interpretation is.Regardless of it's flaws, Midsommar is a complex study on grief and trauma. It will effect many viewers (some more than others), and will more than likely be a film that will be talked about years from now as a cinematic phenomenon that people will always be entranced by (similar to Kubrick's The Shining). And though it's not outright scary, it will unnerve you. Which is almost better than being scared.","

Midsommar," Style AND Substance: Harrowing and uneasy from the very beginning
",Amthermandes,11-Jan-20,"The first 15 minutes set the mood for the rest of the film more perfectly than virtually almost every other movie I've ever seen. The acting along with the scene structure is so chilling in the first few scenes, it leaves the audience apprehensive the rest of the runtime. Brilliantly executed, it's hard to watch, but you can't help but watch it. Florence Pugh's wailing still haunts me in my nightmares. And that's just the beginning of the film.Who would have thought a movie with such a bright and aesthetically pleasing exterior could be so disturbing and alien inside? Midsommar is such a film. It's remarkable; like viewing a documentary on a culture from a different planet. The horror sets in quick, taking no pause. Along with the main characters, the viewers then take a strange plunge into the sunny depths of a ritualistic hell. There, relationships are tested, drugs are induced, and all that should be light and wholesome are revealed as dark and horrifying, especially to those unfamiliar to the customs of this ""village."" It's an unsettling ride, effective and well done on everyone's part, and I'm sure many will not be able to look at a beautiful bouquet of flowers the same way ever again.","

Midsommar," Great entry into the ""Folk Horror"" subgenre
",bangbang_yourhead,29-Jan-20,"Not sure what all of these bad reviews are for....probably written by people who have never appreciated films like the original Wicker Man. Very stylish, beautifully shot and very well done. It has some truly haunting imagery...anyone who says this isn't horror has a very narrow definition and pedestrian expectations. Suspenseful and makes you think about the nature of relationships as well as the power or religious belief over the human mind. Could also fall under the ""breakup movie"" and ""revenge film"" subgenres. One of my favorite more recent Horror/ Suspense/ Thrillers. There is a lot of black humor laced throughout and I found it intentionally funny at times (so buzz off: people commenting that there were laughs in the theater). The psychedelic episodes were enough to give anyone who has experienced hallucinogenic drugs a flashback. Only criticism is, like most (if not all) films of this nature, it relies on characters making poor decisions in order to advance the plot. But that is the nature of many a Horror film and you could argue those bad decisions and judgments are the crux of films like this. Comes across like a beautiful, folky, waking nightmare. Highly recommended.","

She jumps at the chance to join her anthropology student boyfriend Christian Hughes and his friends who are following Pelle to a Swedish commune.Ari Aster has made two feature length films so far, this and Hereditary. No one pushes the envelope that far, right out of the gate. He is a filmmaker worthy of the attention. As for this film, his skills are not to be questioned. This is an unsettling story. When that member says matter a factly ""It's a Bear"", that's the moment I'm looking for the exit. Dani may be looking for something and the students may be more obsessed with their paper. The whole situation is spooky. The expert filmmaking may be covering up the emotional devastation of Dani. That's the first priority of the movie. Instead of flashy camera moves, it would be better to tell the beginning much more naturalistically. Her depression is the film's journey and it needs to set off as straight as possible. She could also be more specific in her journey. Again, this has to be her movie. I do like her journey. I don't care as much about Christian. There is a lot of WTF moments.

Obviously based on Arian views on Women, for these Nordic girls innocence is an absolute requirement. Logically the dark side of the focus on fertility is sacrifice.The acting and art direction is top notch, which is unique for this genre.I'm kind of shocked by the many bad reviews.

",sgmi-53579,20-Oct-23,"If you've watched Ari Aster's Heteditary, you have a fair idea how he approaches his art. His latest features more slow burn horror, as twenty-something Dani suffers a severe trauma when her sister and parents are found dead; her boyfriend Christian invites her along with his friends, who are writing their thesis while traveling to a remote Swedish village - home to fellow student Pelle. Aster loves building tension, and he does so repeatedly, continually raising expectations that something just isn't right, including a rather effective tracking shot where their world is literally ""turned upside down."" There is gore to match some of the toughest slasher flicks, and lots of symbolism and cultural history packed into this feature, for those who might enjoy. It felt about thirty minutes too long for what it was trying to accomplish, and diluted it's payoff in the process. Horror fans may find themselves checking their watch a few times. It's smartly made, but lacks a central performance on the level of Heteditary's Toni Collette; but Midsommar remains an interesting and original picture that is sure to get people talking.

",hussein_bahaa12,30-Sep-20,"It is weird and useless.Our main characters were very helpless, they didn't behave as normal people would do, they didn't try to run away when they knew those people were cruel.I have been waiting till the end to get a clear answer for
who are those cruel people?
Where is the government from all this?
Unfourtiontly the movie did not answer for any of that.The acting was pretty cold didn't convince me the slightest.A piece of garbage movie except for the Cinematography, and magnificently charming landscape, which without it would have been impossible to watch those cruel scary, and stupid Rituals.","

Midsommar," The reversal of Hereditary
",thebadatgaming,05-Jul-19,"Midsommar is the sophmore premier of Ari Aster, and this is a complete 180 to Hereditary but they share similar themes. Definitely not as good as Hereditary but it is shot so great, and the story keeps unraveling and not revealing all of the secrets infront of you but in suble shots that dont make sense until the end. Certainly more like a mystery drama with some horrific gore and implications of the great causality of the events we see play out. As said, this is the total oppisite of Hereditary and its definitely not as deep and dark but as Hereditary but has the some of the same tones, just in very different settings. In all i would reccomend this film to as many others as I can and is definitely going high on the favorite horror of 2019 list.","

Midsommar," Horrifically Wonderful
",LnineB,09-Dec-19,"This is by far the best horror film I've seen in the past five or so years. I've actually seen it three times since it's release and will watch it again shortly after buying the extended version.This film isn't perfect. It could actually be a bit too long and the middle sequence after the mid-act climax is WAY too long for such an intense climax. With that said, there are a few things that completely make you forgive those mistakes.1. Florence Pugh's performance : She's absolutely amazing and captures the intricate details of a person's psyche after experiencing a traumatic event. Her performance also justifies her actions later in the film. We are constantly reminded that she is broken and fragile. In that state she could be easily manipulated and should'e been nurtured instead of patronized.2. The first sequence, Mid-climax and finale. Like I said earlier the parts in between these sequences are a bit too long but these scenes are masterful, especially the build-up to the middle sequence. Aster reminds us , in the beginning of this film , that TRUE horror comes in the form of depression, suicide, murder and supreme lost of a loved one. The beginning scene is almost too much to watch, especially if you've experienced similar horrific acts. The Mid-Climax is just simply horrific. There's nothing symbolic about it. It's just something that you almost don't want to see ever again. The ending is tamer in comparison to the first two sequences but it does successfully wraps up a surreal experience in the most perfect way.3. The cinematography: The beginning of the film is dark and appropriate for the theme,but the rest of the film, almost 2-1/2 hours of it , is represented in a wash of light and colors. It literally looks TOO perfect , of which is exactly the feeling you should get once you meet the cult. By the end of the film the light and colors become annoying. Too me that's a good thing, because, also by then, you are finding out how horrific of a setting the land is. This is a perfect way carrying out a concept through the details of a film.4. The deeper meaning: This is of course my interpretation but the deeper meaning of this film makes it a masterpiece. I've seen reviews saying that the film is unrealistic and that there is NO story or mystery in the film. I actually think the exact opposite. it's unrealistic to some because it's an analogy of something that is very REAL . The complete disconnect we as humans have with trauma is represented clearly in this film. The story to me is about this disconnect with trauma or the lack of meaningful relationships. This is the reason someone can be drawn to cults or negative influences. The supporting characters in this film represent the everyday reactions and responses to horrific trauma by a lot of people today (ie thoughts and prayers). The main character represents the person that is truly grieving and is often left alone or made to think that their grieving is actually wrong. To me this analogy makes this film VERY realistic and actually more scary than other horror films.I absolutely loved this film and can't wait to watch the extended version of it. It's the well crafted, thought provoking, type of horror that we need in this day and time. 8/10","

I also have to give props to Florence Pugh who delivered an incredible and I mean it, INCREDIBLE performance as the character Dani.

Midsommar," Not for fans of 'The Nun'
",dmbelafan,05-Oct-21,"There's not's much to say for people who are giving this 1-star ratings, other than there's no accounting for taste. If you prefer horror that spoon-feeds you an abundance of the unnatural and grotesque, then you'll be better served by other films.Midsommar is a powerhouse of unsettling storytelling. In a genre that relies on pitch black rooms and camera angles that obscure the jump scare coming around the corner, it instead thrusts the entire movie into bright sunlight. It doesn't need an unending stream of unexpected scares, because seeing them coming from a mile away actually works *better* and forces the viewer to sit helpless as they know (at least part of) what's coming. In a movie so intentionally contradictory, the moments lacking ambiguity feel obviously deceitful and put us on edge for the fate of the characters.As others have mentioned, the cinematography is outstanding. Dialogue feels very grounded, and the performances of the leads, especially Florence Pugh, are excellent. In addition, MY GOD the soundtrack - The Haxan Cloak (Bobby Krlic) deserves all the praise for his mix of atmospheric pieces mixed with bright, cheerful pieces when appropriate.This is not an obvious film. It treats its audience with respect and puts things in plain view while hiding its lies in plain sight. I would not go into this if you are in the mood for traditional horror - but I would gladly recommend it to any movie lover who simply wants to see a well-made film.","

Midsommar," Satire of Religion Masking as a Horror Film
",jmholmes-73727,05-Jul-19,"Can a movie be creepy, funny, horrifying and enormously entertaining throughout? This is the cornucopia of delights Ari Aster has produced in his second offering. Two ingredients that seem to have fueled his inspiration are, of course, the original British version of The. Wicker Man (quite an achievement itself) and the scores of Friday The 13th slasher movies where groups of youngsters go on a vacation to be killed off one by one. His movie rises to the level of the first and transcends the level of the second formula. One of the most remarkable things here is the first 20 minutes or so which create a traumatic situation that causes the young couple to appear annoying and psychologically questionable - so that as the story progresses we do not have the compassion for them that would otherwise make their ordeal unbearable to watch.
Important to note is that there is not one scare or ""jump moment"" in the entire movie. This is not a complaint, merely a warning to viewers who might see this as a failure, which, of course, it is not. The horror here, as it turns out, is all-pervasive and throughout all the bright sunny faces and clear landscape of the Swedish countryside. It is in the cult members' drinks, their food, their soil and their beliefs. The horror is in the way they live.
Hopefully Swedish people with a sense of humor will not be offended by the script's locale. It would be interesting to see how the movie ""plays"" in that country's press. One comes away from it eager to avoid the next chance one gets to attend a prayer service or join a group seeking some kind of so-called enlightenment - regardless of the country.
Hat's off to Ari Aster as he boldly goes down his dark, clever path.","

Midsommar," I was entertained!
",R_Alex_Jenkins,31-Mar-20,"If you look at the larger picture, the overall plot is unrealistic: a guy leads his American friends to their ultimate demise, which is never going to happen because of the wider implications for him and his entire community. This is not a video game and police do not miraculously forget about a group of missing persons, making the basic premise of the film somewhat ridiculous.But was I entertained, did I think about it afterwards and am I writing this brief review? Yes. And the more I think about it, it's almost horror genre gold. Gold in the sense of laughing out loud at a woman singing in a shrill voice while holding the hand of another female while literally getting ceremoniously fucked, but admittedly rolling my eyes and getting a bit bored by the end, but perhaps I'm just lucky at having watched junk TV on Netflix lately, which makes me appreciate the very slow pace and stupendous acting in this film while also understanding that it's not supposed to be serious or something you can draw real-life conclusions from, and also because I knew nothing about the film beforehand and had zero expectations.Entertaining, unexpected, but rather too long and quixotic for many people's tastes, but with references to Lars von Trier in a less sinister but more directly accessible and enjoyable format, to in-bred horror communities and classy Wrong Turns or even Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut or Harrison Ford in Witness. So inviting, and yet you wish you'd stayed away.","

Midsommar," MIDSOMMAR MURDERS ReVisits THE VILLAGE That Sacrifices Reality
",superman1,16-Mar-21,"ACT IAri Master starts sharp as a knife glinting on characters' faces. The depth and expression underlying reality by the actress playing Dani extra-ordinarily resonates with everyone's scary side of the mundane human condition.This high standard of mAstery sets up an expectation, that I thought is soon betrayed by even this most-promising writer-director going to sleep, soon after a strange repeat of Hereditary's deathly grief, worked-for distinctions of shock and art, and a perfectly extended-shot camera angle. It's going to be that story, again. At least MidNight ShyerAlien made a super-strong distinct second film, and an over-50% good third one in SiQns. Hell, even The Village at least kept reality in check, which this reminds you of in its consistent tedium where going nowhere downhill mostly happens. You know at the end he will pull all his fingers out. And when he does, it is too much the same too late. Plus the echo of his first film dulls the ceremonies inconsiderably.My expectations were too high. It changes the film. Damn me!
ACT IIBut the first offence is the worst.
When the first ceremony - deliciously drawn out with building weirdness it almost becomes another painting - does happen it could help rejoin and heal the high standard. But the consequence of the visitors staying is a huge flaw, and ruins the reality of the whole rest of the film. Plus why can't the method be gentle with a substance they later have many of to produce other effects?It seems Master Aster just could not think of a proper real way to get them to stay which is this: They needed to be forced, then the tension could begin. Because there is also no tension whatsoever. It violently throws down the situation it so highly built up.
The tripping visuals are a treat, but yet another missed development that could of added so much more. And because drugs could also become a way to get them to stay. The young group could be slowly brainwashed, and that sets up another level of growing terror as you watch them lose their minds. This is eventually done in bits and pieces, piecemeal as usual, giving the earned scattered reward.ACT IIIAs it becomes The Village II, even in the face of new murder the visitors just go along with it all until the last minute. What? And still stay. Watch The Green Inferno. That is how it is done.
Also unlike Hereditary the first bizarre way the climax ceremony is done has no explanation or meaning except to shock you. But it's so worth it, though another repetition.
Only at the end do the proceedings predictably start to gel properly as they get on track to a build up as you forget the past, and now blooms with finishing promise, and did that right. The very last shot finally equaling the first.Later when my expectations normalized I liked the film more and it's original horror vision.","

Midsommar," Not quite slow burn, psychological horror.
",just_in_case,18-Nov-19,"I would call this less horror and more horrifying. I definitely went in expecting some low level of torture porn, but hereditary was so gripping that I eventually caved and watched it. Very surprising. It reminded me, at least in tone, of the more morbid horror films in which at a certain point things start becoming so bleak that you're less expecting surprise and more preparing for an emotional drain. Its a bit like Bone tomahawk, cell block 99, The void or The Descent. You realize bad things are going to happen and the likelyhood of our protagonists coming out ok is looking grim. Its also at this point in the film that perception starts warping in a way that will make some people sick to their stomach. There's drugs involved, lots of drugs. The movie is in no way gory, but it is disturbing and difficult to watch. Its good, if you're looking for a serious drama, run away if you wanted popcorn flinging torture porn.I give it an 8. I could totally understand some people giving it a 7 or a 9 or 10. Theres a point in the film where literally nothing is technically happening, but I could not seem to pull myself away for a coke or a break. I was stuck to my seat. I think that deserves an 8. To me, while the protagonist Florence Pugh hit it out of the park and was mesmerizing to the point of a Bjork music video level, The other characters youre watching go through this arent given enough to do. After reading up on it I wish Id watched the directors cut. Definitely would recommend it over the theatrical release.","

Midsommar," Folk Horror At It's Best
",Pairic,10-Jul-19,"Midsommar: The Paganism in this film is very much of a Shamanistic type, differing in many aspects from the Celtic varieties. The ingestion of magic mushrooms is central to the rituals portrayed in the film and how the mushroom tea is filtered is made clear in a banner panel. A ""May Queen"" is chosen at the Midsommar, the winner of a dance around a pole, you dance until there is one woman left standing. In the old days The Dark One forced the young to dance till they died, now the young women dance in defiance of Him. These practises are carried out by a Cult in Northern Sweden at Midsommar when the Sun never sets.The contrast between the dark and snow of the U.S, as the film opens and the eternal sunshine of Sweden is vividly conveyed. Another darkness clouds Dani's (Florence Pugh) life as her sister kills their parents and commits suicide. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) wants to break up with Dani and is encouraged to do so by his friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Harper) but Christian feels a responsibility towards her. When classmate Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites Mark, Christian and Josh to join him at a midsummer celebration that occurs once every ninety years at his family commune, the Hårga, in Hälsingland, Christian cannot exclude Dani from the trip. When they arrive, they are all welcomed as if they family themselves. But there are warning signals which should have screamed ""Get Out Of Here"" to them, especially to Christian and Josh who are Anthropology postgrads.The Midsommar Ritual begins placidly enough but soon takes on an aura of strangeness. By the time the first scenes of violence occur they are perhaps not so shocking because of the developing eerie mood but they are quite gory. There are episodes of savagery and sadism throughout the second part of Midsommar but they are all related to The Ritual. Far more import to the the narrative's development is the uncanny feeling which permeates the entire the film. What happens to the characters after they arrive at the commune is perhaps preordained, every action they take is in some way related to The Ritual, In this manner, ritual development, Midsommar resembles Kill List and The Wickerman though the storylines and outcomes differ.Midsommar is not a film you will easily forget, several viewings may be necessary though for you to catch every fine detail. Director and writer Ari Aster has delivered another Folk Horror masterpiece. 9/10.

Midsommar," MIDSOMMAR MURDERS ReVisits THE VILLAGE That Sacrifices Reality
",superman1,16-Mar-21,"ACT IAri Master starts sharp as a knife glinting on characters' faces. The depth and expression underlying reality by the actress playing Dani extra-ordinarily resonates with everyone's scary side of the mundane human condition.This high standard of mAstery sets up an expectation, that I thought is soon betrayed by even this most-promising writer-director going to sleep, soon after a strange repeat of Hereditary's deathly grief, worked-for distinctions of shock and art, and a perfectly extended-shot camera angle. It's going to be that story, again. At least MidNight ShyerAlien made a super-strong distinct second film, and an over-50% good third one in SiQns. Hell, even The Village at least kept reality in check, which this reminds you of in its consistent tedium where going nowhere downhill mostly happens. You know at the end he will pull all his fingers out. And when he does, it is too much the same too late. Plus the echo of his first film dulls the ceremonies inconsiderably.My expectations were too high. It changes the film. Damn me!
ACT IIBut the first offence is the worst.
When the first ceremony - deliciously drawn out with building weirdness it almost becomes another painting - does happen it could help rejoin and heal the high standard. But the consequence of the visitors staying is a huge flaw, and ruins the reality of the whole rest of the film. Plus why can't the method be gentle with a substance they later have many of to produce other effects?It seems Master Aster just could not think of a proper real way to get them to stay which is this: They needed to be forced, then the tension could begin. Because there is also no tension whatsoever. It violently throws down the situation it so highly built up.
The tripping visuals are a treat, but yet another missed development that could of added so much more. And because drugs could also become a way to get them to stay. The young group could be slowly brainwashed, and that sets up another level of growing terror as you watch them lose their minds. This is eventually done in bits and pieces, piecemeal as usual, giving the earned scattered reward.ACT IIIAs it becomes The Village II, even in the face of new murder the visitors just go along with it all until the last minute. What? And still stay. Watch The Green Inferno. That is how it is done.
Also unlike Hereditary the first bizarre way the climax ceremony is done has no explanation or meaning except to shock you. But it's so worth it, though another repetition.
Only at the end do the proceedings predictably start to gel properly as they get on track to a build up as you forget the past, and now blooms with finishing promise, and did that right. The very last shot finally equaling the first.Later when my expectations normalized I liked the film more and it's original horror vision.","

Midsommar," Not quite slow burn, psychological horror.
",just_in_case,18-Nov-19,"I would call this less horror and more horrifying. I definitely went in expecting some low level of torture porn, but hereditary was so gripping that I eventually caved and watched it. Very surprising. It reminded me, at least in tone, of the more morbid horror films in which at a certain point things start becoming so bleak that you're less expecting surprise and more preparing for an emotional drain. Its a bit like Bone tomahawk, cell block 99, The void or The Descent. You realize bad things are going to happen and the likelyhood of our protagonists coming out ok is looking grim. Its also at this point in the film that perception starts warping in a way that will make some people sick to their stomach. There's drugs involved, lots of drugs. The movie is in no way gory, but it is disturbing and difficult to watch. Its good, if you're looking for a serious drama, run away if you wanted popcorn flinging torture porn.I give it an 8. I could totally understand some people giving it a 7 or a 9 or 10. Theres a point in the film where literally nothing is technically happening, but I could not seem to pull myself away for a coke or a break. I was stuck to my seat. I think that deserves an 8. To me, while the protagonist Florence Pugh hit it out of the park and was mesmerizing to the point of a Bjork music video level, The other characters youre watching go through this arent given enough to do. After reading up on it I wish Id watched the directors cut. Definitely would recommend it over the theatrical release.","

Midsommar," Folk Horror At It's Best
",Pairic,10-Jul-19,"Midsommar: The Paganism in this film is very much of a Shamanistic type, differing in many aspects from the Celtic varieties. The ingestion of magic mushrooms is central to the rituals portrayed in the film and how the mushroom tea is filtered is made clear in a banner panel. A ""May Queen"" is chosen at the Midsommar, the winner of a dance around a pole, you dance until there is one woman left standing. In the old days The Dark One forced the young to dance till they died, now the young women dance in defiance of Him. These practises are carried out by a Cult in Northern Sweden at Midsommar when the Sun never sets.The contrast between the dark and snow of the U.S, as the film opens and the eternal sunshine of Sweden is vividly conveyed. Another darkness clouds Dani's (Florence Pugh) life as her sister kills their parents and commits suicide. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) wants to break up with Dani and is encouraged to do so by his friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Harper) but Christian feels a responsibility towards her. When classmate Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites Mark, Christian and Josh to join him at a midsummer celebration that occurs once every ninety years at his family commune, the Hårga, in Hälsingland, Christian cannot exclude Dani from the trip. When they arrive, they are all welcomed as if they family themselves. But there are warning signals which should have screamed ""Get Out Of Here"" to them, especially to Christian and Josh who are Anthropology postgrads.The Midsommar Ritual begins placidly enough but soon takes on an aura of strangeness. By the time the first scenes of violence occur they are perhaps not so shocking because of the developing eerie mood but they are quite gory. There are episodes of savagery and sadism throughout the second part of Midsommar but they are all related to The Ritual. Far more import to the the narrative's development is the uncanny feeling which permeates the entire the film. What happens to the characters after they arrive at the commune is perhaps preordained, every action they take is in some way related to The Ritual, In this manner, ritual development, Midsommar resembles Kill List and The Wickerman though the storylines and outcomes differ.Midsommar is not a film you will easily forget, several viewings may be necessary though for you to catch every fine detail. Director and writer Ari Aster has delivered another Folk Horror masterpiece. 9/10.

",questl-18592,22-Oct-19,"I'm starting to think I'm just not on this director's wavelength. I hated Hereditary. I've been vehemently warned against the VVitch and as far as I'm concerned, Midsommar is terrible.This movie makes NO sense. Maybe I'm just missing it. Maybe it's all metaphor that I'm not connecting with. Maybe if I could understand all the un-subtitled Swedish I'd understand more. But, any movie I have to do research on just to understand it has failed on a fundamental level to convey its story in the allotted time.Beyond all that, the performances are awful. I didn't buy into any of the characters or the emotional journeys they went on. Florence Pugh is trying to give some emotion and at times full on heartbreak but all she really manages is a lot of ugly crying. Jack Reynor, the love interest, is as stiff as a board with all the personality of cardboard. He's supposed to be with this group for a reason but that barely even comes up until 2/3rds of the way through the movie, like they suddenly remembered, ""Oh yeah, he's supposed to have a story too.""The movie just made me mad. It's 148 minutes of boredom and agony. It's pretty sometimes. That's about the only positive to me.Steer clear.","

Midsommar," Unsettling Premise, but Stops Being Interesting After 30 Minute Mark
",ThomasDrufke,01-Aug-19,"The one thing I always come back to when thinking about both of Ari Aster's last few movies (Hereditary and Midsommar) is that I'm thrilled we still have filmmakers like him that bring a unique vibe to Hollywood films. Sometimes divisiveness can be bad and toxic, but in most cases, intelligent conversations are what makes this medium of art so special. And make no mistake, Midsommar is a piece of art. How much did I enjoy that piece of art? Well, that's a different answer. Slowly paced and seemingly forgetting the premise the first 15 minutes sets up, Midsommar finds itself stuck in a cult horror where most of the horror is off screen, as is anything interesting. Though admittedly, Florence Pugh turns in another fantastic turn as the lead.5.0/10","

Midsommar," When will people understand there is no such genre as ''Psychological Horror'' ?
",ShuhratGlazkov,28-Aug-19,"Hello thereI see that Midsommar depends on psychological horror aspect heavily as a horror movie but the thing is we got a problem here. Psychological horror can not be the main theme of a movie and can only and only be a side aspect of the movie make it better. Just like the ''Red Room'' scene from ''Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark'' or maybe ''Spahn Movie Ranch'' scene from ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood''. Psychological horror works with these 2 titles because in Scary Stories everything is just clear, you know there is something wrong and you know how that scene will end but you keep watching, it frightens you slowly and slowly. And in OUATIH, the movie itself is far from what you'd call a psychological horror but Spahn Movie Ranch scene is a standalone scene that's main focus is psychological horror that is thrown to the middle of a movie and when everything was going fine you just get that scene and it does what it is supposed to do and frightens you very well. But in such movies like ''Midsommar'', aka in movies which has psychological horror as its theme, it just doesn't work because you know that there is something wrong there. Let me give you a metaphorical example to understand it better. Think it like you are in the universe of ''Cabin in the Woods'' and participating in the events as a spectator. There is a one sided mirror between you and the victims. You just watch ''scientists'' release the monsters upon the victims and they die. They were the ones who did not know that something wrong was going to happen. And in a real movie it works exactly the same; You are the audience and you know there are some stuff that is wrong but the characters in the movie don't.
And when there are some stuff wrong you just prepare yourself as the audience. Unless the movie is very successful about making you feel for the characters and have some empathy for them you won't really have any psychological anxiety when something happens in the movie because you were waiting for that anyway. You knew that there were some wrong stuff happening around everywhere in the whole movie before that point so you were prepared for it. How is that supposed to give you psychological anxiety or whatever it is? Also this movie is way too long and which makes it predictable because you will have time to predict every possible outcome and then pick the one that makes the most sense (which is not very hard to choose tbh). Pretty sure they thought if they make the movie overly long and slow it would help to create that ''psychological horror and anxiety'' world they wanted to build for the movie but no luck, not this time.EDIT: Forgot the sex scenes of the movie. Lmao what was that cmon.. I really don't know what director was thinking when he decided to do that. Everyone in my saloon was basically laughing hysterically at those scenes. They absolutely did not stand for anything else but just some great chuckles. Gotta give it to it tho, was the best chuckle I had in a movie this year. I don't accept psychological horror as the main theme of a movie so this movie belongs to no genre at all. There is no mystery in the movie because movie is way too easy to predict thanks to its runtime. There is no other horror elements other than some heavy gore in 2 scenes and some ''psychological'' horror elements so it is not a horror movie as well. I don't even know what this movie is... But damn sure it is something overy long, predictable and slow.","

Midsommar," Perhaps The Strangest Movie Of 2019
",zkonedog,03-Feb-20,"When the credits rolled on my ""Midsommar"" watching experience, my first thought was ""that was the strangest movie I've seen in quite some time"". I probably should not have been surprised, seeing as how this was director Ari Aster's next project after the equally quirky ""Hereditary"". While I can't go so far as to say that the strangeness of ""Midsommar"" made it one of my favorite films, I did--aside from one fatal flaw--enjoy the overall experience.For a very basic overview, ""Midsommar"" sees young adult Dani (Florence Pugh) going through a hard time. Her entire family is destroyed by an incredibly traumatic event, and to top things off boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is waffling within the relationship. Somewhat reluctantly, Christian and his fellow dissertation-searching friends invite Dani on their trip to Sweden to study Midsommar festivals. What they all find is an experience unlike anything that has ever been witnessed.The setup in this film is generally very solid. The whole process sort of reminds me of films like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", where the filmmakers do a great job of creating authentic characters while surrounding them with an air of mystery. In the journey to the actual festival, all the characters here seem like they could be playing out a very believable scenario, and that makes them ultra-relatable.Once at the crazy Swedish festival, the film is sort of a combination of ""The Village"" and ""The Wicker Man"". While the proceedings start off as fairly innocuous, the bizarreness of the whole thing slowly unveils itself. Very well-paced in terms of not getting too crazy too fast, while also getting in enough scares/thrills to satisfy the audience.A lot of praise so far, so why the seven-star rating? Because ""Midsommar"" suffers from one fatal flaw:(Warning: Heavy spoilers ahead!)This is very much a metaphor film. If taken literally, the events make very little sense. Only after looking at it from a certain lens do the pieces begin to fall into place. Essentially, the entire movie is Dani's grief experience of losing her family and then not being supported by her boyfriend. In order for that to ""work"", though, the film needed to make it more clear that Christian was indeed a dead-beat, lame partner. In all honesty, the down-to-earth quality of the character writing might have actually hurt the film in this regard, as I never got the sense that Christian was an out-and-out villain. As the film itself expressly states, ""maybe Dani is being too clingy/needy?"". While surely not ultra-supportive, I just never got that sense that Christian was the ""big bad"" here, and without that the overall metaphor (especially the ending) falls a bit flat.Overall, though, ""Midsommar"" fascinated me enough for me to give it solid marks. The major misstep described above prevented me personally from totally buying in, but I can easily see others not having that problem (provided they recognize it for the metaphor journey that it is, of course).","

The cinematography is also good. My only criticism with it is that most of the scenes in Sweden or overexposed due to all the White Wardrobe. From my experience when shooting white, So much white, Pure White, needs to be taken to a to a pale beige as to not absorb everyone surrounding it. Also, all the flowers used was unrealistic being there was never a flower growing anywhere in sight. Where did they come from.They were clearly artificial for the films purpose for the many takes and set-ups. But that is only Due to having been in the film industry for 40 years. The average Pedestrian audience member would not be concerned over this. In short It is fantastic film making and not for your normal Horror Fan. It is so much better than those sort of blood and guts fanatics. Also for the people saying the film is slow, It is meant to be slow, most religious ceremonies and rituals are slow ,","

",bluepineboy,28-Sep-20,"I couldn't bring myself to give it higher than a 3. Which is a real shame! It so much going for it. It started off strong with solid acting, beautiful cinematography, great mood with sound and lighting. I was all in. And then it kept going... and going... and going... and about half way through I was like, what the hell am I watching. And then it just fell off a cliff. The second half of this film made no sense. Defied any logic. And was just dumb. I was literally angry at the end. To the point that it ruined the entire movie for me.","

",unyan,17-Jul-19,Like a strange mix of Get Out and the Wicker man. I found myself yawning throughout most of this sadly as it really is around 45 minutes too long. It's a familiar premise which if youve watched any supernatural horror films before won't spring any surprises on you. I was looking forward to it having really enjoyed Heredity which was not formulaic as this one is but as always you shouldn't believe the hype til youve witnessed with your own eyes.,"

Midsommar," Scandi Wicker
",kevin c,26-Jan-20,"Not really a horror film, more a disturbing, psychological insight into grief. Midsommar is the first pagan break-up movie, which has a major nod to The Wicker Man.This film has brutal violence, the deaths are shocking and gruesome. And the orgies are a little awkward. But it isn't a horror film. This is about what happens when you drop a fragile relationship into the most extreme of circumstances.Florence Pugh is fantastic - fact. She is always fantastic - fact. One memorable scene where she collapses on to the floor under the weight of her own anguish, wailing like an animal. But Reynor is also decent, reacting to everything like a deer in headlights. His coping mechanism is to straight out refuse to process anything that's happening to him.The film, which stretches to nearly three hours, is in no rush to reach its horrifying conclusion. It never dragged and you feel like one of the characters, uncertain about the impending situation. This is strange and distressing stuff, punishing at times. But a film filled with ideas, images, and feelings that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.","

Midsommar," Depends on your ability to suspend disbelief
",richanderson-99667,20-Oct-20,"I watched this movie last night. Its production values and story line were sufficiently excellent to make me watch to the end...I often give up on inferior movies. I was attracted to see it after seeing Florence Pugh in Lady Macbeth (Which I have viewed twice). This was an altogether different role and I felt that she was diminished by it: too often, she came across as a a spoilt brat who, when things weren't going her way, looked like someone had stolen her chocolates, i.e. no real fury or force of character.As I said, the production was really excellent. The cinematography was natural and didn't draw attention to itself, yet was revealing of the unfolding story. The sets, costumes and script drew you in.But ultimately, your reaction to this movie on your ability to suspend disbelief. SPOILER ALERT: can you believe that sophisticated Swedes can behave like depraved cannibals. If yes, this is an 8+ movie. If no, it's a 2-3. For me, it's the latter.","

",vahidrak,12-Dec-19,"I spent one hour in youtube after watching this movie and it was so beautiful, there is so much information about this movie that every channel was implying something new. well except for Ari Aster saying that ""this is a break up movie""
First of all, this is not a horror movie. Why people watching it expect horror? it wasn't even written in the movie's genre. If you watch it and expect a horror movie it's going to be a very long and boring one. so just watch it as a thriller drama.
Second of all, I think the development of characters was one of the strongest points about it, Dani is a girl with no family and then in the village she eventually finds one, her boyfriend, Christian, is a senseless not-caring boyfriend who pretends to care about his 3/4 year relationship and he also ends up with the consequences of his decisions. it was perfect

Midsommar," Hum, where is the horror?
",m-47826,13-Aug-20,"All I saw was an extended drama, with unlikeable and annoying characters, and cheesy gore. Ending in a predictable way. And really, after that stupid « paper excuse ». Who would root for any of them to survive? It's not a bad movie, it's just not good at being what it think it is. Horror. There is zero tension, in fact it is pretty made up, and artificial mood setting. The director looks too pleased with himself, for his « experience » to be genuinely appreciated. Like I said, the horrific aspect is non-existent, among all those cheap manipulations. That only work on people who've never seen a genre movie before. It even made some of the « shocking » scenes look stupid. The main actress is good. But her character is a mess, and you don't expect or wish any sort of happy ending, to that shell of herself, she becomes near the end of the movie. Ending that I didn't find particularly disturbing nor hard to grasp. But maybe it's just my too jaded self talking. Good drama, bad horror. I see it more as a psychological thriller, but mostly because of what happens to the heroine, who is by far the most relatable and less stereotypical character. The dark humor is pretty effective, but it clearly isn't what the movie was aiming for. Check for yourself, but don't expect anything special either. It's pure survivor movie that don't really understand how the horror genre works. Dare I say, overrated?...","

Midsommar," Pretty, summer, no fun
",justinwfirestone,09-Jul-19,"Whoo-ahh! There sure is an awful lot to unpack here, and I mean awful, a lot. Ari Aster is continuing to provide evidence that he is the unholy offspring of Eli Roth and Lars von Trier, but only if they were brothers, because incest can produce people who are ""open"" to oracular visions.Is Midsommar a dark comedy about emotionally abusive relationships and how awful dudes can be when they get together on vacation? It's neither dark nor funny enough for that qualification, and about an hour longer than would necessary to develop such credentials. Beyond that, the movie vacillates between gore-shock, pretty visuals, and far-fetched rituals which literally, and figuratively, beat the dead to death like Gallagher smashing watermelons on a beautiful summer day.I suppose Midsommar might trip your trigger some if you, for example, had never been on the Internet and had never clicked on stuff you wish you hadn't. Or maybe you would find it refreshing if you had never seen the original Wicker Man with Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. The ultimate parallel could be Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, depicting visitors as they explore a wondrous, yet perilous, new world.There has to be a better way to break up than Midsommar suggests, but there are also an awful lot of movies to watch instead.","

Midsommar," There is a point when a movie just gets too weird and silly.
",gargantuaboy,28-Apr-20,"This movie does for Sweden what ""Midnight Express"" did for Turkey. Dani and her boyfriend decide to go spend the summer in Sweden for some special event. Their friend Pelle has friends there that are also taking place in this special tradition that only happens every nine years so everybody is excited to go. Dani has recently lost her parents and sister in a family tragedy so this will be a nice escape for her.Everything seems wonderful when they get there, everybody lives in green grassy mountains and fields and do nothing but sing and bake little pies and make tea. Everybody that lives in this odd community looks like something is just a little off. All of the people they meet seem to have nothing going on aside from singing and participating in rituals. They make the Manson family look like The Waltons.In one VERY graphic scene we see how these people do away with the elderly. Instead of sending them off to die slowly in nursing homes they are taken to a very high mountain where they just jump to their deaths. Believe me if blood turns you off this is not the movie for you. This is an extremely disturbing sequence and director Ari Aster really lets you see more than you might want to.What is particularly odd is that really only two minor characters complain about that death scene and they want to leave. Dani is played by Florence Pugh and she does exactly what she do with this part. She is extremely believable. The problem with the movie is everybody is just way too creepy and when people start dying and things just get weirder I just kind of fast forwarded the last 20 minutes or so. There is just a point where the movie gets too weird and quite frankly RIDICULOUS. Check it out but beware, it's oddly disturbing and not in a fun Texas Chainsaw kind of way.","

The story was not a masterpiece, but was pretty well done.Trying to think of where there may be room for criticism. The horror was extremely over the top. Maybe a little bit of subtlety now and then could have actually made it more powerful. I can understand how many Swedes purportedly liked it as a black comedy rather than a horror film.

Midsommar," A Midsommar Night's Dream...or Nightmare
",lavatch,07-Nov-19,"This reviewer gave Ari Aster's film ""Hereditary"" the rating of 5, and ""Midsommar"" merits the same mark for the same reasons. In the bonus track of the DVD of ""Midsommar,"" Aster describes his goals of wanting to leave audiences ""moved, unsettled, and confused"" through the experience of ""an adult fairy tale."" But he could have achieved those goals without the long, protracted build-ups to the ritualistic scenes at the heart of the experience.Ostensibly set in Sweden but filmed in Hungary, ""Midsommar"" makes use of a large, open field that was converted into the village in which an ancient Scandinavian cult practices its rites unimpeded by the constraints of modern civilization. The action unfolds primarily through the perspective of Dani Ardor, a young woman who has experienced the traumatic loss of family members. She then travels with her boyfriend Christian to Sweden where they will partake of summer ""festivities"" built around the June solstice and the customs of the Harga in the small village. But after they arrive and participate along with the cult, it would appear that Dani is being thrown from the frying pan into the fire.In the extras segment of the DVD, writer-director Aster observed that he wrote the screenplay for ""Midsommar"" in response to a personal crisis in his life after a painful break-up. But the self-indulgence of the film went too far in stringing out the mundane activities of the village and an arty approach to the horror genre. In the interviews of cast and crew, it was apparent that the film personnel admired the auteur style of Aster. But the cast seemed to bristle at the limitations they felt from not having greater artistic license of their own in this meticulously choreographed pageant. Everyone seemed to move out of the way for Aster to take charge so that he could exorcise his personal demons.The reactions of Dani to the bizarre conditions of her new environment seemed ambivalent at best. She never seemed to take a liking to the cult experience until the very end, when her reactions seemed forced and not believable. An alternative and more realistic portrayal of Dani would have been closer to Dorothy in the land of Oz, trying her best to remind herself that ""there's no place like home."" Instead, the little May Queen gleefully accepts a pagan dormitory as her new home, yet needs sleeping pills at night. As she admires her handiwork in the violent ritual practices of old, she had to realized like Dorothy that it was a long way to come from Kansas for that cathartic experience and that it now may not be easy to get back home.","

Midsommar," Like watching a wounded animal's very gradual demise followed by it's decomposition into nothingness.
",thesmythley,29-Mar-20,"I admit, I went in withfairly high expectations here. I had thought that the film would be less a horror and more based on an analysis of the psychology of being in a cult. The film while initially intriguing becomes abruptly, about halfway through, very painful to watch, probably to compensate for it's lack of substance. If you are intrigued by Midsommar because you're expecting it to be like the Wickerman (original film) you'll be disappointed. The characters are very passive. They are irritatingly idiotic and there are no redeeming features about any of them by the time the film is reaches it's paaaaainfully slooooow conclusion. Believe me, it is painful.The truly bizarre aspect about Midsommar, is that initially the film carries a sense of impending morbid sort of dread, which is very effective.However, the writer/director seems to, later on in the story, drive this morbid dread into overkill, as if to deliberately outrage the audience in an attempt to rival other films that carry a similar genre? Who knows. But this is what ruins the film.It comes across as unnecessary because you are just watching what I have already described in the review's title. It's as if the diretor/writer made it their personal drive to make the film so unbearable in the hopes of outraging the audience. However, it is this drive that ultimately paints Midsommar as a film that is trying to comes across as something more than it is. Unfortunately it is ultimately nothing more than a standard format of a horror film hiding in the clothes of something profound sounding and feeling.","

Midsommar," A white hot piece of crap
",chrischanwasframed,05-Aug-22,"This film is complete garbage. Do not believe any of the hype. It has only two things I like. The main girl seems like a nice enough character and so I did want her to be okay and that is good for a film to have at least one likeable character. I hated every other character or was completely indifferent to them, so that is not good. The best thing about it is some of the visuals. It has some very nice sights of the European countryside. It looked like a nice place to be. They also wear some good costumes (for this sort of movie) but everything else was just horrible. I thought it was creepy but not in a good way. The Exorcist is very disturbing but I am alright with all of that stuff because it all serves the story, the exorcist is about light vs dark, good vs evil, so when she does xyz stuff it is horrifying, but it works because you know it is because she is possessed by a demon and you want the priests to be able to defeat it and get rid of it so she can be a nice normal girl again. In this, there isn't really much of a point to the disgusting gory stuff, other than to be disgusting and gory just for the sake of it to shock you. So the film is quite well made in terms of visuals and soundtrack etc, the acting is fine given what they had to work with, the premise even had potential (a creepy Swedish cult are not as friendly as they seem cue bloody horror stuff) but I just did not like the overall story, or pretty much any of the characters. That is another thing, I think it is a shame, because with better writing and characters this could have been a pretty cool horror movie, but it just didn't live up to its potential. It is all style over substance. This is one white Swedish death cult I will not be joining. Better luck next time you creepy ABBA murderers.","

Midsommar," Ambitious but Overlong
",sportsnut-66935,04-Jul-19,"First off, anyone who planned to see this movie
should go in with an open mind. It's a movie going experience that is very difficult to describe. Ari Aster film delivers on being very disturbing and gruesome but suffers from major pacing issues.The good: the cinematography, acting, colors and music are nearly flawless. It is one of the most technically stunning films you will see. The music makes the film all the more unsettling at times and the camera shots can linger for so long it begins to make you nervous. The acting is solid specifically from Pugh. Will Poulter is funny at times and intentionally annoying as almost all his characters are. If you were expecting hereditary part 2, you may want to reconsider.While this film just gets crazier and crazier as it goes, it can be hard to forget that this story is Dani's and that's where you will find what this movie is truly about. It's about an unstable relationship that decays and eventually explodes and forces a new cycle of self-discovery. You will probably need to read articles or watch videos on this movie when you come out like I did.Now on to the issues. This movie is long. And I enjoy long movies. Hereditary was perfectly paced but there are numerous scenes in this movie that could be trimmed down or cut. People will say it adds to the movie as a whole but some don't. Also, there are supposed to be some genuinely unsettling scenes but almost everyone in the theater burst out laughing. Nudity can be a hard thing to take seriously when it's showed like this, but I understand that some pagan rituals actually do that, so i understand where it's coming from. While the climax is far from as unforgettable as hereditary, the story does come full circle and will leave you with an unsettling final shot.Overall, Aster's sophomore film doesn't reach the heights of hereditary, but still provides much of what people loved about that movie. You will most likely walk out of the theater thinking wtf did I just watch, but that's the point. It's a film that requires multiple viewings and some research to truly appreciate. Go see it to form your own opinion though because this could end up being more divisive than hereditary.","

Midsommar," A Mild Case of Midsommar Madness
",tigerfish50,09-Nov-19,"Cinema audiences' admiring response to 'Midsommar' is the most mysterious aspect of this ho-hum 'horror' film which shamelessly copycats ""The Wicker Man"". The story begins with the murder-suicide of a female college student's parents and sister - and after this tragedy a fellow student invites her to visit the religious community in Sweden where he'd been raised.Accompanied by her semi-estranged boyfriend and a couple of disposable pals, the visitors arrive at their destination and the narrative immediately goes downhill. Instead of growing tension and menace at the remote hamlet, the creepy cultists offer long-winded rituals, tedious chanting and absurd occult beliefs. The witless students never develop into sympathetic characters, nor the peasant-costumed pagans into truly sinister villains. As a result, when bad things start happening, it's impossible to care about any of the rustic weirdness or the ultimate fate of the fall-guys.","

Midsommar," Ari Aster is set for legendary status
",branflakes4547,07-Jul-19,Aside from the main actor (Jack Raynor?) Being pretty awful the entire movie is exceptional. It starts off ominous and then slaps you in the face 20 minutes in. And that feeling of dread never leaves your soul as you slowly descend into the best nightmare you will ever have. It needs to be said that it is not as good as 2018's Hereditary but it is still a movie that needs to be seen. Very pleased with what A24 is putting out the past few years.,"

Midsommar," Impeccable art direction, but problematic script
",eagandersongil,29-Sep-19,"""Midssomar"" brings with it an incredible look, constant tension and discomfort, and great technicalities, but it misses a lot in its script, promising young Ari Aster's second film is below its first feature but adds a fuller cinematic experience.The film presents a problem, its script, which does not know where to focus or even what to tell, with a course of the lost plot, not knowing where to walk and poor plot and rhythm choices, a completely unnecessary first act that could have solved in 5 minutes, leaving for the ""main plot"", although this does not seem to exist here, a attention deficit counted on not knowing where to focus and diverse are the characters without narrative function, not to mention the various arcs and cores that are open and never completed, this may even be purposeful and work in many movies, but it doesn't work here.If the script presents problems, technically the film is exquisite, with a contrast to the usual horror photography, very clear and beautiful, an amazing scenery composition and great costumes, the art direction deserves merit here, from the make-up. even the choreography is spectacular in many ways, even the sound mixing is great, just like the soundtrack that blends a modern and classic rhythm.Ari Aster has a meritorious direction, the director directs his film well, he knows how to create the mood and the tension well, with a camera that can be caustrophobic even with open angles and great cuts, dry and vicerais, besides the already commenting and wonderful scenery composition, but the script's attention deficit slips a little in the direction as well, as the director gets lost in his own created world and gets very excited with the camera in hand, there are many unnecessary contemplations and techniques that do not In keeping with the rest of the film, Ari had some great ideas for his second film, but he had a lot of execution problems, it is undeniable that the young director has talent, but his excitement in wanting to demonstrate this ends up damaging his film.The Cast is very good, although some characters have no narrative function, the actors play their roles, even Will Poulter as comic relief is fine, not to mention all the scary and great members of the Swedish village, but the big highlight really stands for Florence, the little-known British actress gives a show of her own and gives herself completely to her role, ranging from despair to drama, to fear and acceptance.Ari's second film has several merits, but it also has problems, mainly of execution and lack of clarity in its focus, sometimes in the direction, but mainly in the script, with an unnecessary first act and a script that cannot decide which story tell, but we have a dazzling art direction and a direction that, despite the detours, is extremely uncomfortable, often causing nuisance, which is good for a horror movie. The goal of being daunting in daylight works primarily at the beginning, once we get used to it it loses strength. ""Midssomar"" is being loved or hated, I think it's a good movie, nothing more than that, but if I had to choose between loving and hating, I'd rather love. It is also important for the viewer to embark on the long wave to feel its tension and despair, otherwise it will be a long, boring and tiring trip.

Midsommar," Very eerie and unsettling
",zaremskya-23761,16-Jun-23,"One of the more disturbing films shot in broad daylight, and probably done so intentionally for a jarring psychological effect.Really loved this film as a horror movie. It starts off with some rather disturbing stuff right away actually, with a graphic suicide and murder involving the protagonist's sister and parents. This immediately hints at the tone of the film to come.Stylistically, this film works like a lot of A24 productions and films shot in the 2000s - clear shots, bright scenes and careful camerawork, etc... Lots of intensity too.The plot is thus - after a traumatic suicide and murder, the protagonist is off to Sweden with her friends to visit a commune, the home of one of the characters, Pelle. Danis friends are students interested in the culture surrounding Pelle's commune, so the trip works out for everyone.The commune and its festivities and activities are rather picturesque/utopic upon arrival, and the students take some shrooms right away, resulting in a bad trip for Dani, with flashbacks to her sister's suicide.Now the students are fully engaged in the commune's activities, which turn out to be very disturbing for them. They witness a ritualistic senicide of the village elders and are horrified/disgusted, with some wanting to leave immediately. They do, supposedly. Though some still want to continue studying and writing about the commune.Now the film continues, and the commune's vibe continues to become stranger for the Americans and for the audience. Some students disappear, some are killed, and Dani becomes ""May Queen"" after winning a maypole dance concert, seemingly oblivious to the strange disappearances. All the while with a hallucinatory effect from special effects and food/drink imbibed by everyone. The ""trippy"" effect of camerawork is a nice touch that emphasizes the surrealness the Americans are encountering.Christian is entreated to participate in an elaborate mating ritual, which traumatizes Dani, despite Christian wanting to break up with her back in the states. The commune members are constantly ""mimicking"", in an almost mocking fashion, the pain and suffering that befalls the characters in this film.After the ritual, Christian attempts to flee, encountering the dead corpses of his American friends, then is paralyzed. He is now a human sacrifice, which turns out to be the plan all along for the commune. Dani, the May Queen, decides that Christian will now be sacrificed with some other commune members and the rest of the Americans in a bizarre ritual in involving a skinned bear. Again, the commune members mock the agony of the sacrificed, but Dani smiles at it all in the end.Stylistically, the film, again is like A24's other great works, and like many films in the 2000s - big, clear photography, careful camerawork, and sometimes with very intense sequences and images. The re-occurring hallucinogenic ""waves"" that appear frequently and distorted photography becomes a visual motif representing the surreal and confusing nature of this experience.This film, disturbing and fascinating to me, is most likely a comment on agrarian utopia, cultural rituals, communal living and what the costs of respecting and preserving such things are if there are elements involved that prove to be unethical. Human sacrifice and ritualistic suicide are not uncommon in human history and cultures, and indeed, the concept of Utopia, despite being ideal, is usually provided with a warning by scholars of what the means to that end will be, in regards to any violence carried out to achieve such an utopic society.This film very purposefully brings those issues front and center with a stylish horror touch. Horror seems like a perfect medium to explore some serious sociological issues, and the brilliance of this film is presenting such horrifying events and scenes in a world that is supposed to be ideal for all.Of course, ideal societies are possible and do work. I have friends who grew up on communes and were not sacrificed or burned alive, lol... You just have to be a little more connected to modern society and grounded in reality.I hope this film does not turn people off from seeking out ideal societies/communes/etc..., but it does provide a fair warning about cultish and sadistic behaviors/practices that are not ""un-checked"" by modern society.Great film. Loved it. Recommended.","

",namstonk,26-Sep-19,"Well the cinematography is stunning as is the direction, however the dialogue/script is totally vapid and in love with itself. The characters bore the hell out of you and no connection can be made too them. The biggest problem is its speed, there is none, the progression meanders, we all know what is coming but takes ages to arrive. In the end you are left wanting and regret the time spent, If it wasn't for the colours and cinematography it would only get a two star rating. Don't believe the high scores, it's just the usual folk who want to be seen as arty, you'll have it proven two and a bit hours in, just truly corny and laughable.

",revelinchaos,05-Nov-19,"I had read good things about it, and curiosity kept me going until the very end, but then it felt like I spent 165 minutes watching A Space Odyssey's monkeys crushing bones (minus the metaphor)...In other words: nicely shot, but hollow, and not scary or suspenseful in the least (since it was supposed to be horror movie, right?). Story and plot are basically non-existent, scares and thrills are simply not there, the pace is slow, characters are undeveloped mono-dimensional cardboard figures... As mentioned before, it's visually very good and imaginative, but that's not nearly enough.4/4.5 - A fail, IMHO.

",thetyvonlesure,05-Jul-19,"Midsommar is an incredibly wild ride that gives a new meaning to Cult Classic. This film is artsy in the sense that every camera shot in this film is masterful, by presenting another dynamic to the film. The plot is incredibly sinister and deceptive. While the film lacks in the same intrigue as Hereditary (Aster's previous film), it thrives in visual presentation and organized chaos. The acting is phenomenal, as each actor presents their character with a sense of suspense. The pacing is like watching a slow car wreck. From start to finish, this film is disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. Overall, Midsommar is a unique horror flick that leaves the viewer feeling like they've seen the birth of Satan himself.","

Midsommar," A pain in the Aster.
",domtaylor,09-Jul-19,"'Midsommar' starts out fairly well with an undeniably disturbing scene that acts as an interesting setup for both the characters and what would seem to be the underlying theme of the piece. Unfortunately, it steeply goes downhill once the characters arrive at the festival. Quite frankly, it soon becomes a bore; it's not scary, thrilling, tense, or even dramatic, and any semblance of theme or character is thrown out of the window. The complete lack of any dread, tension, or atmosphere leads you to wonder what the whole point of it is. It doesn't even feel like it's trying to be scary or unnerving at all, aside from the few moments of overt gore that are shown in great detail. This was clearly only done in a desperate attempt to shock the audience, which is kind of a cheap move. Aster even seems to think that foreign customs are enough to unnerve them. The whole piece really tries to evoke a fear of 'the other', which is really quite disrespectful. For example, there are several very long scenes showing the cult do traditional dances and chants, even simply eating meals in the way that they do. They aren't doing anything at all weird or scary here, yet it seems Aster just included them to build a sense of dread. He even includes a disabled character that has absolutely no purpose within the narrative; he only exists as an attempt to 'frighten' the audience. Again, this isn't scary, it's just disrespectful. Another issue is that the characters generally don't feel threatened or in danger at any point, which is really detrimental to the film. If they're not scared, why should we be? Of course, we don't really care about them anyway. In the end, 'Midsommar' is just an extremely overlong collection of uninteresting scenes about uninteresting characters, that has zero atmosphere, dread, or tension. It's not scary, which wouldn't even be so much of a problem if it had an engaging story and good characters, and you leave feeling absolutely nothing, wondering what the whole point of it is. I must say that it is extremely well made, with some interesting shots, great production design and fantastic performances, but when the story is this bad that doesn't really account for anything. It's a real shame, too, as this should be the cure to modern 'jump scare central' horror flicks that flood the screens every month. Aster clearly has the talent behind the camera to craft something unique in the genre, but here he's completely wasted that on an absolutely terrible story with no scares at all. It's just a waste of time really. 4/10","

Midsommar," Boring, pretentious dross for the critics to drool over
",areatw,19-Jan-20,"'Midsommar' is another example of why you should never trust the 'expert' verdict of movie critics. If you are part of the 99% of people that judges a film based on its entertainment value rather than as a piece of art, then don't waste your time on this pretentious rubbish. It isn't entertainment, just artsy garbage.'Midsommar' is two-an-a-half hours of absolutely nothing. It isn't scary or disturbing, in fact its attempt at being the latter are more likely to disgust than disturb - some of the scenes towards the end of the film are vomit-inducing. The storyline is boring, the characters uninteresting. The storyline is so thin it could have been told in two-and-a-half minutes rather than hours.The reason 'Midsommar' has gone down so well, particularly with the critics, is because it looks so good. It's stylish, artsy and, perhaps most importantly, foreign. I'm yet to find a film with the all of the above attributes that the critics haven't drooled over, no matter how bad I or the general audience thought they were.","

Midsommar," Beautiful film, and Pugh is a revelation
",gbill-74877,29-Jan-20,"Florence Pugh is tremendous from the very start, with that extraordinary first scene where she conveys so many emotions in her face while on the phone. It's a terrific performance and I can't wait to see more from her.I love how well Ari Aster writes/directs scenes with deep grief and emotions in both this film and Hereditary. The actors have to deliver of course and they do, but there is such honesty in the material and the amount of time he spends on it that it adds considerable depth to the horror that follows.This is also quite simply a gorgeous film. The colors, camera angles, ceremonies, nature scenery, those slightly off-kilter roofs on the buildings ... it's all so visually stunning. The soundtrack definitely keeps up with it too.It may go on a teeny bit too long especially since we see the gist of what's coming, but on the other hand, it allows for this culture to be rendered so completely in every disturbing little way, and I was engaged to the end.Quote:

This is the second film by Ari Aster I watched and it seems like he revels in his prowess of creating distastefully violent and gratuitous misery. IT DOES NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR!

Midsommar," Another masterpiece for Ari Aster
",jctundis,05-Jul-19,"Director Ari Aster said this was a film about dependency which he wrote during a breakup
... and it shows. But it's so much more.A commentary on religion, friendship, depression, identity -- all inside an extremely unsettling Swedish folklore, sex cult, horror story. And it's funny, too! Yes, all these ideas exist simultaneously in a brilliant and methodically paced film that frolics in the realm between all things Kubrick and the Wicker Man.There are layers upon layers, clues given, and a deliberately hypnotic and hallucinigenic sensibility that lolls the senses so that the more graphic scenes of graphic horror hit with jarring impact. Moreso, to me, than in Aster's previous film Heritary (the best film of 2018). Not for fans of quick cut commercial fare, the timid or the squeamish, Midsommar is a beautiful, horrifying meta-gestalt that I look forward to viewing again.","

Midsommar," A convenient way to see a bunch of cliches
",j_walking1516,14-Oct-19,"The cinema was nice but that was it. I'll try to phrase it nicely below but this movie was an absolute bore and a checklist of tropes and cliches
I remember when I saw the very first preview, the day it came out andd I said ""that looks like teen based Wicker Man""
Sitting at a lengthy 2.5 hours I was hoping for quite a deep dive of cult horror.
The cinematography was wonderful, great pans of landscapes and scenery. The location of filming was gorgeous and the frame work was excellent. All of it well directed as seems to be Ari Aster's forte
The lore is strangely shallow for it's length. What they had was interesting and convincing for the cult. The convictions and ideals were fun to hear about but ultimately could have been fleshed out more.
The acting was acceptable even tho all of the characters were unlikable and tremendously oblivious to any danger. Character creation seems to be a weakness for Ari. I do hope to see more of the female lead, Florence Pugh, in more roles in the future. She did great in her part but was restricted by the character.
Overall, this was everything I expected it to be to a T. It's not that it was a bad movie it was just the exact formula that you would expect from the preview. And as I thought, it was essentially teen based Wicker Man. I feel like I've seen this movie before and nothing super new was brought to the table.
It also could have been very easily 30-40 minutes shorter.
I did enjoy it far more than Hereditary. I can see why people got excited about it and I hope Ari keeps pushing out big hitters to help the genre out. Both his movies brought a ton of attention to the horror world and that's great! but I think I'll pass on his future movies.","

Midsommar," Horryfing and uncomfortable
",marceldinardi,12-Feb-20,"Saw this with a girl a couple of weeks ago. And as you might think this was not the perfect movie for the occasion. That being said, this was an excellent well thought out film with Oscar-worthy acting by Florence Pugh. Not only was the acting on point, but the cinematography in this film was so important. It kept the horrendous mood of the film tamed with beautifully shot scenes to the very end.Horrifying and uncomfortable to the last second, a must watch!","

Midsommar," A horror feel good movie about belonging
",richardmolenschot,27-Feb-20,"First of all: if a movie receives very low and very high scores then you know an art-film or new classic is born. And despite the sometimes gory shots, as a horror movie it actually doesn't really fit in the genre. Which is refreshing.The movie delivers in the acting, as has been said many times before. And it is a psychedelic trip on one level. On the other hand, this movie is all about belonging somewhere. Having an environment that is caring and loving and healthy.And that's what's so good about this movie to me. If your environment is toxic, uncaring and unhealthy, like Dani's is, it is actually a lot better to be included in a society that has it's brutal rituals but definitely is loving and caring. At the end of this movie i was rooting for the Swedish commune instead of Dani's friends.What did help in this proces was the fact that the horror scene's weren't really scary, and, as a critical note, the special effects / grime wasn't that convincing and sometimes a bit laughable. If the effects we're of a higher level, i think i would've been more conflicted in the end.Nevertheless, if you love cinema or theatre, and liked to be inspired by an out-of-the-box kinda movie, I'd definitely recommend Midsommar.","

Midsommar," Brightly lit, underplayed, slow burn horror
",Hallelujah289,07-Feb-20,"This is the first film I watched by this director. Having no expectations, and not having watched his previous debut film Hereditary, I was impressed with the skillful storytelling, the way the shots were staged, and the use of various cutaways and CGI effects to show the characters's states of trauma and drug induced disorientation. The cinematography and use of color is amazing, I believe filmed in Hungary but set in Sweden. The overexposure does lend itself to a feeling of being off kilter, as well as the smiling good humor of the Swedish commune, as they distribute unknown drugs and perform terrible and disturbing rituals. All of this is very numbing and a good kind of commentary to the tolerated unease in the relationship of the principal characters Dani and Christian, who are on the brink of break up.The director has said the film Midsommar was a way of his trying to navigate the feelings of his break up. He has said there is no specific correlation but that he most identifies with Dani and that he has a lingering attachment to ""dead things,"" perhaps meaning to dead relationships. He offers no further specifics, but watching the film you get a sense of how, perhaps, those in our collective ancestral past dealt with cycles of life and death, be it by ritual or sacrifice (extremely literal in this movie), and the kind of depth of emotion that goes with those ceremonies of beginnings and ends.Midsommar is one part neurotic, hyper articulate and hyper aware relationship drama, portrayed very relatably, and then one part drugged out, mythical, pagan sunshine nightmare. It at times feels it's budget with some of its editing choices and choice of cast (familiar faces who don't quit gel together), but at other times it has the look and sound of incredible filmmaking, if very sparse in the absence of more sounds, and the gore it sometimes does show exorbitantly and then other times not at all.Horror isn't my genre, but I admire this film for its originality and the type of catharsis it does begin to induce. I don't think it went quite all the way for me in this department. I was expecting more. This film probably needs a very specific audience. Please do appreciate it for its staging and cinematography in any case.","

Midsommar," This Film Doesn't Have ONE original Bone In Its Body.
",redrobin62-321-207311,04-Jan-20,"They should have put up a warning that the viewer would be exposed to extremely large of otherworldly, and totally unnecessary, crying by the lead. Without that, and with a faster pace, Midsommar would've been a must-see. Yes, the movie will remind you of The Wicker Man, et. al., except it's a bit more violent and slow. The scenery is nice; too bad it wasn't really shot in Sweden. All the actors were horrible. The version I saw was the Director's Cut, so maybe at 2 hours and 50 minutes it may have been too long. In any case, watch it if you have a fairly strong stomach for violence and extreme amounts of crying. Beware. You've seen this flick before in different incarnations so don't look for anything new here.","

Midsommar," The most expensive unintentional comedy in recent years
",ivan_dmitriev,27-Jun-20,"Well, they tried to be clever and all, but the all the arthouse directing couldn't put this Humpty Dumpty back together again (and yeah it's a pun on the events in the movie).Mostly because it's so ""clever"" but chiefly, because it's a weak knockoff the 1973 Wicker man and doens't even rate close to the Wonderful Women-punching NicolasCageBear-Man remake.It's alternatively boring and unintentially hilarious, the kind of a movie to watch while dusting the shelves.""You're pissing on my people.""-Midsommar","

Midsommar," Watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973 instead...
",danedk,03-Jul-19,"I suspect that reviewers who believe this movie to be the weirdest, most deranged and tripped-out film they've ever seen have not watched many movies. I recommend you watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973, Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" and Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"" before you watch this watered down, pretentious murk in order to get a sense of how movies can truly be mind-altering.
The ""story"" is essentially every cliché of the slasher genre mashed together: a group of young people naively go into the wilderness (Sweden, very scary place lol) and encounter messed up stuff. They each die one by one and, SPOILER ALERT, there is a ""final girl"" who survives in the end. The rest of this cliché story is fluff. If you think, based on the trailer, that much of this film will mirror the original Wicker Man, you are exactly right. There is even a big fire at the end where a guy gets burned alive.
There is a fine line between homage and rip-off and this may a great example of a film that slips over the edge into complete rip-off territory. I won't even go into all the logical loopholes in the story and the scenario, or point out that none of the customs line up at all with ancient Scandinavian rituals (thus making one wonder why this even takes place in Sweden to begin with, like, why couldn't this be a cult in upstate NY?) because there's no point. The script doesn't even attempt to be deep, the research here is sub-Wikepedia level, and the characters are cookie-cutter types you've seen before in a million other horror movies. One logical question I would ask, however, is how come all of these people are anthropology PhD students going to research Scandinavian paganism but none of them speak Swedish??!?!? Has the writer ever even talked to someone with a PhD???
All this said, Florence Pugh is a talented actress and does a great job with the shallow script. She transcends the material and shows that she can be a powerful dramatic actress. The cinematography is gorgeous too. The editing and sound are pitch perfect. I was especially taken by the set design, the use of furniture and quirky wall paintings to give the film a sense of intricate beauty to contrast with the horror. This is all really fabulous and the people who worked on these aspects of the film should be commended. It is all cosmetic, however. Without the mask of beautiful production and a gifted actress, the director/ writer Aster has absolutely nothing going on here.
""Hereditary"" was a very good, solid horror film and I wonder if Aster didn't rush into this sophomore effort too soon. This seems like a script he could have banged out in a night, especially since it feels like something made out of other films. It also seems that Aster repeats some of the same tricks from ""Hereditary""- using shocking, Gaspar Noé-like violence and relying on making his audience feel uncomfortable at the sight of incongruously naked people running around. These stock images are going to get old really fast for him, he needs to work on building up to scares that really pay off.
There will be people who love this director, who are swept away by the cool style and photography of this film or who have simply never seen any of the hundreds of other movies out there with strange imagery and creepy paganism, and these people are going to think this movie is a mind-blower. That's nice, but please watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973 first before you fall in love with this dumpster fire.","
