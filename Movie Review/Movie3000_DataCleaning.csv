"15","x"," a deranged, bloody love letter to tobe hooper","drownsoda90",2022-03-20,"""x"" follows a group of young actors and filmmakers in 1979 who rent out a guest home on an elderly couple's texas farm to covertly shoot a smut film. however, things go awry when their hosts prove to be demented and dangerous.this feature from writer-director ti west (who wrote and directed two solid indie horror films in the 2010s--""the house of the devil"" and ""the innkeepers"") is undoubtedly his most accomplished work to date. while it has all the standard machinations of your typical slasher film, the premise is unique, and the stylistic choices here are effective and inspired by the past in a way that does not feel gimmicky or cheap.while the first half burns slowly, it is peppered with a number of subtle creepy moments that foreshadow the pandemonium that is to come. the cast does a fantastic job, with mia goth making for a very memorable lead; the supporting performances by brittany snow, martin henderson, scott mescudi, and jenna ortega are all equally smart and nicely telegraphed. adding to the ambiance is an eerie western-meets-choral score by folk/goth rock songstress chelsea wolfe to really round things out.above all, the film is a true love letter to the works of tobe hooper. that it draws on hooper's seminal ""the texas chainsaw massacre"" almost goes without saying, but it also pays homage to his lesser-known followup feature ""eaten alive"" in more ways than one. themes of personal autonomy, youth, longing, and regret are neatly folded into the screenplay, serving as springboards for the central conflict that drives the carnage, while hooper's visual influence bleeds through it all.homage aside, what is perhaps most refreshing about ""x"" is that it uses its touchstones wisely, working the slasher formula with intelligence but not veering into self-reflexive territory. in an era where hyper self-awareness has become a diegetic mainstay in horror films, ""x"" opts to check its pretensions at the door. what is surprising is that, in doing so, it still manages to operate as a smart, slick slasher flick. even more than that, it is simply a rollicking good time. 9/10.",9

"17","x"," a sex-crazed gore-fest that lacks its 'x' factor","rebul21",2022-03-20,"after being involved in some great modern horror films such as hereditary (2018) and saint maud (2019), a24's latest film is an immature mess that feels more like an exercise in superfluity than it is a meaningful narrative.set in 1979, x follows six americans as they arrive at an isolated farmhouse for a weekend, intent on shooting a porno. hosted by an unsettling, elderly couple, things soon turn into a full-blown bloodbath.obviously inspired by tobe hooper's classic, the texas chainsaw massacre (1974), writer-director ti west ensured that x was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. mia goth's maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. bobby-lynne, played well by brittany snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. jackson (kid cudi) is a vietnam veteran, while wayne (martin henderson) and rj (owen campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. finishing off the cast, jenny ortega plays the outsider of the group, lorraine.lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. however, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. they will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.from the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. the tv in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. as well as this, a well-crafted shot of lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.this slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. the extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. it seems as if ti west had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. and while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.the editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. alongside this, x lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. the film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.without a strong plot, x fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. the killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic. decently written characters could not make up for some of the bizarre dialogue and while gore was in abundance suspense was not.",4

"20","x"," twisted, disturbing, and surprisingly smart","benjaminskylerhill",2022-03-18,"ti west is an incredibly astute visual director, and with x, he continues to show this. he turns this farmhouse into one of the most hellish nightmares imaginable, where there is no place that is truly safe.that being said, west has never impressed me with his writing before. his earlier films have very little detail put into the characters and themes-they're all concept and little substance. thankfully that's changed with this one. this is probably west's most character-filled film.every single character in this story is incredibly flawed, yet still retains a shred of sympathetic humanity. the protagonists live too much in the moment with no regard for future consequences, while the film's villains yearn for a bygone era of their lives and harbor envy toward those who have what they have lost. each group represents an untenable human desire, and it adds a layer of melancholy to the terror that unfolds.it's not a perfect film; like pretty much all slasher films, there are some characters who exist just to get killed off in predictable fashion, and some death scenes come off as rather anticlimactic.additionally, because every character kind of sucks as a person, there's a two-edged sword in that none of them are particularly likeable and i didn't get attached to them in the way i think west wanted me to.still, this is quite a wild, effectively uncomfortable ride, and a far smarter one than i was expecting.",8

"38","x"," not everything goes together","brent-27849",2022-10-25,"it's funny, i like porn. i like slasher movies. but when this movie put the two together, well, it's not like the person who first decided to put peanut butter and chocolate together, that person was a frickin' genius.for one thing, it's not exactly cutting edge. pretty much every slasher movie in the 1980's have a certain element of soft core porn in them anyway. as for the 1970's look and shooting style. again not overly impressed. to have actors who look like they could be from the seventies, the feather hair, the clothes, but the more i think about it, it feels like it's because of movies made in the 1970's that i think people looked and acted and talked that way than because they really are from the 1970's.the point is there wasn't one character i was particularly interested in. they all seemed to be cliches of cliches, the blond, the linda lovelace wannabe, the guy with the gasoline pump in his pocket. and most of that seemed to be cribbed from movies like boogie nights (not to mention when harry met sally), they're not just doing porn, they're doing art movies and of course they have their own little world in which they look out for each other, they're like a family with a little church mouse too.again it's one of those movies where as soon as a character disappears for more than two minutes, i completely forget they were even in the movie. oh yeah, i forgot about the one in the cellar, how's her hand again? what happened to the blond, she still alive, oh yeah, there she is sleeping.which is the point, first they do the porn stuff and then they do the killing stuff, one by one, off the go. which as another reviewer mentioned, i guessed absolutely every way they were going to be killed. not even one was a surprise. the only thing i messed up on was the order in which they were killed. after the first guy got killed, i figured it would probably be the blond, boy, girl, boy, girl. but no, they killed all the guys first. which really makes me wonder about this world, whatever happened to ladies first?as for the one who survived, yeah, pretty much figured if any of them were going to survive, it would be her. only problem is i have no idea why she did survive. i mean, she is exactly the same as all the rest, not one thing different, so i can't for the life of me figure out why she lived. not that i really cared except in a mildly disappointed way.but of course that leads to the reason behind the killing. i've seen some pretty bad reasons but i honestly can't think of one more stupid. it appears to be because granny ain't gettin' any. that's it. my first thought was well, maybe she should bake a few more pies then, find a hobby. then i thought, well, it's kind of ironic, they're making a porno movie and it never occurs to the old lady to take matters into her own hands, sort to speak, maybe do it the way porn intended. i suppose in the 1970's they didn't have quite the same technical advances but they live on a farm, it can't be that hard to figure it out.of course none was more interesting than wondering why she didn't ask if she could join in. i mean, the movie was called the farmer's daughters, and they already made room for the church mouse to join in, so they could have called it the farmer's daughters, plus one, and granny. they were trying to make an art movie, well it don't get any more artistic than that. the great thing is it would have shown what cheap hypocrites they all were. yes, they have one big scene where they talk about the hypocrisy of prudes and religious folk. ok, well open minded people that they supposedly are, i would have loved to have seen old granny show up ready to get down to business, ready for her close ups. my guess is their open minds would have closed pretty darn fast, about as fast as they're knees.",1

umm... i'm sorry, but the old man randomly having a heart attack in the hallway and dying is the laziest way i have ever seen someone die in a horror/thriller. the script writers were so obsessed with the deaths and gore, but for this guy? nahhh, that was suddenly too much. dies silently and peacefully in the hallway of a heart attack. and wow, the old lady dying is almost as lazy. she gets blown back by firing a rifle, which cripples (?) her and she gets her head ran over by miss goth.-the whole stupid car keys part
the old lady steals the car keys... only for her to easily tell mia where there are in the home (not even hidden or on her where they would've been the safest from being re-claimed by the group) after she realizes her husband has died. could've just left that whole plot device out and everything would've been the same in the story. i'm going to also add that it is very flimsy storytelling that this evil old couple a. died so easily without a fight and b. that the lady told mia where the keys were just because he died. is she suddenly no longer afraid of going to prison? or that this girl she wants so badly will escape?tl;dr - this movie focuses so heavily on gore and sex that it loses all capability of telling a story or creating realistic characters.",1

"82","x"," simultaneously silly, sexy, scary, and revolting","darkreignn",2022-03-20,"i've come to think of film production company a24 as the asylum of art-house films. where the asylum focuses on producing low-budget, direct-to-video films that use film titles and scripts very similar to those of current blockbusters in order to lure customers (shouts out to wikipedia for that beautifully succinct synopsis), a24 also produces movies that - on first glance - look very similar to generic genre films; you don't have to look very far to find the proof of that. films like ""hereditary,"" ""midsommar,"" and ""it comes at night"" all had trailers that marketed the films as scary movies that appealed to mass audiences. those with some semblance of familiarity of a24's track record would know that the above mentioned films would have more up their sleeve, while others may find themselves taken by surprise by how ""different"" the movies are when compared to more mainstream fare. ""x"" is no different. with a trailer that, while stylistic, advertises itself as nothing more than just another slasher, ""x"" entices customers with an accurate premise, only to pull the rug from out under them once they are seated in the theatre.what i like most about a24 is its conviction to add an insane level of quality to what should be nothing more than a disposable saturday night watch. ""x"" advertises itself as a grimy, bloody, slasher movie - and it is - but it's one that prides itself on its high production value. ""x"" is a slasher that actually cares about its story and its characters; remarkably, it is a horror film that works just as well when it's purely being a drama. following a crew of filmmakers who are decidedly set on making an ""artistic"" adult movie, ""x"" is intent on character-building. with all the greed, jealousy, and lustfulness that you might expect from a group of young adults who enjoy making love with each other on camera for money, i was pleasantly surprised that i started to enjoy this movie purely on its own storytelling merits, before the real horror even began.with eye-candy all around in the form of mia goth, jenna ortega, and brittany snow (as well as kid cudi, martin henderson, and owen campbell - if you're into that sort of thing), what impressed me most about ""x"" is that, not only did director ti west pack his movie full of people who can actually act, but he also has crafted characters that are fully fleshed out and feel like real people. unlike your typical slasher, here characters actually make smart decisions and are not just stupid for the sake of being stupid. and this works twofold by drawing viewers into the story before the horror begins, and then amplifying it once it does.with ample care being taken in character, script, plot, and production value (and not to mention the rocking soundtrack), you can only imagine how much care was also taken in the kills. yes, ti west will be sure to gross you out here, because there is blood, guts, and gore aplenty, and all of it wrapped around a unique visual flair and editing style that ups the entertainment value and differentiates this movie from other slashers. there is creativity here, with people dying in unpredictable and uncomfortable ways; i definitely found myself cringing at many of the deaths. so if you enjoy bloody violence, you'll definitely find a lot to like here.if i had any complaints about this movie, which i do, it's that i found the tension building to be slightly lacking. you see, i quite enjoy slashers that have long, drawn out scenes of people trying to escape their murderers (""scream,"" for example), and this movie didn't really have that. while i understand why exactly ""x"" could not have such scenes, it did make the killings slightly lackluster - as in, character goes to place, then they swiftly get killed in said place, and end scene. while the kills themselves are creative, there is a lack of creativity in the build up to those kills. similarly, i did find the motivation of the killer(s) to be somewhat unclear. i mean, i understand why they were doing what they were doing, but i don't really think the motivation was all that believable. also, i found the ending to be rather abrupt and not very climactic or fulfilling. all of that said, ""x"" remained to be extremely entertaining.""x"" won't be for everyone - when the movie ended, a middle-aged man turned to his date and said, ""that was the weirdest movie i have ever seen."" a couple sat next to me, and basically sprinted out of the theatre as soon as the credits rolled. however, its almost maddening attention to quality and detail elevates it above other, similar, slasher movies, making this one very memorable horror film.",7

'x' may be his best film yet. this one is a blast.this film created something very few modern horror films are able to - tension. i found myself very tense during this film. it's actually a very patient film though. the build-up is methodical and slow with only little hints as to what is to come. because of the strong characters and dialogue though it is never dull or boring.then when the action does kick in in the final third of the film it is a wild ride. all the pieces that have been masterfully set up fall into place and nothing is off limits. no character felt safe and i absolutely love that feeling in a horror film. the editing style ad the way it used in some of the horror sequences really caught me (and some other audience members) off guard. i had never seen anything like that in a film before, but it worked so well.there is some great chemistry amongst this cast. all six of the main leads nailed it. i have to say my jaw was hanging when i read that mia goth played both 'maxine' and 'pearl'. are you kidding me? that is some truly incredible make-up work and acting.it sounds like we are getting a prequel to this film soon and i am here for it. if it's even half as good as this one then it will be worth the price of admission. see this one. 9/10.",9

"106","x"," ah, i was pleased","bandsaboutmovies",2022-04-18,"consider the law of diminishing returns: x is the best slasher that i've seen all year, last year, the year before and probably for the rest of this year.it may also be the law of the desert island in that it may be the only slasher in years that approaches the blood-soaked heaven of 1978-1981, yet were it released then, would i feel the same way?and after seeing tweet after tweet about how debauched and filthy and sexed-up this movie was, did we see the same film? or am i really the ""affable pervert"" that grindhouse releasing said i was and i've become too desensitized? or, probably more true, has this generation become more puritanical and repressed than we were?probably most importantly, i decided to just shut up and enjoy the movie.what i came away with was a film that actually gave me that uncomfortable and awesome feeling of ""i wonder what's next"" and a worry for each of its characters.back in 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make a dirty film in rural texas, learning nothing from another texas-shot slasher. and when their elderly hosts discover what's happening, the cast find themselves in a way different movie.reading that description, i felt sure that i would dislike this movie, but then again, this was ti west, who somehow took a very basic story in the house of the devil and made something great and lasting.i've been burned by an a24 trailer before. come on, we all have. but again, i decided to shut up and watch the movie.and i'm glad that i did.maxine minx (mia goth, nymphomaniac) dreams of being an adult film star and people knowing her name. this brings her to deepest, darkest new zealand, err texas, along with her producer/boyfriend/suitcase pimp wayne (martin henderson), director rj (owen campbell), his assistant/girlfriend lorraine (jenna ortega, scream) and two co-stars, bobby-lynne (brittany snow, the perfect pitch movies) and jackson hole (kid cudi!). as they go deeper into the rural world, we're reminded - of course - of that aforementioned texas film, what with the van that propels them and the farmhouse they end up in.rj has a goal. just because it's porn doesn't mean that it can't be art, he says, almost like a non-burnt out gary graver. wayne knows something more important: porno chic died because middle america is stil too afraid to go to a porno theater and still blushes when they buy a skin mag. but if they can have that movie in the safety of their home? he's ahead of the video era, caballero and vca before they'd even realized what was next. the themes of this movie are desire and age battling hand in hand and the fact that the new type of entertainment they're making is based on the oldest joke there is - the farmer's daughters - points to the intelligence of this endeavor.meanwhile, there's howard (stephen ure) and pearl (also mia goth, we'll get to that shortly), the elderly couple who owns the land. howard barks at everyone while pearly stays in the shadows, except for the moment where she invites maxine in for lemonade, a remembrance of youth, some jealousy and a rebuffed sexual december to may advance.that afternoon, pearl watches maxine and jackson at work and begs howard to make love to her one more time, but while the spirit and the emotional heart are willing, the flesh and the physical heart are weak.that night, lorraine surprises everyone by asking if she can be in the film. rj tries to use art as the reason why the script can't be changed; she defeats his argument and he watches her make love through the eye of his camera. that night, he leaves everyone behind but runs into pearl and that's where - nearly an hour into the film - ""don't fear the reaper"" plays and we're reminded of exactly what kind of movie we're in for.the end of the film surprised me. i should have seen it coming, but the repeated dialogue, the divine intervention and greek chorus of televangelists all came together in a way that i had no idea was going to occur. seriously, that preacher gives estus pirkle a run for his money.i also had no idea that goth spent ten hours a day in makeup for the dual role, which she'll take up again in pearl, a prequel that was shot at the same time as this movie.even the soundtrack works, written by tyler bates and chelsea wolfe, who covers fred fisher's ""oui, oui, marie."" what doesn't, however, is the moment where snow and kudi sing ""landslide,"" as we've already established the closeness of the actors and this seems only in the movie to have them remind us they also do music.as bad as 2022's texas chainsaw massacre is, this is good. it feels closer to eaten alive, another hooper film, what with the alligator scene - i winced when someone claimed this movie had a scene that echoed alligator - and i love how the final girl is the least chaste character in the movie, continually doing drugs and putting herself first.here's to more horror being committed to only being inspired by the past instead of wallowing within it, pushing itself to new heights. i was worried if west would ever come close to house again; my fears were unnecessary.",7

"115","x"," a retrospective slasher, looking back at the classics.","movieman6-413-929510",2022-03-19,"x is a new horror film directed and written by ti west, the director of the house of the devil.the film is set in 1979 where a group of young people try to make a new and unique porn film. they have found the right place for this in texas, namely a ranch of a parental farmer couple. the youths try to keep what they use the ranch a secret from the parents, because they know they are committing sins in their eyes. if the youngsters are caught, everything changes and the youngsters suddenly have to fight for their lives.with this film, ti west manages to make a good retrospective film, which looks back in a playful way to the beginning slasher films such as friday the 13th and the texas chainsaw massacre. apart from some twists and turns, it is unfortunately otherwise a standard slasher, trying to revive the classics. for example, the film is entertaining for slasher fans, but can also be a bit on the familiar or even predictable side.like many slashers, the film has a slow pace, which gradually builds up over time to gory, filthy or scary scenes. for a more unique film, ti west could have been a bit more creative, because apart from a hidden message in the film, the film is also a bit clich√©. slasher connoisseurs know in advance what is about to happen and where the film is going. as a result, they can lose interest in the film while watching.what works best in the film are the details that ti west has used in the film. this way the place where the film takes place comes across well, because if you keep listening carefully you can hear the farming environment of the farm in the film. for example, you can hear the wind blowing through the grains or the crickets and other insects in the background. he also knows how to play nice with the camera because of the way he portrays things just to sometimes lead you as a viewer astray.the makeup effects also work well in the movie. most of the blood and other gory things seem believable and even the parental couple who are actually played by younger actors really do come across as a bunch of elderly people thanks to their prosthetic make-up.the acting is also done well and appropriately by the film cast. martin henderson comes across as someone who is trying to make his own passion movie that is better than the rest of the movies that are being made. he just lacks the right insight to make this happen. owen campbell and jenna ortega try to help him as the people behind the camera, but sometimes end up in conflict with each other. brittany snow and kid cudi play the porn actors and know well the difference in the kind of acting they do compared to the official work of real actors. that way they know that their viewers won't be that interested in the story of the film, as long as they see their creations naked in the film. the best acting comes from mia goth, who again shows with this film that she is a daring actress, who does not try hard to make something special out of her roles. in this film she even plays a hidden double role. jenna ortega and mia goth show with this film how they grow as actresses in the film world.",5

"117","x"," predictable and uninspired.","meddlecore",2022-10-23,"""is it possible to make a good dirty movie? "" is the question that director ti west poses in this vintage-style backwoods slasher pic.the story focuses on a hustler from houston, who brings his young fianc√© to a remote town in the bible belt, where he plans to shoot a series of interracial porn videos featuring her, a local stripper and vietnam vet.his plan being to make his belle a star.west filters the above question through the character of the cameraman, who seeks to shoot the raunchy films like a more classy and respectable form of cinema.this all takes place in a flashback...with the intro revealing to us, that at some point...things took a very dark and violent turn.the group rents out a dilapidated old farmhouse- built during the revolutionary war- on a strange old man's property.but doesn't really bring him up to speed on their planned activities.when it all plays out...it feels like west was going for a backwoods slasher gore film with a bit of a giallo vibe.but it lacks the mystery that a good giallo film has entirely...as it is just way too predictable.albeit creepily so.you can tell he is going for the shock value that films like tcm and wolf creek possess.but despite attempts to be lurid, it comes off way too tame.leaving you waiting for that bruno dumont moment at the end...which never comes to fruition.so you can't help but feel like ""ugh"".as it comes off much too fake and lame.the ""old face"" costumes certainly didn't help on this front.they should've just cast some real, creepy looking, old people instead.cause, in the end, there's a whole lot of atmosphere, but not a whole lot else.so the high expectations they build up in the beginning just go straight out the window.going back to the question posed near the beginning...the answer is yes...but you're going to have to ask someone like gaspar noe or pasolini.not west.because, wheras i do like his style...this one is a bit of a fail.it could have, and should have been better.the only redeeming quality i see in it, is that west writes his relationship with mia goth into it (in regards to him making her into a household name as ""his"" star).that is actually pretty cool.but that's about all it has going for it, in my opinion.3.5 out of 10.",3

"120","x"," entertaining enough, you get what you came for","horst_in_translation",2022-05-03,"""x"" is a co-production between the united states and canada that resulted in this really new 2022 english-language horror film. it runs for slightly over 100 minutes and i see this made it into the imdb top10 on the moviemeter, so surely a big success and it was even higher, almost top5, the previous week. i got to watch this film on the occasion of a recurring horror event series at a local cinema and thought i'd share my thoughts with you now. don't expect a great deal of structure. first of all, you could wonder what the title is about. it does not get any shorter than this. there is talk about one character having the so-called x-factor that separates her from the rest. then again, if you triple the title, you will get a completely different meaning, namely ""sex"" that also fits in terms of the film's contents. i will get to that later on. the writer and director here is ti west. he has been pretty prolific in the last 20 years with short films, full feature films and, most recently, television episodes, but this movie here has a really realistic shot at becoming his most known and most seen work so far. maybe even his best. i see people (especially critics) liked the outcome, some even a lot, so we can be curious if he will move on to other genres in the future. hollywood stuff. there has been a lot of focus on horror for him so far and like it happens so often with filmmakers from this genre, he also worked in many other production departments of his releases. as for the cast, the most known member you see on the photo here is mia goth, mostly thanks to her work with lars von trier and she is divorced from shia labeouf now, but still became a mom recently. oh well, it is their private stuff, but i guess certain characters in this film would not like something like that too much either. other cast members in here you may have come across in the ring, pitch perfect, need for speed or the new scream movie. one of them is maybe even more known as a musician than actor. kid cudi i mean of course.this is a film that fits the description of film on film. we have a gang of relatively young people who in the year 1979 plan on shooting an adult film inside a farm house they rented for this occasion. of course, without telling the old owners about their intentions. the first meeting there is pretty heated already when the old man forgot who they are there and is ready to shoot the film's producer. eventually it deescalates, but it is a bit of foreshadowing to everything that happens during one fateful night later on. that night is pretty much the violent center of the movie. before that, a lot is implied and there is a great deal of tension, like also with the alligator that almost catches goth's character without her realizing one bit, but not a lot of violence. we find out about the group mechanics, about the relationships the characters have with each other. i guess if you are a heterosexual male or homosexual female or just bisexual, you will certainly have a soft spot for one of the females in this film. there's a blonde who is a bit stuck-up, goth's character, who is a self-confident brunette with big ambitions and finally the girl who is just an assistant with the microphone initially. the church mouse as she is called by another character repeatedly, but she also discovers some darkness inside her when she (not too unexpectedly) wants to act in the film as well. the brief initial conversation between church mouse and the blonde girl is also among the more comedic moments this film has to offer. i think it was ""yeah, sometimes"" what the girls replied in different contexts when being asked about their boyfriends. it sure is about the comedy here and there. martin henderson also gets in a solid amount. he reminded me a bit of bradley cooper and i mean that in the most positive way as i am not too big on cooper. like when he shows up only in his underwear on one occasion and tries to help another character in finding her boyfriend, it was a bit on the funny side. also when he starts his little speech inside the barn it was funny how they made him look so experienced in life. that life was not meant to go on for much longer. what he steps on is bad enough already, but what happens later on is even worse.the guys get it way before the girls in here. you could even think that two of the girls maybe make it out alive in the end, but eventually it is just goth's character. no surprise. she's the star. the other one with the dark hair, her actress is really, really young, was trapped in the cellar. another horror film tradition and when she manages to almost get out, her captor is there to make sure she stays down. i found her reaction a bit exaggerated when goth's character comes to help her, but maybe it was meant like this to depict the escalation that finally led to her death in that scene. and after all, after what she saw down there, it feels kinda justified to go full panic mode. with the adult film aspect in this film, you will also see a lot of nudity of course, some sex scenes, but it is never an adult film or so like the one they are shooting in this film. there is even a reference to another classic in terms of success they want to match with when one character mentions debbie does dallas. oh and the nerdy guy from the gang also gets in some comedy when he keeps talking about the artistic approach to his work and how he sees himself as much more than a porn crew member. a bit of a running gag. he was also if you want to call it that maybe the least superficial member from the gang. surely a bit naive too and eventually it costs him and he is killed first. so yeah, you get to see nudity, but also west plays a bit with the audience there as if you want the young ones, you also have to sit through a sex scene between the old folks and goth's character is right under the bed to witness it first-hand before she tries to get out. then again, now i saw that goth played the female there too, so a double performance. the older woman she portrays here will also get her own film apparently set back many decades in the past and west and goth already worked on that one, so x will not stay the only film with these characters. or of course only with the young characters, but pearl/goth will be back eventually.okay, what else can be said about this one? i quite liked the farm setting, also that there are not too many characters and of course the number decreases as the film goes on. they had to get in the crocodiles as well after those did not succeed in getting their food on the first occasion. really nice way to film it from up above, at that point still in broad sunlight. the death scenes are indeed pretty graphic with all the blood splattering. not a film for the young ones. bit it feels realistic, so all is good and how it should be. there is also solid depth to the characters and actually a bit of a touching story linked to the old ones, like how the old guy struggles with accepting the fact that he cannot satisfy his partner's lust anymore. well, you see what happens when he goes for it in the end. at the same time, he develops some kind of hatred against the young people that come to his place and makes them fully responsible for enticing his wife. take the gunpoint situation i mentioned already, but also when he is there with them and does not stare at one character because she turned him on, or at least not primarily, but because he just despises her so much. and also all the others. early on, i thought it was just the old dame killing people, but he gets his share too pretty quickly. oh yes, i must totally mention additional comedy moments. most of all, the preacher you see on television. that was some really smart and interesting inclusion how he elaborates there and what he has to say exactly and how it sometimes fits the context of the film. nicely done for sure. also how his tape is still running when the police show up in the end. by the way, did the old lady die too then? i think she only broke her hip initially, but no clue when they got there and found them.anyway, this black police officer was a riot too. already at the very start, but also at the end when he has no clue what sick events may have happened there at the farm. or actually his very last words, the very final words of the film i am talking about: they were basically directed at the audience and this is where they created a parallel between the movie the young people were trying to make and the movie we were watching. something really negative to say about this film? maybe that we did not get to see jenna ortega during the act. okay sorry, i know it is not an adult film. as for graphic moments, it is not just violence. also look at cocaine (ab)use for example on two or three occasions. but nothing like that felt for the sake of it, so it is really nice. the quote that went basically like something how you should not live a life you do not deserve, but aim for something better instead was also one i liked and we heard it on a few occasions. the context or how the characters used it may have been a bit absurd, but the message behind it all is something i definitely approve of. okay, this is it then. i am glad i watched this film and also glad that the room was pretty packed, actually so packed that they showed it a second time starting 20 minutes later for everybody who did not manage to get tickets for the initial showing. this is a film that deserves to be seen. and i think it will be, so it's all fine. never dragged, which is good for a film as close to two hours as it is to the

(and, i will some day because i must buy this film soon.)i truly loved both movies and the overall experience. it had nods to so many other horror movies while still being its own thing. heck, it even referenced my two favorite tv shows as a kid: the incredible hulk and wonder woman. not horror. just a bonus.the acting was spot-on, the dialogue, sets and fashions were perfect and the movie was tense from beginning to end. in fact, it ultimately rewards you for being on the edge of your seat.i'm not saying...yet...this is a perfect horror movie, but it's so darn close to being perfect, i can't wait to see this again. (possibly tomorrow since i have a 48-hour rental.)***final thoughts: that all said...i couldn't get past the same live church feed would be broadcast on the tele 24-hours a day in 1979. someone please correct me if that was a thing for maybe conservative, deep into lost texas small towns back then.",10

"160","x"," x","jboothmillard",2022-04-02,"i spotted this scary movie listed at a few of the cinemas, i was intrigued by the title, i became interested because of the leading actress from a cure for wellness, and the plot sounded interesting, so i went for it. basically, set in 1979, maxine minx (mia goth) is a pornographic film actress embarking on a road trip through texas with her producer boyfriend wayne (the ring's martin henderson), fellow porn stars bobby-lynne (pitch perfect's brittany snow) and jackson hole (scott mescudi aka kid cudi), director rj (owen campbell) and rj's girlfriend lorraine (jenna ortega) to shoot an adult movie for the booming video market. bobby-lynne and jackson start to become romantic, lorraine is unimpressed with the content of the film, and rj is wanting to make it seem like a serious piece of cinema. wayne has arranged for the group to stay at the farm of elderly couple howard (stephen ure) and pearl (mia goth) who have a guesthouse. howard is temperamental towards the group and carries a shotgun while pearl is entranced by maxine and silently stalks her. the group intends to shoot on location, without the couple's knowledge, with a farm related theme and storyline. filming commences with bobby-lynne and jackson having sex. meanwhile, maxine wanders up to the couple's house, she is invited inside by pearl who offers a drink of lemonade, they have a conversation. pearl laments her age, expresses jealousy for maxine's youth, and makes a sexual advance towards her. maxine returns to the group a little shaken by pearl's behaviour but calms down. she films her sex scene with jackson, she and the others are unaware that pearl is watching from outside and is aroused. following what she has seen, pearl pleads with howard for them to have sex, but he refuses, reminding her that he has a weak heart. night falls and the film crew relax in their farmhouse. lorraine is usually prudish, having assisted filming the performers have sex, and being intrigued and turned on, she wants to shed her reputation, but rj is upset when she asks to be in the film. wayne says that lorraine can make her own decisions and allows her to take part if she wants to, and eventually rj agrees to shoot a scene between lorraine and jackson. but rj becomes so furious over her unfaithfulness that he intends to drive away while the others are asleep. he is shocked by pearl, who suddenly appears and attempts to seduce him; he is repulsed and pushes her away, so she pulls out a knife and stabs him to death. lorraine and wayne notice rj is missing and go looking for him. wayne wanders into a barn after hearing noises, and gets a nail stuck in his foot, before being stabbed in the eye through a peephole, and with a pitchfork by pearl. lorraine approaches the couple's house and is invited in by howard who claims pearl is missing. he asks lorraine to get a flashlight in the basement, she finds it, then screams in terror seeing the rotting corpse of a missing man and trying to flee she finds the basement door has been locked. jackson gets out of bed and howard arrives asking him to help him find his wife. meanwhile, pearl enters the guesthouse and climbs into maxine's bed naked. while searching the woodland area, jackson finds a pond with a car submerged in the mud, then howard appears and shoots him dead, revealing himself to be complicit in pearl's violent tendencies. back at the house, lorraine finds an axe and breaks her way through the door to reach the lock, only for howard to attack her, breaking her finger and forcing her back down. maxine wakes and screams finding pearl lying naked next to her. pearl walks out the house, with bobby-lynne witnessing and following her to the lake. bobby-lynne tries to take pearl back to the farm, but pearl angrily insults her. bobby-lynne scoffs at her before being pushed into the lake where she is eaten by an alligator. maxine sees pearl and howard return to the guesthouse and hides under the bed. the elderly couple talk about the murders before having sex. maxine manages to crawl out from under the bed and runs to the crew's van, finding rj's dead body, and the keys missing. maxine grabs a pistol from the van's glovebox and enters the farmhouse, finding and freeing lorraine, who angrily blames maxine for what has happened. lorraine panics and runs out the front door, only to be fatally shot by howard. the elderly couple intend to frame the crew as intruders on their property and start to move the bodies. lorraine splutters before dying, startling howard, and causing him to have a fatal heart attack. maxine holds pearl at gunpoint, who begs her to help her husband, she demands the keys to the truck. she attempts to shoot pearl only to discover that the gun is unloaded. pearl takes howard's shotgun and attempts to shoot maxine, but the force from the shotgun blasts her out of the house. pearl lies helpless on the ground with a broken hip and begs maxine for help. maxine refuses and she shouts insults her, until maxine runs her over with the truck, crushing pearl's head. maxine is the lone survivor and drives away from the farm. the next morning, the police have arrived at the house. an evangelical programme is seen frequently playing on pearl and howard's television, and on the programme, it is revealed that maxine is the daughter of a conservative christian preacher (simon prast). sheriff dentler (james gaylyn) is informed that a film camera (rj's) has been found, and the officers speculate about what it contains. also starring geoff dolan as deputy, matthew j. saville as officer mitchell, and bryony skillington as store clerk. goth is becoming something a scary movie regular, she is terrific as the lead, but also unrecognisable and highly creepy as the horny old woman, ure is equally nasty as her hubby helping her fulfil her sick fantasies, snow is amusing as the ditsy promiscuous porn actress, and there is good support from ortega, kid cudi and campbell. it is a simple and familiar concept, a group of young adults wind up at the wrong place at the wrong place, with a pair of psychopathic pensioners, it is obviously influenced by and pays homage to classics like the texas chain saw massacre, psycho and the shining. the sexual stuff is very reminiscent and certainly looks like something out of the 70s, while the scares mostly come from how bizarre the old characters are and the grizzly gory deaths, i'm glad it was the kind of film i was expecting, a worthwhile erotic slasher horror. good!",6

"177","x"," ""their eyes are gonna' pop out of their damn skulls when they see this.""","mattstone137",2022-03-18,"from the upstanding citizens at a24 comes x, a film reminiscent of those good ole' 70s flicks in both style and structure. ti west, who has dabbled in horror and television throughout his career, writes, directs, and produces, lending the film a personal, suspenseful touch. x is a straightforward film, with many of the classical slasher trappings, like the rural setting, gas station detour, and warped sense of puritanical morality. it boasts few surprises but is steadfast and deliciously languid enough to be engaging. the viewing experience is a counterbalance between unfulfilled mystery and gory, kinetic thrills.the film follows a group of six young adults as they make a pornographic film in the nearby boardroom of an elderly couple. our heroes are in it for money and fame, hoping to latch onto the currently blooming industry of porn-on-video. but as day turns to night there are sinister happenings afoot and the promise of sensual delights is suddenly much less sweet.the most persistent element of the film is reverence for the style and aesthetics of 70s film. x's mode of suspense is usually pitched somewhere between breathtaking and harrowing, and features the avantgarde scene transitions of easy rider. i failed to understand the choice in that film, and i fail to understand it in x; there's simply no relevant information in the frequent, jumpy juxtapositions. although x has many 70s trappings, it only passingly succeeds in evoking the independent attitude and existential dread of that era. the emulation, like most concerns beyond the gore, seems underbaked and purposeless.the film's greatest asset is its patience and gradual build of dread. west's camera roves and watches, peeking through swampy marshes and through windows to give the sense of eerie voyeurism, much like a viewer expects from the type of smut our protagonists are filming. the film has time to breathe, often opting for longer takes and an enhanced sense of place and spatial continuity. for all of the breezy porno style and action during the day, x is ultimately a film of shadows, of creeping gremlins and unseen dangers. if nothing else, it's an engaging and entertaining watch, even if the pieces don't quite add up.although the film works moment to moment, it never fulfills greater expectations, either structurally or thematically. this is a premise which promises twists, shocks, and gob smacking revelations, but delivers on little more than suspense and gore. there's nothing under the surface, nothing to satisfyingly explain the many character quirks throughout and nothing which adds any depth or complexity to the religious pretext we're shown repeatedly. x, as a slasher, exists in a middle limbo, between hopelessly dumb films like friday the 13th or my bloody valentine and the more nuanced, restrained fare of texas chainsaw or halloween. x is not ""elevated horror"" but it's not shlock either. it's a respectable, entertaining slasher, but that's all it is.the script itself is weak. the dialogue is often cliched and offers little glimpse into the characters' inner lives. they each have their own quirk, but nothing to flesh them out, to generate real empathy. motivations are lacking too. our protagonists' reasoning is minimal, but reasonable and varied. some want money, others fame, and one even wants to prove respectable smut is possible. it's all believable, if not hugely compelling.our antagonists' motivations, on the other hand, are reductive and intellectually lazy. there's little reason for them to act as they do once, and the idea that this is a recurring circumstance is laughably absurd. the fear and distrust of conservatism is another element x shares with easy rider; the old folks in this film are reminiscent of the two yokels who slaughter hopper and fonda to end that film. they're actions are just as rash, and just as unlikely.the absence of any truly relatable or compelling characters makes x's overall framework as creaky as the film's civil war era boarding room. there are no greater thematic or dramatic statements to validate the ""porno meets slasher"" concept. many of the plot elements feel disjointed and tacked on - no greater cohesion exists. there is a repeated and murkily vague commentary about religion which is never developed and amounts to little more than a final, wildly convenient shock. the film is effective and engaging enough to make you watch, but not so effective it will make you think.the more technical elements are nice individually but greater than their sum. the cinematography is crisp and stark. it's both colorful enough to evoke the 70s mood but desaturated enough to distill some intrinsic dread. when night comes shadows rule, draped across the land and lit only by an unsettlingly realistic bluish glow.the soundtrack is interesting, though as rote as the dialogue at points and sometimes overbearing, being used to drive the suspense rather than the other way around. again, both of these elements - in addition to the set design and sound mixing - are impressive on their own, but don't mesh as a holistic vision. x is frustratingly satisfying.the cast is small and generates nice chemistry. the performances can't salvage one-note characters but they do imbue them with energy, sex appeal, and charisma. martin henderson, kid cudi, and brittany snow are good as the more confident and self-assured of the group, each as ambitious or laidback as the material calls for. owen campbell is convincing as an obsessed cinephile trying to make a point and mia goth is contemplative and vulnerable.jenny ortega (who's busy 2022 already includes releases x, studio 666, and scream 5) is underutilized and her character has little to do. the elderly couple play the horror broadly, speaking, moving, and doing at a belabored pace. stephen ure plays howard and i don't know who plays pearl; the actress isn't listed in the credits and i can't find the information online. seems like an odd, rather disrespectful oversight.x would've benefited from a more explicit or exploitative approach, especially considering the era and films it attempts to emulate; the porno scenes are oddly restrained and even respectful, and the film takes itself too seriously to have a viscerally gonzo good time between the sex and slashing. the setup and daylight sequences are the most tense and taut - the actual slashing is standard stuff. in eschewing the more exploitive elements of its premise, the film also doesn't pull off the sudden shift it aims for. the hint of gory exploits to come overpowers the daylight fun and stifles our protagonists' filmmaking ambitions.final note, nitpicky but important. the porno within the film never feels convincing for its construction or era. the lighting within is homogenous, always bright, flat, and overly clean despite a location change. at one point, the porno is shot from within a dimly lit barn, but the results are as bright, flat, and clear as when shot from the more adequately lit bedroom. the porno also cuts within itself like an already-edited sequence. again, these may be nitpicks but they're important nitpicks. x is a film that relies on its details for immersion, and the immersion is fractured when the details aren't realized.at the end of the day, x is a diverting film. it's suspenseful and patient, two of the most important elements of a good slasher, and the setting and premise are direct but novel. it meets expectations, even if it's also an ultimately simple, straightforward film. its attempts at deeper religious critiques fall flat, but it does stand out in the rote and uninspired filmography of ""non-renaissance"" contemporary horror. i was entertained, but that's all i was. once the film ends, it begins to leave the memory, mixing and mashing with all of its influences and remembered more by what could've been than what was. fans of horror, particularly slashers, will enjoy it, but if a bloody, sexy, chilling tale of lust and violence isn't for you, then i advise you to stay away.7/10.",7

"222","x"," a soft-core slasher thrill","thetyvonlesure",2022-10-02,"x is a simple, yet effective horror movie that takes a demented twist on vintage pornography. the film is centered around a group of adult filmmakers, as they spend the night at an elderly couple's cottage. the horror-thriller stars mia goth as maxine/pearl, jenny ortega as lorraine, brittany snow as bobby-lynne, kid cudi as jackson, stephen ure as howard, martin henderson as wayne, and owen campbell as rj. this is the first film in ti west's ""x"" trilogy and it serves as a sinful love letter to the slasher films of the 70s.the story is straightforward, well-paced, and engaging. the horror/slasher genre has explored many settings and themes. everso often the genre punishes the characters for violating the ""rules"" of the game via immorality. x is no different, however the concept of morality is explored from the frame of ""immorality"" is moralitly. the protagonists and antagonists are each victims of their own desires. sex is effectively juxtaposed to religion. the film pits both concepts at odds. as the first film in the trilogy, x presents each character in a manner that entices the viewer to want more. depth is well-applied to each character through dialogue and nonverbal expressions. plot points are foreshadowed with effective pay-offs. at times the simplicity hurts the film. there's not much to the story outside of what is presented. in an era of psychological horror-thrillers, this film finds itself being fairly undemanding. it's not much of a ""scary"" movie. however, despite the film not being ""scary,"" the tension building is enticing.the cast has great chemistry. mia goth's portrayal of both maxine and pearl are distinct. each character shares motivation, however each are different. maxine is relatively harmless and bright eyed, where as pearl is cynical and seasoned. each character has a different twang to their southern accents. goth makes each character unique and special in their own rights. brittany snow stands out as bobby-lynne. snow's delivery of a porn starlet is outlandish for her filmography, however she fits perfectly in the role. bobby-lynne is the base for the sexuality that the film exhumes. kid cudi's portrayal of jackson is solid. jackson is a warm character, yet masculine character that adds an air of ease to the cast. stephen ure, jenny ortega, martin henderson, and owen campbell are all good in their roles. each character interaction is natural. the film's charm is predicated on the cast's chemistry. whereas most slasher film throws random personalities together, x throws like-minded parties into the bog and comes out clean.the cinematography is a throw-back to 70s films. the camera zooms and encloses into characters from a wide shot, delivering a vintage experience. at times, the film mimics that of 70s pornography taking a 4:3 aspect ratio, providing an air of authenticity. lighting is used effectively. the film is very dark at times, adding to the overall tension. the use of the color red enhances the deaths, as well as the gore within the film. largely, the film is well-edited. moments of tension are matched with sex scenes in a manner that successfully juxtaposes the scenes while telling one cohesive story.overall, x is a simple, yet enjoyable slasher flick. it effectively pays homage to classic slasher thrillers, while placing its own stamp on the genre. the film is bolstered by the cast's chemistry and engaging cinematography. the use of sex and religion is thematically well crafted. ti west constructs a soft-core horror porno that leaves much to be explored.",8

let down. ti west is a writer/director who has movies that i enjoy, so that added to it. from the bit of the trailer i saw, this had my attention. jaime and i went to see this at the gateway film center during opening weekend. i've now given it a second viewing ahead of making my top horror films of 2022 list.synopsis: in 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives.now the synopsis is a bit off, but that is the gist of the movie. we start by seeing the aftermath of something. sheriff dentler (james gaylyn) arrives and he's joined by deputies and other police officers. whatever happened here was a bloodbath. the movie then shifts 24 hours before.we then meet maxine (mia goth). she is in a dressing room and snorting cocaine. she is joined by her boyfriend, wayne (martin henderson), who is also her boss. from what i'm gathering, maxine is a stripper of sorts. she works with bobby-lynne (brittany snow). as the premise said, they're going off to rural texas to make an adult film. wayne is the executive producer. the director and cinematographer is rj (owen campbell). he also wrote the screenplay. also joining them is his girlfriend, lorraine (jenna ortega), who is working as the boom microphone operator as well as his production assistant. the male star of this movie is jackson (kid cudi).the movie does well in establishing that during this time in in texas, things are hard. to save money, they're renting a boarding house from howard (stephen ure). it is a long drive to get there. they are also in a deeply religious area. we get this from a gas station they stop off at where the clerk is watching a televangelist on television. this minister is simon prast. i should also point out that howard watches this same preacher at home.just a bit more background about our group, maxine wants to be a star and will do whatever she can to get there. bobby-lynne understands her place and doesn't have issues using her body to get what she wants. wayne wants to make money and i like that he even references debbie does dallas as his inspiration for what he is doing. rj wants to be a real filmmaker and he sees this as his first chance.when they arrive at the farm, they're 'greeted' by howard. he doesn't seem to remember their agreement and he's not nice. there is an uneasy understanding between him and wayne. it doesn't help that wayne is a smooth talker. howard wouldn't approve of what they're doing either. maxine notices someone looking down at them from a window. this turns out to be howard's wife, pearl.our group goes about shooting their movie, but things take a dark turn as our hosts are scarier than the group originally thought.now that seems like enough of fleshing out the synopsis and introducing our characters a bit more. where i want to start is that i believe this movie does a great job at its set up. jaime and i were talking after the movie ended and i said that west is known for doing slow-burns. she didn't think this movie was slow from the start. i can agree with her there, but the horror elements don't start until i'd say past the halfway point. she pointed out though, we get the making of this adult film that keeps your interest until then. i agree there. i'd even go farther to say that dread starts the moment this group gets into the rural part of texas. they're from houston if memory serves. where they go is closer to louisiana as we are getting bayous. this movie does feel like it borrows a bit from the texas chain saw massacre or even eaten alive. i don't mind the paying homage with the story elements. with this second watch, i noticed there are also ones to certain shots and how things are framed which i appreciate.where i'll take this then is the social commentary here. some people might groan at this, but it is done subtle. the major one we get is sexuality. maxine and bobby-lynne both are comfortable with theirs. they don't mind getting naked or having sex with someone they don't have deeper feelings for. wayne has even come to terms with it from life experiences. both women have sex with jackson on film. maxine has an interesting backstory that doesn't necessarily add a lot, but it is an interesting reveal. knowing this coming in makes more sense with a recurring item. now we are juxtaposing this with lorraine. her nickname in the movie is 'church mouse'. she doesn't talk a lot. she also stares at the other women and they think she is a prude. she does surprise everyone by also wanting to be in the movie after they've gotten started. this is interesting as it upsets rj. this becomes the catalyst for the events of the night.sticking with the idea of sexuality, we have pearl. she interacts with maxine and we get some reveals to her character through pictures. i didn't understand fully until things that happen later. this elderly couple harbors secrets and i found it to be interesting. i do find some of this problematic though, just due to their age and how things play out. it doesn't ruin the movie though. this is also taking on the idea of sexuality and contrasting it to religion. it tends to make people more prudish, hence the nickname for lorraine and things that are said by the televangelist. it makes sense for a reveal of a character for sure. our group also knows that what they're doing is wrong in not telling howard. wayne is taking advantage of him. it also builds tension with worry about him finding out. to finish out this idea on secrets, it is interesting that howard watches this preacher on television, while also doing the things that he does and covering for his wife.i don't think there is more that i need to go into with the story, so i'll take this to the acting. i thought it was good across the board. goth is solid as our lead here. she is one that doesn't do a lot, but i'm loving that she's stuck to the horror genre for most of her young career so far. what works for her is that she is determined to be a star. there is also a past with her that worked. she just goes beyond her character as well. ortega is good as our reserved woman in the group. i liked seeing snow as the more sexualized lady. we do see her and goth nude if you're interested. kid cudi was good as jackson. i liked henderson as our greasy character. i was glad to see campbell here as he's an actor that has impressed me in everything that i've seen, this included. ure and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.that will then take me to the effects, cinematography and soundtrack. this movie becomes a slasher film with exploitation elements. i like that the kills are implementing different tools you'd find on a farm. that adds a good element. they are also brutal. from what i could tell they were practical. if not, they hid what they were doing well which worked for me. the cinematography is great. we get some beautiful shots and i also think it is edited masterfully. there is homage here as well with some shots to texas chainsaw which i thought were a good touch. the soundtrack is something else that i thought works well. we get songs from the era. there is also music that ramps up the tension and the atmosphere.in conclusion, i'm glad that i saw this. we are getting an interesting period piece slasher film. there are elements that add commentary, which ticks boxes for me. the acting is good across the board. i thought the effects were as well and they go brutal. this movie looks beautiful and of the era. what they do with the soundtrack works as well. i'll be honest that i have this up there as one of my favorite west films. i thought this was good after my first viewing and that is just cemented with giving it a rewatch. one of my favorites of the year, as well as in the slasher genre in general.my rating: 9 out of 10.",9

(my previous score was 6/10, that score has certainly gone up now.) it was cool to catch the moments where the two movies intertwined.pearl had lived this life for so many decades and is still going strong. (apparently her husband also joined her in the madness at some point.) she feels like the years have passed her by. she wants to be young again and misses being touched by howard (her husband). all the events in the film eventually brings them together, and also tears them apart.this film slowly builds up for most of the run time, which is good. for this type of film, you want that slow burn. too much action, too quickly would be overkill.i love how all the kills come in a relatively short amount of time. it's one right after another, in a span of what felt like 15-20 minutes. all the kills were really nice. my favorite death was the one in the pond, followed by the one in the barn. great stuff.the acting in this wasn't anything special. but then again, you don't watch something like this and expect oscar worthy performances.i don't know how to describe it. this movie has a certain charm to it. most of my ""review"" feels like random thoughts cause i'm at a loss for words.it's a great time, great watch, tons of fun. watch this, especially after watching pearl.this gets a lennyreviewz score of: 8/10.",8
"236","x"," x goin' give it to ya","solojere",2022-03-23,"to quote the late great dnx (rip) ""x gonna give it to ya."" x is set in 1979 rural texas where a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast finds themselves fighting for their lives. spoiler warnings as there is a lot to break down here.x is one of the craziest films i have ever watched, but it's actually a lot deeper than your normal horror/ slasher film. i was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and i actually left the theater blown away, not sure fully what to think about what i had just watched. now usually, i'm not a horror fan, and to be honest, i only watched this movie because brittany snow is in it. i'm one of her biggest fans, and i was worried when i heard she was going to be in this and that she was going to be naked. but i have to say she totally killed it, and she steals every scene she is in. she alone makes the film worth seeing. brittany snow plays bobby-lynne, an adult film star who is setting out to mark on the world opposite kid cudi and mia goth. kid cudi's, mia goth's, and jenna ortega's characters are likable too, just not as much as brittany's. however, there is more depth to bobby-lynne than meets the eye. she is sexy, funny, smart, and near the end, even kind-hearted. also, the scene where she sings landslide is simply beautiful. her voice is so amazing, and the way it is cut with the old lady broke my heart. it literally almost made me cry. i wish we would've seen more of her character. now there is the fact that brittany snow is naked in this movie. there is a lot of nudity in x, which is why it isn't for everyone and probably isn't' a movie to watch with mom and dad. but for the most part, the nudity is more artistic than it is just for the sake of nudity. and, like it or not, it is part of the plot and the film's larger themes. it was strange to see brittany snow, someone i consider a personal hero, naked. but as i look at it, this is a job to her and that she consented to do it. no one forced her to, and she got paid for it. also, it didn't feel dirty or crude, and from her interviews, it sounds like they did everything they could to make her feel comfortable. honestly, she looks amazing, and it was as tasteful as it could be (kid cudi is a lucky man). but like i said, that is just a small part of much greater performance. and while i don't think it is her best performance ever, it is amazing. and i love that people are finally giving her the praise i feel like she has deserved for a long time now. my only complaints would be that she should've been the main star and that she shouldn't have died. i was secretly hoping that she would end up being the hero, but they had to kill her off. if she did have to go, getting eaten by an alligator is pretty bad a**. however, i feel like it is kind of getting old in these movies where everyone dies except one person, and you can figure out who that person is in the first five minutes. i know that this was meant to be a throwback to the 80s slasher films, but they could've changed it up a bit.i would also almost argue that it is more grotesque than horror. yeah, there are some scary or tense moments, but overall i felt that it was more going for shock. as far as violence goes, for the most part, there is nothing worse than your average episode of the walking dead. the only death i felt might have been a bit too much was the first one. where it gets weird is the nudity and the old people sex stuff. on the one hand, i enjoyed that this film wasn't about two old religious people trying to punish people they deemed as sinners, which i feel has been done to death. but on the other hand, i never really got the old people's motivation. i mean, i get it that the old lady wants to feel beautiful and still has needs, and her husband can't get it up, or he'll die. so, i get her motivation, but why is he doing this? he's sad he can't get it up anymore? also, i still don't know what they were going to do to mia goth. lastly, i feel like the film became a bit cliche once they started killing off characters. i get that you need some cliches here and there, but i could see almost every death coming from a mile away. however, i will say that this film is more about its characters than the violence. hence why i would label it grotesque.overall i give it an 8.5 out of 10
minus one star for killing off brittany's character and a half star for the character's deaths being too cliche and predictable. bonus points for naked brittany.it is a stunning smark, sexy, funny, and f**** up film, and if you have the stomach for it, i would highly recommend it for brittany snow alone.",8

"242","x"," i will not accept a life i don't deserve.","hey_sweden",2023-10-15,"""x"" is another solid exploitation-horror rehash from writer-director-editor ti west; taking place in rural texas in late '79, it follows a group of pornographers. intending to make their own adult film, they rent a guest house from a very aged farmer (stephen ure) and his fragile wife pearl. eventually, this conservative old couple cotton on to what the youngsters are doing, and set out to punish them - i mean really punish them.shot through with ominous atmosphere almost right from the start, this actually has more on its mind than just titillation and visceral horror. rather, it's pretty poignant when it makes the viewer think about the effects of ageing, and one can take some pity on this long-married man & wife. it also obliges the viewer to think about peoples' perceived notions of sex & sexuality.but west doesn't skimp on other aspects. his typically slow & measured pacing works well, and this does get positively creepy and twisted at times. the gore is quite effective, although there may not be enough sex & nudity for some viewers, given the nature of the film-within-the-film. west also takes the time to subvert at least one expectation.the cast gives it 100%, with mia goth proving to be particularly watchable in what is a dual role. jenna ortega, brittany snow, kid cudi (also an executive producer), martin henderson, owen campbell, and ure are all good in support. while you never believe that the actors playing howard & pearl are nearly as old as they're playing, they give memorably striking performances.i also enjoyed the little twist west throws in right at the end, and the soundtrack full of appropriate needle drops.followed very soon after by the prequel ""pearl"".seven out of 10.",7

"248","x"," an elderly couple escapes from an egyptian tomb, then...","fedor8",2023-04-14,"i have no idea how - once again - one of these mindless slasher films (or in this case ""hillbilly killer"" films) made it on my watch-list. usually i root those out while searching for horror films. i have a strict ""no-thrillers - only supernatural horrors"" rule, but every once in a while i get sloppy in my detective work and one of these crappolas ends up on my screen. the bad part is that by the time i realize this, the movie is already one-third over, so then i feel obliged to finish it, which is of course a monumental waste of time with practically all thrillers... with the usual risk of (even more) brain-damage.though with the help of the fast-forward button, naturally. i pretty much skipped/skimmed through a third of the movie, all of it in the 2nd half. once i realized that the idiotic premise involved murderers who were an ancient couple that looked like they'd escaped an egyptian tomb, i lost all interest. that kind of stuff is geared toward different demographics, those who welcome brain-damage with open arms. it's not for me. any time murderers are dumb-yet-uncatchable, or little children, or ancient couples, or farm animals, i try to avoid it. i have no time for such junk. one needs barely functioning grey cells to get into that kind of malarkey, which is why the thriller genre is the most peanut-brained film genre of them all.it's not all bad though. the first half-hour has positive things about it.the photography is good: because the plot takes place in the late 70s there are actual colors i.e. this isn't a stereotypical bleak-looking 21st-century grey-o-rama piece of junk.the set-up is ok: a crew of decadent buffoons go to shoot a po$$ographic film. better still, they don't behave like utter clowns, at least not often, and they are not the usual teen cretins, but vary in age, though the women appear to be in their twenties. there is a sense of mystery in this section, which of course turns out to be just a ruse for the movie to eventually dive into stupid-slasher mode.speaking of diving, there's an interesting scene with mia in the lake, early on. the aerial camera angle works very well. she resembles the young shelley duvall, though i doubt anyone noticed.however, the old couple is just ridiculous, total overkill. extreme make-up was used to make them look as if they were 250 years old, literally like bowman in the final scenes of ""2001: a space odyssey"". not only do they look too repulsive, they also lack realism, completely. it's ""texas chainsaw"" 1974 all over again but with far less style and mood.the premise of a murderous old couple isn't even that original: i came across it a few years ago in an even dumber uk film, in which the young people (burglars) get owned and killed by an old couple who look like they couldn't sit through a round of bingo much less kill and mutilate. and didn't m night charlatan also do a thriller about old killers on a farm recently? hating on old people and farmers at the same time: two despised, non-hip demographics swatted with one fell swoop. perhaps it's a new genre invented by can$el-culture millennials who hate all generations older than xers because they aren't pc enough for them? it's not as if i hadn't noticed that old movies barely get played on cable anymore, and by that i mean anything older than the 90s, which isn't even that old to begin with...believe me, in just a decade nearly all films made before the 90s will be banned by these new kids, except those that deal with gay rights and ra$ial issues in an ""acceptably ko$her"" manner. already now it's become very rare to come across movies from the 70s and 80s, let alone from the 40s or 50s. wasn't ""gone with the wind"" banned in some u. s. states because some snowy flakes deemed it ""raci$t""?soon all history will be ""erased"", newly re-written and all ""old non-progressive cultures"" will be swept under the rug, deemed too ""offensive"" and ""vile"" for the pre-orwellian pc plankton. perhaps these plankton will force everyone to shave their heads too, and burn dvds in large bonfires, and then we'll have ""1984"" right in the middle of the 21st century.so yes, this might be a new thriller sub-genre, old people being evil serial-killers, despite the fact that such a premise is too daft on so many levels. you can only do a comedy based on this, not a thriller.the old woman fondling blondes adds even more unnecessary nastiness to an already decrepit story, and the big showdown has the usual nonsense. there are some good touches in the grand finale, but the conversations between mia goth (the very predictable generic ""heroine""/sole-survivor) and the old hag are beyond stupid, completely unrealistic and downright bizarre. mia actually debating with the murderer is laughable. her character actually finds the time and interest to debate her future as an actress with these killers, amidst all the bloody chaos. ti west, clearly, just doesn't give a damn. he fits this era hence like a glove.there's even a prequel to this nonsense, which nepotist mia actually co-wrote so you can imagine how bad it must be. would you trust a nepotist - who actually married shia lebouf - to write anything halfway clever or usable? suddenly everyone's a writer and a director. will she publish her thesis on bigfoot next? will her novels be studied in schools?there is a bigger chance that rob zombie usurps kubrick as best director ever than mia writing a usable script. there is a bigger chance of rob zombie solving the middle east conflict than mia co-writing a good movie.",NA

'x' - the 2022 film from director ti west - is a horror film set during the filming of a pornographic film in 1979. ti west manages - in my opinion - to make a smart and surprisingly nostalgic film about the era in which the story takes place and about the low-cost cinema industry of those times, but at the same time he makes a shasher that will also satisfy the fans of this cinematographic genre. true, they have to wait until almost halfway through the film, when the action really kicks in and the blood starts flowing, but what happens from here on out will fully satisfy their expectations. quality nostalgic film and extreme horror rarely meet and work together, but here we are dealing with one of those cases.the film has eight characters. six of them are the members of a film team looking for a low-cost location for the filming of an adult movie and find it in an unused building on a farm in the vastness of texas, owned by an old couple with an unsettling physiognomy and with a rather hostile behavior, which should accentuate the doubts of young people. as in most genre films, the audience is much more aware of the dangers than the protagonists. the members of the filming team - an avant-garde director looking for work at any cost, his girlfriend - a nice and shy girl, at least at first -, two actresses and a porn actor and the producer - enthusiastically launch into filming, without paying attention to the effect that their behavior has on the elderly. indifference will cost them.ti west faced a challenge: making a film about low-cost cinema with low-cost means, but which doesn't look low-cost. i think that he was well inspired and cinematographically succeeded in a big way. first of all, he chose his actors very well - seven actors for eight roles, because yes - there is a double role that surprises most of the viewers, i think, as it surprised me. the visuals are excellent and the dual use of high-dive footage creates remarkable effects. alternating between screen formats, west switches cinematic styles between those practiced in 1979 and 2022. the soundtrack offers a veritable anthology of the music that any youngster knew and loved in the 70s. a word of warning, though. there will be viewers who will not like everything that can be seen on the screen in this movie. those who avoid gory horror films will do well to avoid 'x', and so should do those who can't stand nudity or sex in movies. these didn't bother me, i consider them part of the cinematic convention. instead i felt less comfortable with turning old age into a source of horror. i find it problematic, but maybe i should also see the 'prequel' ('pearl') - released six months after this film, also directed by ti west and co-written with the excellent actress mia goth who appears in both films - in order to have a complete perspective. rumors go that a sequel is in making, so 'x' has a chance to become a new series of horror films, but - i hope - not an ordinary one. with all the reservations and questions raised by this movie, i will watch it.",7
"252","x"," decent slasher film!!","dannylee-78082",2022-04-20,"to preface this review, i haven't watched a lot of horror movies - i only know of texas chainsaw massacre because i watched a shortened version of it on youtube. and ""x"" is supposed to be a homage to that movie. i am disappointed that i couldn't fully appreciate the connection due to my lack of knowledge, but the homage was pretty obvious, even to a noob like me.""x"" to me was a 7. it felt like a well-made horror/thriller/slasher film.in the beginning, we see a bunch of young people head to a rural farmhouse (equivalent to an airbnb of the 70s) to shoot an ""avant-garde"" pornographic video, under the leadership of a middle aged director. the names are hardly important. the movie starts with pretty good buildup with very subtle, but great foreshadowing (e.g. the black ""cock"", unloaded gun, dead cow, super religious broadcast). when the movie was half shoot, most people except one, maxine, are slain by the elderly owners of the farmhouse.the structure of the movie was divided into two parts: pre-shooting and post-shooting. most of the killings occur in the night after the shooting. it mostly filled the horror part pretty well. i was pretty spooked for the latter half of the film mostly because pearl (the old lady) was just such a spooky character and the setting was really appropriate. the prosthetics on the old couple made them look very very old on purpose to make them more villainous. couple jump-scares were pretty effective, but not all. i loved that the movie had an intricate dichotomy between porn and horror (though the porn part was short). fear and sex are basically two sides of the same coin so i thought it was an interesting writing choice. also want to add that i noticed that there were some great music and sounds that incorporated moaning sounds fittingly.there were some amazing cinematography weaved into the film. my personal favorite was the shot where pearl gets increasingly red as the blood from her victim splashes onto the headlight of the car. incredible shot and added dramatic effect because she was wearing a white dress. and i had no idea that this was a dual role performance by mia goth. prosthetics were incredible that i completely didn't even realize it. what a phenomenal performance.unlike typical slasher movies, we actually have moments where the audience could experience the depth of their emotion. pearl could not let go of her past beauty and had the desire to be wanted and reaffirmed. howard was her husband who seemingly cannot fulfill her desires because of his health. the murders actually had somewhat of a basis because a bunch of young people filming porn is a portrayal of what they want but can't have especially given the religious context, hence causing the rage. however, i do want to point out that this was their repeat offense based on the sunken car and the hung missing person and i am hearing that we will be getting a prequel as well to explain their past more.the movie actually brings an interesting topic - sex at old age. old people still have sex but it almost feels even more taboo talking about it. age is something that everyone has to experience and yet it feels incredibly disturbing to even observe elderly sex on screen because we are just so not used to it. sex is a beautiful act among all ages and one should be able to accept that or i think they become monsters like pearl and howard, albeit less violent.all in all, ""x"" was a pleasant surprise, packed with classic slasher vibes along with interesting topic selection.",7

(yeah ... unlike the group of maladjusted psychopaths that made this film.)fourth, every one of the main characters is despicable. i couldn't sympathize with any of these degenerate losers who left the city to bring their moral depravity to the rural environs. in fact, not only could i not sympathize with them, i hated every one of them and couldn't wait for them to die. but, back to point number two, it takes way too long for the meaningless gore of each of their deaths.oh, and here's a bonus reason to hate it: it costars jenna ortega as a ""nice girl"" who didn't like porn, but after seeing it wants to star in it too. i certainly won't view jenna's portrayal of the wednesday addams character with the same light-hearted comedic affection ever again.what utter garbage of a film, and with zero redeeming qualities! don't waste your time.",1

'x' doesn't always find the right words to say something profound. it's more of a slasher than an elevated slasher but it is goth that does the elevating.i'd also like to commend the ensemble. this is an extremely well cast film. we all know the complaint about horror films like this that the cast is meant solely to die. that isn't the case here. every member of our slasher troop is likable and has something of a dramatic arc. i especially liked the juxtaposition between the motivations of martin henderson's wayne and. jenna ortega's lorraine. we understand the nuisances the characters have about sex. it's a movie about smut but none of the characters are shown to deserve death because of some higher morals. in a way 'x' is kind of progressive in the face of some of the uglier ways horror has looked at sexuality.so, yes i would say 'x' is a special horror film that breaths life into the slasher film and lays foundations for new life. after 'halloween kills', netflix's 'texas chainsaw', and 'scream' 'x' is a treat.",8

""what happened to action movies?""
i have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. if you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. not only is everything cgi like any of the action films netflix churns out by the week. the badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. every time. now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. but this is the whole movie. i could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. and i'm not at the edge of my seat when i see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. hell, even the cat is cg ninety-nine percent of the time. i saw this on regular imax but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' i got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3d to make an extra buck. the schtick with cross-cutting henry cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.i must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a french comedy film (la ch√®vre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'the long kiss goodnight' (1996) rip-off. but the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. and they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: the actors.i don't want to talk too much about bryce dallas howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. she is a obviously corpulent, which i thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. it makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. but the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but i guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, bradley james allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in vaug's films. more unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like sam rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. i don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. he is worse here than in seven psychopaths (2012). bryan cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, i really want to blame ai for this. scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. we have an exciting scene with sam jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own kingman film). i leave it at that. and want to end with another question. can we please get old school movies back?",3
"309","argylle"," matthew vaughan's spy-action-comedy is messy & illogical","samthebestest",2024-02-02,"argylle (2024) :
movie review :argylle review: spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. in its first half, argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. there are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard in my life,"" yells aidan, aka sam rockwell, and you are like, ""yes! then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" that's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from a to g to c to z to t to again back to b. that's how messy it is. too many twists make too much of a mess here.argylle is about a spy novelist, elly conway (bryce dallas howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, argylle (henry cavill). for the next book, she decides to visit her mother, ruth conway (catherine o'hara), to brew some new ideas. on the train, she meets a real agent, aidan (sam rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. elly constantly imagines argylle in place of aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. aidan informs elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. she is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka aidan, can get to it. but that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.the writing of argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. that's why you can carry on with it. the idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. the problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about elly, aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. from memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. that's too much. argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. can you imagine that?bryce dallas howard as elly conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after barbie. the idea and standard have both changed now. sam rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. the handsome agent, henry cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. but the role? let me change the subject. bryan cranston and catherine o'hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. ariana debose, dua lipa, john cena, and samuel jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while sofia boutella finds the best space amongst them. alfie, aka chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.on the technical front, argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. the cinematography was good, and the vfx work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. you gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. it was a new experience, despite its stupidity. we aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. argylle fails to understand where to stop. you just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. matthew vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. he could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. as a whole, vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.rating - 3/10*",3

"311","argylle"," stupid nonsense with a five minute henry cavill bond demo reel","chance_boudreaux19",2024-02-01,"argylle is a long, dumb, cgi-riddled mess. in other words, it's the standard modern day hollywood movie. some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. there is an abundance of cgi and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. i'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in london because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part i didn't care about what was happening at all. additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. they have you believe that henry cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. those five minutes prove that he would be a great james bond but i bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. additionally, john cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. the rest of the cast is fine and i like sam rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. on the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. i think think the pg-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it rated r would've helped it a bit.. if this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.",4
"312","argylle"," fur-tunately, this isn't a cat-astrophe. it was purr-fect for a movie released in february.","iamianiman",2024-01-31,"packed in a way that is engaging, argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. but as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. you will become more intrigued. your interest in the movie will be better. it will be anything beyond your expectations. they surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. what started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.there's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. they're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. they knew how to structure the story. it was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. we felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.however, the third act felt... a bit too much. the beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. it was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of kingsman. but came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than kingsman i would say. the tone just fell apart there. it became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'what happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. if only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.another thing that argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. it became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. if you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. this one, not so much.its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by bryce dallas howard & sam rockwell. these two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. bryce and sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. they are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. they don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.while a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. the character played by samuel jackson. his character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. it wasn't fleshed out enough. he barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? for a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.even dua lipa has more screen time than him! or so we thought according to our calculation. this movie markets dua lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. if you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. if only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.there's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. but knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the cgi looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.we also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. the first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. it plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. the transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. it's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.while the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. in our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. it doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. action is great but not 'wow' enough. comedy is there but was pretty bland. there just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. the only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.verdict: what argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. this kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. where argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. but then, matthew vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.",7

""argylle"" is an action film directed by matthew vaughn, featuring henry cavill as agent argylle and dua lipa as lagrange. they engage in a sultry dance before lagrange escapes under bullets. argylle, with the help of his team, escapes and chases lagrange down narrow streets in a set piece ripped from james bond. ""argylle"" is a film that fails to balance the seriousness of the story with the frivolity of its previous acts. the film's plot is dominated by a zany character, rockwell, who becomes a romantic lead. howard's performance also loses force as the backstory of elly crystallizes. the film's narrative drains, and the set piece, intended to be quirky and operatic, becomes the dreariest action scene. vaughn's attempt to warp fight choreography into overstretched plastic is overstretched and unstable. the film had the potential to be a clever parody, but it seems to get tired of being the butt of the joke before it can deliver the punchline. the film's attempt to connect with the kingsman franchise fails to deliver a satisfying experience. they exchange banal dialogue, with lagrange comparing argylle to a terrorist and argylle to a terrorist. the characters, created by elly conway, are created to resemble cardboard cutouts from a dime-store spy novel. the film is set in the fifth novel in the bestselling argylle series. jason fuchs' script follows elly, a writer struggling with writer's block, as she travels to visit her mother. she meets aidan, a believable spy, who blends into the background. the film uses pov shots from elly's eyes and an editing trick to blend rockwell's face with cavill's, blending reality with fiction. the film ""now and then"" features major stars like samuel l jackson, richard e. grant, and debose in thankless roles, with flat lighting and jagged action. the film's editing is choppier, with three bombastic plays of the beatles' ""now and then"" boosting the action. the use of john lennon's voice in the film is ghoulish, despite the likely cost of the song.",9

"319","argylle"," takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a matthew vaughn film for better and for worse","mrdhwong",2024-02-01,"""argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by matthew vaughn (""kick-ass"", ""x-men: first class"", the ""kingsman"" series). starring bryce dallas howard, sam rockwell, henry cavill, john cena, and bryan cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a matthew vaughn film for better and for worse.after concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy aubrey argylle (henry cavill), novelist elly conway (bryce dallas howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. later, elly decides to visit her mother (catherine o'hara) by travelling on a train where she meets aidan (sam rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""division"". with her life now in serious danger, elly is taken by aidan to london where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the division for good. along the way, elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that aidan is not everything he says he is.it can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. matthew vaughn's latest film ""argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.by now, anybody who has watched most of matthew vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. in the opening scene in a greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident james bond-esque spy argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (dua lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author elly conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. from this point on, the film shows elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.once elly meets aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with elly's shocked reactions to the real spy aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. while some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, i found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. for instance, in one scene aidan teaches elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. what then follows is a scene where the meek elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. in any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. this could be because i've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in vaughn's own ""kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. if there were one thing matthew vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. there were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in elly's imagination and aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. here, vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.as the lead of this film, i really enjoyed watching bryce dallas howard take on a role like elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. though elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. i also liked watching her interact with sam rockwell as aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. rockwell and howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.despite only appearing in elly's imagination, it's fun to watch henry cavill play the role of a suave spy like aubrey argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on james bond. at this point, it's hard to say if cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. john cena was also amusing to see as wyatt, the man responsible for helping out argylle from a safer distance away from the action. whether or not this is an inside joke referencing cena's ""you can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but i thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. the rest of the cast, which includes bryan cranston, catherine o'hara, ariana debose, samuel l. jackson, and singer dua lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers i will not be discussing them here.although matthew vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. if the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, i would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in vaughn's ""kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. for that reason alone, i would be willing to call the film a minor success.i rate it 7/10.",7

"322","argylle"," argylle: a thrilling blend of spy adventure with a hint of familiarity","kayraurn",2024-02-10,"the first potential blockbuster of the year is the work of british director matthew vaughn, known for his kingsman trilogy and before that, movies like super-fine brit-thriller layer cake, youthful superhero movie kick-ass and grown-up superhero movie x-men: first class.working from a script by jason fuchs, argylle tells the tale of elly conway (bryce dallas howard), a successful writer of spy novels about a certain agent argylle. unfortunately, just when she is about to write the final chapter of her new book, she is suddenly hit by a severe case of writer's block.you may ask yourself: is this temporary or has she simply run out of stories to tell?but before you can come up with an answer, something strange happens and characters from her novels come to life right before her eyes. and before she knows it, elly becomes part of her own spy universe. the central question that remains is: who is the real agent argylle?this is basically all you need to know, because argylle is one of those movies where you probably have the most fun the less you know about it beforehand.the cast is great, by the way, and apart from bryce dallas howard, includes the likes of sam rockwell, henry cavill, john cena, bryan cranston, catherine o'hara, samuel l. jackson, sofia boutella, ariana debose and dua lipa. but for the same reason i mentioned earlier i'm not gonna talk about the characters, either.the movie looks like 100 million bucks it actually cost 200 million!) and vaughn keeps the movie on track, at least most of the time, with its lively mix of big action sequences, (un)predictable twists and turns, and comic interludes. oh, and there is a cat too, as elly always travels with her cat alfie in a special cat pack. alfie gets the chance to scratch someone's eyes out, cause, you know, cats are wild animals. (alfie's owner in real life, by the way, is supermodel claudia schiffer).as i said, it's a fun ride, but i do have some nits to pick. the movie takes a while to get going and the final part of this 140 minute movie is way to drawn out.the set-up of a writer with writer's block is reminiscent of both last year's the lost city and there are also overtones of the earlier romancing the stone. early on in argylle there is a sequence on a train that feels like a replay of the brad pitt movie bullet train. i know there are lots of movies featuring action scenes on trains, but this one feels very similar.still, these are relatively minor problems.there is also a reveal halfway through the movie that seems lifted from well-known action classic the long kiss goodnight (1996), which also included samuel l. jackson in its cast. now, i'm not saying there have never reveals like that in other movies or series, but this particular one (including a change in hair style) flies way to close to the sun to be considered a creative liberty.so my conclusion is that for a movie that clearly wants to add something fresh to the 007-kind of spy genre, or at least subvert some of its most well-worn tropes, argylle relies way too much on previous spy movies.and there is something else as well: i probably love the beatles more than you, but the fact that the recently released now and then is used not once, not twice but three times almost in full to emphasize certain story elements, that obviously have to do with the mixing of past and present, is a bit much.matthew vaughn has indicated that he wants to blend argylle and it's sequel, the kingsman movies and an as yet unnamed new spy franchise into a new cinematic universe.that too feels like a bit (too) much.note: argylle is released this week in most parts of the world, with south-korea, china and japan to follow in the coming weeks.",6
"323","argylle"," funny, enjoyable spy spoof","danusha_goska",2024-02-04,"""argyle"" is a funny, silly, spy spoof. it mocks the conventions of bond movies. the plot is completely implausible but it all hangs together, kinda sorta. it involves, of course, international spy conspiracies and lots and lots of twists and turns in exotic locales like london and the south of france.bryce dallas howard manages to play a range of personas of a very complicated character. sam rockwell is just adorable as a laid back, super confident, super competent spy. he's surprisingly sexy and romantic. rockwell is not tall and he's not particularly muscular and he's not super handsome. he radiates scruffy, average guy sexiness in contrast to the tall, muscular, freakishly handsome sexiness of the divine henry cavill.catherine o'hara, bryan cranston, samuel l jackson, and john cena are all really good as ... well, i can't tell you what they play because that would spoil the outlandish bond-ish plot. richard grant and ariana debose are in the movie only briefly but they are of course wonderful.""argyle"" is violent without being bloody or gory. anonymous hitman are killed and the body count is high, but you don't see any blood. there are martial arts fight scenes. again, this is a spoof and the violence in these scenes is superficial, but yes, there is a lot of shooting. there's a wild shootout scene involving ice skating on a highly unexpected surface - it's not ice. i expected the skater to perform ""the iron lotus"" from ""blades of glory.""if you are in the mood for pure escapist fare that lets you turn off your brain and you just want to watch stars do their stuff and watch exotic locales and a lead couple with good romantic chemistry, ""argyle"" might be just for you.",7

"325","argylle"," what a hoot..","nindave-movies",2024-02-07,"firstly ignore the critic's, they really need to chill out sometimes.. argylle is a fun packed, totally silly movie. just sit back, don't have preconceptions, and enjoy what is a entertaining film. sam rockwell partnership with bryce dallas howard works brilliantly, creating some fabulous funny moments in the film. the whole cast interact their character roles brilliantly with each other creating a comic strip world that revolves around kingsman narrative. yes, you could make a case to criticise too much cgi or script isn't hitting the mark, but i want to watch a film and escape the depressing state of the world, i left the cinema having had a great laugh ",8
"326","argylle"," ""like watching a boat full of leaks, sink...""","katherinedevere",2024-02-04,"taking my seat, i had my fingers crossed that director matthew vaughn (kingsman,) had resurrected his career with a romping good spy story, set against a cracking soundtrack with some great actors.the opening, with a red-hot dua lupa and henry cavil was upbeat, but alas! from the sight of cavill's haircut onwards, it was all downhill.the story introduces the pudgy best-selling spy writer, elly conway, played by bryce dallas howard, (daughter of director, ron howard). presented both as an author and later as a special agent, howard's performance scores low on credibility and high on irritability. unfortunately, she doesn't have the charisma or range to carry the part, but is it all her fault?almost from the opening we're served up the thinnest of premises, that somehow elly's published novels are 'predictive' and so she's become a target for the secret service. thus her 'real' life intersects with her fiction - throw in a pet cat and you have a winner, right? wrong! (the cat-gags might be a high point, but like the film even they wear thin.)
there was a great opportunity here, to contrast the difference between elly's romanticised fiction and the gritty reality of the spy-world. but there's the problem, by glamming elly up, and adding in all the 'movie/fiction' spy-effects the story doesn't work. with another director and script this might have been movie gold.henry cavill as elly's fictional character and foil, agent argylle, and the film's namesake, runs himself out of contention for any bond films. his performance is more wooden than pinocchio's - and like his haircut, awkward.as to the plot, it has more holes in it than cheese. scriptwriter, jason fuchs asks the viewer to suspend disbelief so many times that it becomes a lesson in idiocy.were they trying to parody the good-old super spy genre with a twist to every twist? unfortunately, the result is just plain dumb. for example, pudgy elly suddenly becomes a crack shot and hyper-fit operative, even though (according the story,) she's spent the last five years sitting on her arse, eating junk food and tapping out vapid novels.the film uses dance sequences as humour, but mostly they're crudely delivered - a bit like the oil scene, where killer elly, can suddenly ice-skate through it. (but hang on, wasn't the bit about her being an ice-skater just a memory-plant so how did she get the skills, physically speaking? yeah, that's right, most of us can execute a quadruple axel on a whim. and...fyi oil is not ice.)
spy, aiden wilde's character should be shot for the stupidity of his dialogue alone; although actor sam rockwell, does his best with the appalling material. one wonders what was anyone was thinking? if they were they thinking at all.just as in kingsman got the pace, soundtrack and acting just right, argylle is the opposite; the music's wrong, the pace is wrong, the acting is embarrassing and the plot is woeful. this was a bit like watching a boat full of leaks, sink - no expense spared and no cgi could save it.resisting the strong urge to leave, several times over, i sat this pointless misery out until i could bear no more. not even veteran actors richard e grant, bryan cranston and samuel l jackson could save this purported 200-million-dollar howler..
two hours and 19 minutes too long, it's not often that one resents the $35 dollars spent on a premium ticket, but if i could, i'd tap at the box office window and beg for my money back.rating: get a refund before you sit down.",1

"329","argylle"," a king's woman can't be a kingslayer","kluseba",2024-02-15,"do you know the difference between the movie argylle and the song kingslayer by bring me the horizon and babymetal? the former is tame, predictable and appealing while the latter is experimental, energetic and challenging. argylle tells the story of a spy novel author who is suddenly torn into genuine secret agent business upon being attacked by strangers on a train and helped by a mysterious protector who seems to know her very well. this movie mixes slapstick situation comedy with mild romance. it combines dynamic action scenes with tense thriller elements. the film tells its intriguing own story yet makes numerous connections to the king's man franchise.let's get the negative elements out of the way right from the start. this movie asks for a complete suspension of disbelief that goes even further than most fantasy and science-fiction movies in recent memory. that overwhelming element of constant exaggeration makes even the film's more serious scenes and tense sequences look inappropriately light-hearted and unintentionally funny. the connections with the king's man franchise diminish the qualities of this movie and uncomfortably push it into an exhausting bigger picture. especially the film's ending feels flawed and rushed in that regard just for the sake of promoting potential sequels.on the positive side, this quirky movie provides energetic entertainment from start to finish. the characters are complex, intriguing and profound. the acting performances are convincing with bryce dallas howard excelling as multi-faceted lead actress and samuel l. jackson oozing with charisma in his memorable role as former secret agency deputy director. the settings of this movie are particularly appealing and transition from the snow-covered rocky mountains of the united states of america to the urban density of london in england and sunny vineyards in southern france. the story comes around with multiple turns and twists, some being predictable while a few being genuine surprises. lighting, sound and special effects have been executed with an impressive budget and great care as they are best enjoyed on the big screen. the film's soundtrack finds a balanced mixture of well-known classics and a few new tunes.as you can read, argylle has a lot more positive elements to offer than nagging downsides. just be aware that this movie is connected to the king's man franchise and that you should be familiar with said film series in order to enjoy this feature to the fullest. furthermore, please understand that this movie is supposed to be the start of a trilogy and that watching this feature might make you feel obligated to view upcoming sequels as well. on its own however, argylle finds an excellent mixture of humorous tones and serious sequences that should appeal to a wide audience from curious teenagers to seasoned genre experts. this movie thus offers wonderful entertainment for the whole family.",7
"330","argylle"," sadly one of the most disappointing films of 2024","habibiehakim123",2024-02-02,"it's like mission impossible and james bond movies with a lot of cgi, besides that argylle also suffers from storytelling problem, it have an interesting concept but matthew vaughn execution was just poorly done, from the unnecessary long narration and at the end a writing problem with the film i felt there is just too much twist and weird characters decision, the thing that i most upset is how they use both henry cavill and john cena, they are two of the biggest star right now and they decided to give them a role that are just so wasted, you can't put these two exciting actors in a movie that also star studded but somehow they are more interesting actor and they only in the film in total of 5 minutes in a 139 minutes of film, and i'm sorry to say that the last 30 minutes of the film i just don't really care and it does getting dumber, now i don't hate the whole thing as there is a moment of we're finally in the pretty intriguing good stuff after the first confusing half of the film which are not completely bad but not the best, and there is also about 30 minutes of actually interestingly good stuff in argylle, performances wise overall i think sam rockwell carry the film as i think he was good in the film, the rest of the cast was ok, bryce dallas howard i must say she was mixed, sometimes she was ok but sometimes she can be terrible, the action sequences was not the most exciting but there is one particular action sequence near the end with this very interesting visual and i quite enjoy it, i really like the soundtrack especially how they use ""now and then"" by the beatles comes from beatlemania himself, goosebumps everytime, overall argylle was interesting in some of the concept, but mostly just poor executed in the writing and pacing, it is sadly one of the most disappointing films of 2024.",5

2) in amongst a sea of terrible acting and dialogue, i actually thought sam rockwell was great. he pulls off the action scenes really well, he's funny, and in the second half of the film when he has to play someone grappling with the love of his life not remembering him, i felt he was very believable. in fact, him and bryce dallas howard had great chemistry and the emotional scene in the car driving to france was actually quite emotionally engaging
3) nobody does fight scenes with pop songs in the background quite like mathew vaughn. it's basically his signature at this point and there are some fun fight scenes herenegatives:1) for a film with a $200m budget, it felt so badly made. the direction, visuals, sound etc were all painfully bad. i can't believe all these a list actors were able to make it through how bad the writing is, although the insane amount of money apple spent on this film probably helped
2) you can get away with 1 or 2 twists in a film, but the second half of this film has 6 or 7 twists and it made me roll my eyes so much. it's not clever, it's just exhausting
3) the film is ridiculously long. i swear on my life, when i thought the film was approaching its final act i checked my watch and we were only an hour in, out of a 2hour 20minute movie. it overstays its welcome so much and it was then outrageous to give us one of the worst credits scenes i have ever seen. they clearly thought this was going to be a hit by teasing a sequel but after the terrible reviews and terrible box office i can guarantee that sequel will never get made.",5
"351","argylle"," what did i just watch...","sinscopefilms",2024-02-11,"the first impression:the film kicks off on a confusing note, leaving me scratching my head. yet, as we dive deeper, the cinematography shines through. the transition from medium shots to drone footage, paired with the protagonist's pov shots, actor's medium-long shots, offers a captivating glimpse into her world.the positive:right off the bat, the funky music in ""argyle"" caught my attention. the musical soundtrack, with its ability to build tension at times, stands out as the film's strongest feature. it has this vibe that just hooks you in. the soundtrack fits well with the film's overall vibe, although it doesn't introduce any innovative elements. moreover, the editing is sharp and on point, and the sound design is well-mixed.the negative:when it comes to the narrative and visual storytelling, ""argyle"" hits a rough patch. the potential is there, but the execution feels super average, hampered further by some notably faulty acting. at times, the film's scenes were so bizarrely executed that they left me in stitches, not sure whether to be amused or bemused.however, when it comes to clothing design, things get a bit mixed. dua lipa's outfit? spot-on and stylish. however, not all that glitters is gold. the costume design for the rest of the argylle characters felt underwhelming for a spy film, too modest to match the genre's flair. i rate it as 2 out of 10.the mixed:the locations and production design were pleasing but nothing extraordinary. and then there's the cat - cute, but the cgi moments felt disturbing and inconsistent, pulling me out of the experience.the car chase scene, heavy on cgi and bordering on the absurd, had me wondering if i'd accidentally wandered into a parody / comedy rather than a spy thriller. and speaking of parodies, the film's tone is all over the place. initially, it feels like a non-serious, laugh-out-loud spy parody. but then, the second half takes a sharp turn into a more serious exploration of ellie's past, which, surprisingly, turned out to be somewhat watchable.despite these rollercoaster highs and lows, the film drags on for too long, testing my patience to the point of almost giving up on it. the use of color and black-and-white scenes, however, was a clever touch, seamlessly woven into the film's fabric.the conclusion:in conclusion, ""argyle"" is a mixed bag. its unique style and moments of unexpected humor might make it a guilty pleasure for some. yet, overall, it's a tasteless affair that left me disappointed. my verdict? a middling 5 out of 10.",5

(loved sam rockwell!) there are so many twists and turns, most of which are somewhat predictable, but still managed to be fun. i just wish the reveal of who the real agent argylle is wasn't spoiled for me by a 3-year-old tweet announcing the production of the movie!so did i like it? yes. did i think it was terrible and really dumb at times? also yes.sorry... guess i'm not much help for this one!oh, also, can matthew vaughn please make kingsman 3 already??",7

"398","argylle"," too long, boring and generic","dello_",2024-02-05,"the root of all the issues of ""argylle"" is the length. indeed ""argylle"" is by nature a stupid film that can be funny only for a certain amount of time and then it becomes boring. indeed the plot is simple by itself and cutting 30 minutes would have been beneficial. in particular, the last part of the film is a sequence of plot twists coming out of nowhere (they were not built and so they don't feel earned) which are made possibile thanks to a series of plot conveniences. knowing what type of movie ""argylle"" is, it's celar that a certain amount of them are justified and they can be accepted but after a certain point not so much. furthermore the cgi is pretty bad in few instances with very visible green screens and the 30 minutes less would have helped focusing better on that aspect too.i was expecting ""argylle"" to be funny, with great action scenes and good jokes but unfortunately it was only generic and the length didn't help. a movie that i tend to associate with ""argylle"" is ""bullet train"" with brad pitt because the general idea is the same: a funny, stupid and kinetic spy movie that has the only scope of entertain. the difference between the two is that ""bullet train"" is shorter, more coherent and shot better thus achieving a great sense of fun. on the other hand ""argylle"" is too chaotic. in particular i was enjoying the movie till the big twist on the bryce dallas howard character. indeed i think the movie on one hand loses its originality and it goes to a pretty generic plot seen many times and on the other hand it introduces a whole new situation thus further extending the runtime.in the end i found ""argylle"" fun at the beginning but progressively boring and boring with a series of criminal sequences in the third act that really pushed me more and more outside of the atmosphere (i'll cite only the two worst: the skating scene and the pipe in the head). personally i wouldn't suggest it and i am disappointed because i was hoping to see a stupid but fun spy movie. in any case if you know you generally like this kind of movies i suggest you to try it out because there is the potential to appreciate something if you are able to pass on some issues.",4

"406","argylle"," when you order james bond from wish","tomtalksfilms",2024-02-04,"argylle is a newly released spy/thriller directed by matthew vaughn of kingsman fame. bryce dallas howard stars as the main protagonist ellie conway who is a fictionally acclaimed author of a series of spy novels. whilst trying to finish the final chapter of her fifth novel she is interrupted by sam rockwells character aidan, a stranger who informs her that the events portrayed in her books have actually taken place. as a result she must now work to finish the fifth book whilst being pursued by the 'the organisation' who are the villains of her own books in order to save her own life.this film has been largely panned by critics and for the first ninety minuets of its two hours and twenty minute run time i was unsure as to why. there seemed to be an interesting story building around this writer and what is and isn't the reality of the situation. i found the film to be most interesting in the brief time that ellie is unsure whether to trust aidan as that's where the tension really held up well.quite early on into the second half of the however i felt the film showed its cards too early. we quickly start to learn more about the reality of the situation and the more i found out the more that tension evaporated until quite quickly all that was left to be enjoyed about the film was the action sequences.the action sequences themselves are pretty much what you would expect from the director of kingsman. very stylised and over the top and yet with no blood as of course they had to get that pg-13 rating. the difference between this and kingsman though is that this film really goes balls to the wall with the action sequences, dare i say borderline fast and furious levels of bs at times. this took all the grittiness that makes action sequences enjoyable away and drew my attention towards the shoddy cgi work even more.one thing this film did do a good job of though was its marketing. clearly a lot of money was put into it as the trailer for this film was everywhere and if you've ever seen a film before in your life then i'm sure you've had it recommended to you somewhere online. the trailer and the poster for that matter make it look like henry cavill is the protagonist however that's very much not the case. he's completely wasted to be honest so avoid this one if he was one of the big selling points of this film for you.props to the marketing team for a great exercise in misleading cinema goers.overall i can't help but feel this was a concept with a lot of potential most of which was wasted by the end of the film. perhaps a different writer and director could have done a better job.",6

"410","argylle"," the acting and the action save argylle from completely careening off the cliff","canpatbuck3664",2024-02-03,"i won't beat around the bush when i'm discussing what didn't work in argylle but i would feel remiss if i also didn't credit what worked in this mixed bag of a movie. the first obvious positive is the cast, there's some serious wattage from their collective star power. starting with our lead bryce dallas howard, i think she did about as good of a job as could reasonably be expected. she's certainly done no favours by the script, her character's motivations and personality shift on a dime (sometimes from scene to scene). she does what she can in the action, she gets a few laughs as the smart yet dowdy ellie conway and she has some palpable chemistry with her primary co-star. henry cavill's is well cast as the stoic yet fully capable agent argylle. i like watching cavill in action movies period, he's got the physicality for the stunts/choreography and the talent to bring some personality to the characters he plays. he's appropriately suave here and it looks like he's having fun. i actually wish we had gotten even more time with this character. i want to tip my hat to bryan cranston and catherine o'hara respectively. they're both in roles which would have been easy to phone in, the angry spy chief and the supportive but out-of-touch mother. but bryan brought some intensity/gravitas as director ritter and catherine was funny even though her character is s cliche. as much as i really liked the entire cast, there was one performance that stood out among the rest. sam rockwell is a fantastic talent even on his worst day but he was awesome as aidan wilde. he has an effortless charm and a seemingly easy but deceptively sharp comic delivery that mesh so perfectly with his secret agent character. even when argylle was about to collapse, his shared chemistry with howard helped keep the movie above water. i'd love to offer further comments on samuel l. jackson and john cena as alfie and wyatt but they're in the movie so briefly, i feel like i can't grade them accurately. i did also want to congratulate dua lipa, she also doesn't have much screen time but she nailed the seductive and dangerous vibe of her character lagrange. i'd like to see her in a james bond-esque movie in a similar style of role, i was very impressed.the other clear standout aspect is matthew vaughn's filming style for the action scenes. he and his crew know how to bring a sense of danger (through the choreography and the editing) to punch up what could be rote. i did wish that argylle would have gone full kingsman and done it with an r rating but argylle still had it's moments even if it was a little more subdued. my favourite was the scene on the train but vaughn and his crew's fingerprints are all over all the action bits and they fit the bill for what the genre requires.i try to form my own opinions about the movies i watch, the critics can be right or wrong depending on the movie and the viewpoint. but i have to admit, when it comes to argylle's missteps, the group of them more or less nailed it. people have been quick to point the finger at matthew vaughn for argylle's messy plot and pacing (he should at least share the blame but he's not the sole offender) but i want to point out writer jason fuch's screenplay for fumbling the story repeatedly. argylle can't make up its mind on where to stop twisting the story, this might seem like nit-picking but watch the movie, i guarantee you'll be shocked at how many times plot twists feature. agent argylle seems like a real person part of the time but then in the next scene, he's a figment of ellie's imagination. there's some badly needed clarity to what is actually going on, especially later in the film. it was just shift after shift and while i normally like a good plot twist, by attempt #5 i was just groaning in my seat or quietly yet still saying wtf out loud. i think the plausibility goes out the window early and just never comes back and as much as argylle isn't supposed to be realistic, the creative team needs to put enough effort in so i don't disconnect from the movie completely. the long run time compounds this problem, you could have shaved about 30 minutes off this movie without losing anything relevant to the plot. the decision to keep so much in just adds to the movie's pacing problems and it made me yearn for matthew vaughn's better previous works. i also couldn't help but feel a little cheated as half of the cast that feature in the poster have so little to do in the movie that it almost felt like false advertising.i so badly wanted argylle to be good. i love some of vaughn's previous work (i adore the original kingsman and x-men: first class is my favourite x-men movie). but argylle is at best a mixed bag with some redeeming qualities that are outweighed by some baffling choices in the screenplay and an unfocused story. if you take matthew vaughn's flair out of the movie (the movie does have cool locales, costumes, set dressing and some good looking cgi), there's so little left here minus the cast. i'm going to have to reluctantly give argylle a 6/10 and i do feel like i could have graded it much more shrewdly. i still enjoyed argylle and i would recommend it if you enjoy spy movies and frenetic action but the overall appeal isn't going to transcend like vaughn's kingsman franchise. turn your brain off and keep expectations low, argylle may work for you better than first thought.",6

the direction on a microscale makes no sense as it does not feel like the movie is going anywhere with its interpersonal scenes; the direction of actors is fine mainly because everyone in the cast is an experienced actor (so it makes me believe that no one was actually taking his direction); the storytelling is terrible as the movie constantly tries to go back and forth from with this first person pov where the protagonist is living out the stories she is creating, but then all of a sudden, this gets dropped at the halfway point of the point for their 'big twist'; the tension is not built at all as none of the scenes flow to build tension (all the action scenes just happen in a second)), decent acting (decent from henry cavill (really is just sauve eye-candy; side note, but i feel bad for henry cavill because he's a decent actor but is just always in bad projects), decent to pretty good from bryce dallas howard (does a fine job, but it just honestly feels like she's not right for this character), pretty good from sam rockwell (the only performance with any positive outcome on the movie as his charm and humor make the movie somewhat bearable (mainly because he is just playing himself the whole time)), decent from bryan cranston (he's just playing himself as put no effort into the role), decent from catherine o'hara (really just pulled from her personality and acting experience), pretty bad from dua lipa (just eye candy who cannot help that she's not an actress), decent from ariana debose, decent from john cena, decent from samuel l. jackson (they really just wasted his talent in this movie because he's given the most boring character, even though he does a decent job in playing him), decent from the rest of the cast (everyone is just kinda there or are truly just background characters)), very bad story (the concept is incredibly stupid as it feels like it was created by a five-year-old (especially as the movie drags out); the plot structure is terrible because the plot just constantly unravels into an uncontrollable mess that cannot be stopped, and they could have cut 30 mins of fluff and the movie still wouldn't have made any sense); the flow between sequences is practically non-existent because the plot just kept on going in an opposite direction that none of what is going on screen made any sense; the character writing is terrible because they just try to force so much into these characters that they just end up having no personalities or struggles that you care for), very bad screenplay (the dialogue is very bad because there are moments where it is intentionally bad (mimicking the 'argylle' book), but the rest is still very bad because it is written as if it is a parody of a parody of a spy movie (and this is evident when they 'overload the mainframe' by typing for 5 seconds); the humor is very bad because it tries to make you laugh so many times, but i laughed maybe like once; the symbolism is just inferred as they didn't write these characters deep enough to where you care how they're affected by what's going on; the foreshadowing is practically non-existent as the movie constantly tries to subvert your expectations to the point that it subverts any ounce of realism), bad score (just forced and feels like filler), very bad cinematography (the cinematography just looks so amateur at times because it clearly just shows they were using a green screen/cgi for most of the movie; the frame-rate changes throughout the movie threw me off as it makes me question where the 200 million dollar budget went; the pov, eye-blinking shots just felt so tacky and amateur), decent sound, bad editing (just made the movie feel so tacky as many scenes, especially the action scenes, feel so poorly put together), very bad visual effects (it just looks so obvious where they used green screens and cgi as none of the places look real, also the cat is cgi (which made me lose any hope that this movie was going to look realistic at all)), bad production design (so obvious they used green screens instead of shooting on-site), bad makeup (it hurts that they made this a pg-13 movie because there was barely any blood (which made no sense because there were a lot of chest and headshots)), pacing is incredibly slow because there is just so much meaningless plot (that you just feel bored half the time), climax is incredibly formulaic and predictable (which is given with the direction the movie was already heading), tone feels honestly more similar to drunk history than a funny/light-hearted spy movie because it felt like they were retelling a plot that made no sense (because they were probably drunk when they wrote, directed, shot, scored, edited, marketed, and distributed this movie), they basically threw away their pg-13 f-word.",3

"462","argylle"," explodes on to the screen but doesn't reach its potential.","steveinadelaide",2024-02-08,"prepare for an exhilarating experience with the film argylle (2024). it's a blend of action, comedy, and espionage that promises to keep you entertained, although it may not leave an impact. imagine a world where elly conway (portrayed by bryce dallas howard), an author famous for her spy novels, discovers that her fictional creations are somehow manifesting in reality. as the boundaries between imagination and perilous international intrigue blur, you'll embark on a journey like the truman show colliding with james bond, sprinkled with the flair of kingsman.argylle features a cast comprising henry cavill, sam rockwell, and john cena. cavill contributes his signature sultry charm, bringing an endearing clumsiness to the spy role of argylle. howard delivers a mesmerising performance as she embodies sass and intelligence reminiscent of joan holloway from mad men. rockwell steals scenes effortlessly with his portrayal of the villain. however, some characters feel underdeveloped, lacking motivations, and have unexplored backstories.director matthew vaughn showcases awe inspiring techniques throughout the film. the action sequences are meticulously choreographed yet occasionally intense; they're accentuated by slow motion shots and panels that pay homage to comics.the vibrant array of colours immediately grabs your attention, and the overall production design exudes a sophisticated feel. however, similar to consuming excessive amounts of sugar, the constant bombardment of visuals can grow tiresome over time. it left me yearning for more substance in terms of the story and characters.the soundtrack, with its combination of pulsating beats and orchestral flourishes, nicely complements the action. however, when it comes to the dialogue, well, let's just say it won't be winning any awards for its writing. it oscillates between banter and cringe worthy attempts at humour, leaving me longing for more substantial conversations.the editing is sharp and mirrors the film's pace. however, this frenzied energy works against the narrative. it leaves you feeling disoriented and emotionally detached. we never truly get a chance to forge a connection with the characters or fully grasp what's at stake.so what resonated with me? the sheer audacity of this film stands out. it fearlessly tackles something, even if it doesn't achieve it successfully. most of the performances are enjoyable. there's no denying that the action sequences are impressive (except for the obvious cgi usage). however, the inconsistencies in tone, character portrayal, and indulgent writing style ultimately hinder argylle from achieving its potential.",6
"463","argylle"," what walt's watching","waltermwilliams",2024-02-05,"full disclosure i will watch any movie sam rockwell (""aidan"") is in, because he has great comedic timing and more depth than a shakespearean actor.he stars in director matthew vaughn's spy-themed universe (through his marv studios) in what starts off as good, goofy fun, change of pace from vaughn's usual r-rated ""kick-ass"" and ""layer cake.""vaughn himself says he wanted to make a movie his young daughters could see...sure they could watch it, doesn't mean they'll understand this bond on lsd inspired flick.vaughn is all about this universe being interconnected and comprising the ""kingsman"" franchise with the argylle films, and an unnamed third franchise...apparently.it is a bloated movie that can be exhausting to keep pace with.""argylle"" has enough enjoyable moments to help you forget it's messy and mostly good fun.vaughn cast henry cavill as ""argylle"" because he needed someone who was born to play james bond.cavill was a finalist to play ""bond"" in casino royale (2006), but was rejected for being too young (22 at the time).this is in fact henry cavill's fourth spy film.the other three are: the cold light of day (2012), the man from u. n. c. l. e. (2015) and mission: impossible - fallout (2018).even the director describes this movie as his ode to 1980s action movies like ""die hard"" (1988) and ""lethal weapon"" (1987), with plenty of ""bond"" sub flooring.bryce dallas howard as fiction author ""elly conway"" named taylor swift as an inspiration for her character.howard's reasoning?, ""she is a cat lady. she's got this awesome backpack with a cat in it that she walks around with. she loves a good argyle sweater, and there is a sort of unapologetic dorkiness about her.""no argument from this critic.""alfie"" the cat is played by chip, actually owned by matthew vaughn's wife supermodel claudia schiffer.if she'd married one of the ""thunderbirds"" instead she could have become claudia schiffer-brains. (couldn't resist the bad dad joke.)the cast features two oscar winners in rockwell and the first queer woman of colour to receive the statue in an acting category (""west side story"") ariana debose.it also has two oscar nominees in samuel l. jackson and bryan cranston.remember samuel l. jackson starred as the sociopathic villain ""valentine"" in matthew vaughn's spy movie: ""kingsman: the secret service"" (2014).the star studded cast also includes richard e. grant, whom i follow on twitter because he's such a talented human being, singer dua lipa as ""lagrange"" (a tribute to rockers zz top) and catherine o'hara (""home alone"" and ""schitt's creek"")just for the record ""argylle"" is named after the argyle diamond design that originated in scotland and features strongly in the credits and the movies poster.coming in at around $200 million, this is matthew vaughn's most expensive film, and the most expensive film produced by apple, tied with killers of the flower moon (2023).what have i learned from ""argylle""?""vascular corridor"" is a real thing and you don't want to get it wrong!watch out for:the train sequence (strongly influenced by ""bullet train""), the mini-moke californian chase scene, plus the ice skating on oil scene and the very colourful corridor smoke bomb shoot out.""argylle"" has lots of moving parts.the recently released found beatles song, ""now & then"" features heavily and sits well in the soundtrack along with another track during the closing credits that would be right at home in ""skyfall"".just like the evergreen stage production agatha christie's ""mousetrap"" once you know the secret don't let the cat out of the bag.""argylle"" has more twists than a packet of ""twisties"" (a cheddar flavoured snack from smiths)...because life's pretty straight without twisties.as they say so often in this movie, ""the greater the spy the greater the lie"" and i'd be lying if i said this was matthew vaughn's finest hour, because it's not, but it is an entertaining, laughter filled way to spend over 2 hours at the cinema.stay for: ""argylle's"" post-credits scene which is a neon sign pointing directly to vaughn's massively popular series of kingsman films.",7

""aidan"" will do his best to protect her from ""the director"" and his assassins. with an already crazy story, there is still something up. find out what happens as this novel blends with reality.""argylle"" was a huge letdown. as whole. at this point, a matthew vaughn film will be hit or miss. i like some of the ""king's man"" films. the only problem is that he does a little too much. the parts you like he keeps adding, making them wonky. then you have the actual wonky scenes. by the time it's done, you'll be left feeling a little dissatisfied.this film cost two hundred million dollars to make. with an all-star lineup of actors and star power. like dua lipa, samuel l. jackson, and catherine o'hara, to name a few. the cast alone had to cost a grip. everything was at no expense. shockingly, when i saw this was an apple production, i thought it was going to be good.it wasn't bad; it just wasn't good all the way either. i loved bryce dallas howard. i don't know about sam rockwell playing the spy. i do know they went overboard with too many scenes. i was so confused by it all. the action was good at times, but even that went too far.they were little things. i hoped they didn't do the whole film like that because it was creative yet still annoying. i couldn't stand the ending. it seemed like the film never wanted to end. there is even a post-credit scene. expect a lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of ridiculousness. with a lavish who's who of actors acting in it. i give it two more fires üî•üî•.#cosmoandthemoviewithin

the plot of ""argylle"" is convoluted and poorly executed, with numerous plot holes and inconsistencies that detract from the overall viewing experience. the storyline lacks depth and fails to provide a compelling narrative arc, leaving audiences feeling disconnected from the characters and their motivations. the pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition that do little to advance the plot and action sequences that feel forced and contrived.**underdeveloped characters:**
despite the efforts of the cast, the characters in ""argylle"" are thinly sketched and lack depth or complexity. the protagonist is a generic action hero archetype, lacking the charisma and depth needed to make him compelling. the supporting cast fares no better, with one-dimensional characters who serve little purpose beyond advancing the flimsy plot.**predictable and formulaic:**
""argylle"" follows a predictable and formulaic formula, offering little in the way of originality or innovation. the plot twists and turns are telegraphed well in advance, robbing the film of any sense of suspense or tension. the dialogue is clich√©d and uninspired, with characters delivering cringe-worthy one-liners that fail to land.**lackluster action sequences:**
for a film billed as an espionage thriller, ""argylle"" disappoints with its lackluster action sequences. the choreography feels stilted and unconvincing, lacking the fluidity and intensity needed to make the fight scenes engaging. the use of special effects is overdone and distracting, pulling viewers out of the moment rather than drawing them in.**overall, ""argylle"" is a forgettable and underwhelming entry into the espionage genre. with its weak plot, underdeveloped characters, predictable storytelling, and lackluster action sequences, the film fails to deliver the thrills and excitement expected from a spy thriller. viewers would be better off looking elsewhere for their cinematic espionage fix.**",4

"483","argylle"," not for everyone, but perfect for me","the_critical_movie_enjoyer",2024-02-06,"i can totally see why some people would think that argylle is the dumbest thing they've ever seen in their life. the movie can get so goofy that it will put people that want great storytelling off. with that being said, i love this movie. i think you need to go into it with the right mindset. don't go into it expecting amazing storytelling or for it to be very deep and smart, because that's not the type of movie it is, nor is it the type of movie it's trying to be. this movie is goofy as hell and it knows it. it is intentionally some of the wackiest stuff ever, and if you are not a film snob, and can sit back, turn off your brain, and just enjoy some wacky fun, you are going to have a blast with this movie. simply put, argylle is some of the most fun i've had in a while with hollywood movies. they just don't make them like this anymore. with so many movies these days having such bland cinematography and direction, with boring action sequences and everything has to be super serious, it was such a blast being able to sit down and just have fun with a movie. the movie has so much style and charm. the direction is phenomenal and it's never a bore to look at. as a huge matthew vaughn fan, this movie really rocks for me. it is very similar in tone with, ""the golden circle,"" so the best indicator if you'll like this movie or not is if you liked, ""the golden circle,"" the action scene in the train oozes so much style and creativity, with it cutting back and forth between sam rockwell and henry cavill. the camera movement is very fluid and dynamic. matthew vaughn really likes to move the camera a lot, as opposed to keeping static shots, and it really shows. it really helps add a lot of style to the fights. the fight was also really funny with how it utilizes the back and forth between cavill and rockwell. the scene with bryce in the bathroom while the fight is going on outside got me dying from laughter, and it's another example of the movie maybe being not for you. the scene with the rainbow clouds in the hallway, and bryce dallas and sam rockwell are shooting people while dancing like a musical number is so goddamn creative and i absolutely love it. again, it's just so nice to have a movie that has so much visual flare and style. especially since movies like this are rare nowadays, it's very nice to have been able to see a movie like that again. and the skating across oil scene is so ridiculously stupid and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but that's the point. the movie knows it's dumb, and it has fun with it. the scene is so well shot and choreographed, the camera is fluid and the music accompanies it perfectly with an appropriately wacky yet majestic soundtrack. this movie, it's just for me. it feels like it was made in every way that i like. and as a plus, the story is actually quite intriguing, entertaining, and was honestly way deeper than i was expecting it to be. elly conway (bryce dallas howard) is writing a series of books called argylle, which is where the movie gets the name from. and the books that she writes are eerily similar to real events that happened that are completely top secret. there is also some nice cinematography in the way that the movie shows how she envisions the scenes when she's writing them, and how when she gets writers block the words fall from the page. the whole movie is very creative in the way that it's shot and portrays the mind of a writer. so the fight scene on the train happens, and we learn that aidan wilde (sam rockwell) is actually the real life spy equivalent of argylle, and that a fake evil organization that she wrote in her books is actually real. the division is the name of this group and they've been monitoring elly. the division is led by director ritter (bryan cranston) and they hope that through the books that elly writes, they'll be able to locate and destroy a master file that has all of the information on them, and aidan takes elly so that he can get the master file first. this leads them on wacky hijinks with tons of fun action, filled with twists and turns. she hears aidan saying that he wants so murder conway, so elly thinks that he is talking about her. she runs away and calls her parents to come help her. it is then revealed that director ritter is elly's dad, and that both of the parents work with the division, and that the reason that aidan says that he wants to murder conway is because he was talking about her mother. the movie has tons of these twists and turns that add to the excitement and adrenaline levels this movie pumps you with. about 20 minutes later it's revealed that the reason that her books are so similar to things that have happened in the past is because she was a spy working with aidan and their boss alfie (samuel l. jackson) which is why she named her cat the same name, and that all of the books have actually been her re-writing the events of her life before she got amnesia and the division brainwashed her into thinking that she had a whole different life, with director ritter as her dad, so that she would reveal the information that the division needed through the stories she told in her books, and also that the reason that the book is named argylle is because her real name was rachel kylle aka r. kylle. it is dumb but really cool and adds to the different elements that make this movie more interesting than just a dumb action movie for me. it also explains why she keeps seeing argylle in real life, as it was her brain trying to break out of the brain washing and remind her of who she really was. later after they recover the master file they discover that elly was also a sleeper agent for the division who killed the person that they were looking for before she got the amnesia. this story just has so many twists that is is part of the fun, as you're constantly on edge, waiting to see what dumb twist is going to happen next. and the movie is aware of this and is in on the joke, so instead of laughing at the movie, you're laughing with it. from there they get captured by the division and they have to break out and send the file to alfie before the division can erase it. to conclude, the movie is super fun. it has so many fun twists and turns that it leaves you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. it's directed with such style and creativity. all of the actors do such a fantastic job as these characters, and help bring so much life to this movie. and outside of that, the story itself is interesting and captivating, and while not being the most intelligent or deep thing out there, it's part of the charm that the movie goes for. i think that this movie absolutely knocks it out of the park with what it wants to accomplish, and while definitely not for everyone, i had an absolute blast with this movie.",8

"506","argylle"," argylle","jboothmillard",2024-02-10,"the trailers for this movie looked really cool, from the big names in the cast to the entertaining plot, i was excited to see it, produced and directed by matthew vaughn (kick-ass, x-men: first class, kingsman: the secret service). basically, reserved spy novelist elly conway (bryce dallas howard) is the successful author of the argylle book series, espionage novels featuring the secret agent aubrey argylle. she has almost finished her fifth book and is unsure how to end it; she often visualises the story and the adventures of title character argylle (henry cavill). elly, with her beloved cat alfie (chip, owned by director vaughn and his supermodel wife, claudia schiffer) is on a train heading to visit her parents, ruth (catherine o'hara) and barry. during the journey, she is approached by aidan wilde (sam rockwell) who recognises her from the most recent argylle book cover. shortly after, a group of agents attempt to kill her, but he saves her and helps her to escape. in hiding and after shaving his beard, aidan explains to elly that he is a real secret agent who has gone rogue. he says that she has been targeted by a devious organisation called the division who want her dead because her novels have seemingly predicted their future. aidan travels with elly to england, hoping that her next chapter will reveal how to stop the division. meanwhile, the division, headed by director ritter (bryan cranston), is trying to work out elly's whereabouts. in london, aidan and elly search for a ""masterkey"" that would help expose the organisation which she had also referenced in her novels. elly hears a conversation aidan is having and suspects he wants to kill her as well. in panic, she calls her parents for help. as they arrive, her father is revealed to be ritter. aidan reveals that they are operatives of the division, and they try to kill her before they manage to escape again. fleeing to france, aidan takes elly to meet former cia deputy director alfie solomon (samuel l. jackson), seemingly whom she unintentionally named her cat after. they reveal that argylle is not entirely fictional: elly is in fact agent rachel kylle, ""argylle"" was seemingly derived from ""r. kylle"". she was captured and brainwashed by the division five years ago, and made to believe that ruth, aka dr. margaret vogeler, and director ritter, were her parents. her suppressed memories slowly manifested into her spy novels. in the latest argylle novel, elly was about to reveal the whereabouts of the masterkey before her cover was blown. elly, now rachel and changing her hair colour from hinger to blonde, travels with aidan to arabia, where they retrieve the masterkey. but they are soon cornered by the division and are knocked out and taken to the division's base. ritter reveals that rachel was a double agent and one of their most loyal assets. she offers to interrogate aidan, subsequently shooting him, and she locates alfie for them. but she reveals that she has betrayed the division, she has in fact sent alfie the masterkey. ritter stops the transmission, but aidan has survived his gunshot and helps her to fight their way through the series of assassins. this includes a gun battle in corridors with colourful smoke and an oil spillage with rachel skating across it mounting blades onto her boots as skates to kill more assassins. ritter makes another attempt to kill them, but alfie the cat scratches out his eyes, allowing aidan to shoot him dead. it is revealed they are aboard the division's ocean base. vogeler appears and, using a music box tune and a code word to trigger a mental change, causes rachel to try and kill aidan. but vogeler is killed by keira (ariana debose), a former cia agent and rachel and aidan's partner who was thought to have died in a mission. her experiences were seen in elly's novels as her character, wyatt (john cena). after the download of the information to alfie has been completed, the trio escape in a boat before aidan detonates a bomb aboard the division's ship. returning to the persona of novelist elly, rachel publishes her final novel in the argylle series. at a reading for an audience of fans, the real argylle reveals himself, much to rachel's shock and confusion. in a mid-credits scene, a young aubrey argylle (louis partridge) is in the king's man pub; the first novel was based on his life as an agent. also starring dua lipa as lagrange, richard e. grant as director fowler, rob delaney as deputy director powell, and sofia boutella as saba al-badr. howard is perfectly cast as the initially hesitant then kick-ass super-spy, rockwell is likeable as the agent who guides her to help her memories return, cavill in his suits and with a flattop haircut is cool as the imagined title spy, cranston and o'hara get their moments, and chip is an adorable animal. it reminded me a lot of the long kiss goodnight as the story unfolded, it is fair to say that the twists are a little mixed, and the overall plot is all over the place, but i just about went with it. the pop songs used (""now and then"" by the beatles, ""let's dance"" by david bowie) especially during the guns blazing sequences (""run by leona lewis) are funny, the fights and chases are energetic, the fast-paced oil skating sequence being the highlight, the cgi effects might be shoddy at times, but for escapism and entertainment this is easy to settle into, a fun spy action comedy. good!",6

"561","argylle"," a messy, but thoroughly entertaining spy flick","jaredkjacoby",2024-02-04,"writer elly conway is working on her fifth book in her argylle novel series which is about a competent and dashing spy named agent argylle. her mom offers to visit to help her brainstorm ideas for the ending, but elly decides to take a train to her mom's house. however, elly finds herself on a train full of spies, one of them being aiden who protects her from all of the other passengers attacking them. aiden helps elly get out of harms way and shows her that what she writes in her books is connected to something real and sinister going on.argylle is a movie full of twists and turns that slowly make the movie become more and more absurd. it starts off as a typical espionage adventure with some elements of the lost city with an author out of her element for adventure. then, it becomes increasingly zany with reveals left and right. while the movie is not an outright parody, the tone is definitely more comical than matthew vaughn's other work. honestly, while the movie is insane and a bit bloated, i was never bored. in fact, once the plot kicked in, the runtime went by smoothly.argylle for all its quirks is a very entertaining movie with a lot of flair. what i think this movie gets right is the zaniness of the story. there is hardly a beat here that makes sense, but the movie never takes itself too seriously. some of the twists actually surprised me because they can come out of left field. it is nice to see a movie just relax and have fun with its premise.the cast is fantastic. they all know what movie they signed up for and they have a blast. bryce dallas howard is great as elly conway. she embodies the stressed writer who can be savy, but her performance in the second half showed her chops for this kind of movie. sam rockwell is clearly having the time of his life here with how he plays as a spy. his introductory scene where he helps elly escape shows his personality of a laid back spy. howard and rockwell work well together as their chemistry makes the pair more likable. they especially shine in the third act.while the leads are awesome, the supporting cast is mixed. a lot of the actors i was excited for ended up wasted. john cena only has five minutes of screen time, samuel l. jackson doesn't get enough to do and sofia boutella only gets one scene. henry cavil makes for a cool spy character, but he doesn't get a whole lot to do because he is only a character in elly's story. i know that there is a saying of small role and big impact, but i really wanted to see more of these guys. however, bryan cranston does a great job as the over-the-top bad guy. he hams up his role and it is always fun to see him deliver his lines. on the other hand, catherine o'hara stood out for me. without spoiling the plot, she kills her roll and is pretty interesting. the cast is great, but some of them could have been used better.the visuals and cinematography are pretty good for the most part. some of the cgi is noticeable, especially in the opening car chase which looks a bit cartoony, but for the most part, the movie looks solid. since this movie is only pg-13 and not r, matthew vaughn finds a way to sprinkle his style in the action scenes with two in particular standing out... and those two scenes are awesome. it is rare for a movie like this to embrace its zaniness in its action scenes the way this one does. the two set pieces involving a dance and ice skating are some of the coolest action scenes i have seen in a while. they also scream matthew vaughn. not all of the action scenes are amazing, but when it works, it works well. the cinematography is beautiful with some inspiring shots. one includes a shot of henchmen with the reflection of a spoon. that's creative. the costume design and makeup are both really fun to look at as are the set designs. the scene with sofia boutella's character is particularly striking. the musical score is nothing special, but the movie does make good use of the songs it has, especially the song run by snow patrol.overall, in spite of its messiness, i really argylle. it could benefited from an r-rating and not all of the twists work, but i was never bored with this movie for even a second. each scene, i was trying to guess what crazy turn would the story take next. i enjoy this kind of craziness to plots sometimes. i do feel that the reception this movie is getting is a little harsh. for my money, this movie is definitely worth checking out. even with its slightly long run time, it never felt long.stay through the credits.",7

"573","argylle"," the film's charm starts to unravel as it succumbs to the weight of its own convolutions and an indulgent runtime that overstays its welcome.","jaysonpajaronvistal",2024-02-18,"argylle is a new spy movie that tries to stand out by being fun and full of action from the start. sadly, it gets too complicated and drags on longer than it should, which spoils the fun. the movie kicks off with a lot of excitement, showing us the main character, argylle, who's cool and confident, getting through tricky situations and risky moves with ease. but as the story gets more complex, the movie begins to lose steam.what starts as an enjoyable spy flick starts to feel like hard work as the plot gets too twisted and confusing. the humor and the cool action that we liked at first don't hit the same when the story gets more and more mixed up. even the big action parts start to feel like too much, especially a car chase in the middle of the movie that just keeps going and going. it's these parts where the movie feels stuffed and could have used some cutting down to keep the excitement alive.one of the biggest problems with argylle is that it thinks viewers will be okay with a story that doesn't make much sense. the twists in the movie, instead of making it better, often seem fake and leave us wondering what's going on. characters make decisions that defy logic, and the plot twists, which are presumably intended to shock and awe, instead evoke a sense of bewilderment at their sheer randomness.on top of that, the movie tries to be funny, but sometimes the jokes don't match the dangerous situations the characters are in. this makes it hard to tell if the movie is trying to make fun of spy movies or if it's trying to be a serious spy movie itself. in the end, when the movie should be wrapping things up neatly, it just makes things more muddled. the big final battle, which should have been the best part, falls flat because the movie already went overboard with too many other scenes, leaving us more tired than excited.to sum it up, argylle could have been a cool new spy movie, but it's let down because it didn't cut out the unnecessary parts and didn't stay focused. it would have been much better if it was shorter and got to the point more. as it is, argylle shows that sometimes, keeping things simple is the best way to go.",4

in selected cinemas nowsaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress emerald fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance promising young woman which starred her friend carey mulligan.carey mulligan only plays a cameo role in saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of poor dear pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.carey mulligan in an interview with margo robbie a co producer of saltburn said that the role emerald fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. on reading the script carey mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear pamela and emerald agreed to her request .i'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of lady elspeth catton played in the movie to perfection by oscar nominee rosamund pike.this movie in fact has four oscar nominees in the cast richard e. grant, barry keoghan, carey mulligan and rosamund pike.it's no wonder to me that emerald fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an academy award, two british academy film awards, one screen actors guild award, and nominations for three primetime emmy awards and three golden globe awards.one reviewer described this movie as a promising young man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.my only regret with this movie is the fact that emerald fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
the magnificent cinematography by linus sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.i call this movie an art house black comedy thriller if i had to describe it in a few words i think i would say it's brideshead revisited with the style of peter greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like the draughtsman's contract , drowning by numbers and the cook, the thief, his wife & her lover .this wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . it may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.not everyone will share my view but i adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.i couldn't help thinking of evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited while watching saltburn so after seeing the movie i wasn't surprised to read that emerald fennell recommended jacob elordi the brisbane born handsome actor read brideshead revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .in complete contrast jacob will be playing elvis presley in the forthcoming movie pricilla based on the early relationship of pricilla beaulieu and elvis .in saltburn jacob elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection felix catton the son and heir of sir james catton played with delicious detachment by richard e grant and elspeth catton perfectly cast with the glamorous rosamund pike .rosamund pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by sophie canale who was assistant costume designer on bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper oliver quick also played to perfection by the academy award nominated irish supporting actor barry keoghan in the banshees of inisherin barry keoghan.barry keoghan's character oliver quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .his character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his summer of love into a quest of betrayal.the movie begins with oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic felix catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts oliver's nerdy dullness . oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of felix catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.similar to brideshead felix invites oliver to spend the summer at his family's ancestral home saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch elspeth .no spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.as mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled radcliffe square in oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.the stately home that emerald fennell chose as saltburn is drayton house in northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
i haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were archie madekwe as the young border at saltburn farleigh start who sees through oliver quick and becomes an object of jealousy.also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household annabelle played by sadie soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing butler played by paul rhys are wonderful.i'd love to spend a day in emerald fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in killing eve ,promising young woman and now saltburn i find fascinating.",9
"606","saltburn"," slow and predictable","grantss",2023-12-30,"oliver quick, an awkward, insular young man from the north of england arrives at oxford university and struggles to fit in. however, his situation changes when he befriends felix catton, born into wealth and very popular. one summer holiday felix invites oliver to the family estate, saltburn. now oliver will get to see how the upper class live.a film that had potential as an examination of class divides, and social differences in general, and also as a dark thriller. while there is some degree of both of these, it is quite the damp squib.the setup takes forever, with many scenes that really don't add any colour to the characters or flesh to the plot. everything takes forever to develop when it could have been done more quickly and engagingly.after a point it is fairly obvious where everything is heading and when the main plot development arrives the aftermath is quite implausible (any further discussion would provide spoilers). then, just to prove that the writers assume that the audience consists of morons, there is a huge ""look at how clever we are"" revelation scene which is hardly a revelation at all as that was what most of us knew or suspected all along.i was hoping for one more twist that would have redeemed the plot to a degree but that never came.nothing to recommend about this film, ultimately. don't waste your time on it.",4

"610","saltburn"," loved it","uvz-54425",2024-02-01,"the movie was quite enjoyable, albeit slightly too ambitious. it seemed to struggle in balancing between an aristocratic setting, lacking the depth found in works like 'brideshead revisited' or alan hollinghurst's 'the line of beauty', and a psychological thriller aspect, which, while entertaining, came across as overly sensational and somewhat lacking in credibility. at times, the plot developments were so outlandish that they were more amusing than serious. saltburn was on the verge of being a masterpiece with its wealth of excellent content. it's still a worthwhile watch, despite some superficial elements and a feeling that fennell and the screenwriter didn't fully explore their characters, choosing sensationalism instead. quick's portrayal of a sociopath was intriguing yet not entirely convincing, but the film was still an enjoyable experience overall. it has more strengths than weaknesses.",9
"611","saltburn"," this movie had moments, but ""shocking"" meets unnecessary","redwingsme",2023-11-26,"if you're a film major you probably loved this movie. so much symbolism and it takes unexpected turns. but its ""shocking"" moments are so odd that ruin what could have otherwise been a good story. i'm sure some of these 10 out 10 ratings will call on the message of mental illness as thought provoking or other flowery symbolism that is unlike the typical hollywood movie. but i would avoid this if you are an average filmgoer. especially those that just wants to see a movie that is entertaining and unique without leaving you feel like you just watched some screen writers most dismayed plot just to be edgy.there were a couple truly disgusting scenes of perversion that added no value to the story. not to mention the holes in the plot. holes like why would he go through the lengths that he took to infiltrate and take down the family members one by one? oh, because he loved felix so much....right. we find out that he set out to befriend felix from the very start, but why? this would have made more sense if there was an actual motive other than he was unbalanced and just wanted to be loved. save your time and money.",2
"612","saltburn"," 2 bonus stars for soundtrack","dargumin",2023-11-21,"this was awful. the characters were one dimensional, and it kept going long after the film felt ""done"". whilst oliver is obviously the bad guy, they could have still given him a smidge of likeability (eg patrick bateman) but literally there's nothing to like about him.let's be honest, the film should end when felix meets olivers parents, there's no way he'd be allowed back in saltburn after that. it then rushes through the 3rd act where the body count stacks up so quickly it doesn't have time to be impactful. the grave scene was utterly ridiculous, i felt embarrassed for everyone involved in the making of that scene, but yeah somehow it got made.respect to the music supervisor though, some great choices including bloc party & tomcraft. the 00s truly the last truly decent decade of music and cinema.",3
"613","saltburn"," promising characterisation, but fails to deliver","ayupgeeza",2023-11-19,"it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema.",4
"614","saltburn"," will take you to some places you didn't know you wanted to go","jtindahouse",2023-09-30,"quick review: i loved emerald phannell's debut film 'promising young woman'. it was hard to believe it was a debut feature. i hadn't even heard she was doing a follow-up film until suddenly i was watching it as the secret screening at fantastic fest. needless to say it blew me away. this was a terrific film experience.i think the thing i love most about phannell's work is the attention and care she gives to every character. there are no throwaway character's in these movies. everyone has a purpose and every character is fascinating in their own way.when that's the case it can be hard to single out a particularly good character/performance, and really everyone here was worthy of mention, but in particular i have to bring up rosamund pike. she stole every scene she was in. also barry keoghan is fast becoming the best actor working today. he is captivating to watch here.'saltburn' was such a pleasant surprise. i loved every minute of it and would highly recommend it. be warned though: this film is not afraid to go to some shocking places. 10/10.",10

"616","saltburn"," bogus","ferdinand1932",2023-12-26,"raymond chandler remarked: the english may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers.he could have said this about saltburn where class consciousness is coded in the english dna like nowhere else and furnishes enough material to retain funding, however threadbare it is.the themes of saltburn are like pieces filched from howard's end and brideshead revisited and no doubt other, lesser, books about country piles, as well as the 1930s detective novels that chandler was referring to in his spiking of english writing.class, real estate and sex could be the holy trinity of a certain type of english writing, lazy, dilettantish and effete. add oxford undergrads to the plot and the languorous destiny of the story is foreknown in the opening credits.with such worn material adding some spice is required and thus, drinking bodily fluids, instigating - or simulating - necrophilia through a meter of dirt on a grave, should supply the necessary frisson to an audience that could be comatose. these disingenuous tactics, however, do not dispel chandler's remark of it being dull. immeasurably so.nor does the photographic eroticism of the demi-monde in the fields and the sunlight flaring in the lenses cover up the shallow sentiments displayed. rather like the clich√© parents of saltburn, who talk like stock characters from a 1930s parlour play that ought to have been forgotten, these tropes should be in a theatrical and cinematic op-shop.but where it really falls over is the end which chooses facile plotting to provide some ending with its redundant ballet through the newly acquired pile; intended to show victorious power, though it comes across rather like benjamin field.a hollow, grubby, film which ought to have understood the motto at the beginning of brideshead: et in arcadia ego.",3

"618","saltburn"," fennell's nasty films depend on an absurdly dumb, easily duped set of victims","210west",2024-01-06,"fennell's previous film, ""promising young woman,"" was a hate fantasy about wreaking vengeance on a bunch of abusive guys (and one woman administrator) responsible for the death of the heroine's friend. as happens in such fantasies (and only in such fantasies), every step of her plan went way too smoothly; the avenging heroine easily tricked all the men -- reducing them, one by one, to contrite weeping wimps -- and humiliated the woman administrator, leaving her crushed.the hate fantasy in this new film succeeds with even more implausible ease. a homely, inarticulate, lumpish nerd at oxford is -- implausibly -- befriended by a tall, handsome, immensely wealthy fellow student who takes him home to his lavish, implausibly underpopulated country estate the size of buckingham palace, where his aristocrat family lives with what appears to be a single butler and two footmen (except at one point near the end, where a gaggle of servants we've never seen before suddenly appear). this family -- implausibly sappy, since the success of the comic-book plot depends on their being a bunch of absolute patsies -- takes the lumpish young visitor to its bosom, lavishing upon him a totally unbelievable degree of attention and affection.... whereupon, halfway through the movie, the inarticulate young visitor is suddenly revealed to be a smooth-talking, machiavellian, diabolical psychopath who neatly -- did i mention implausibly? -- murders the family members, one by one, and in the end inherits the estate.so basically, the movie starts out as ""brideshead revisited,"" only cruder and ickier, and midway through turns into ""the omen,"" only dumber.there's one original surprise involving the young man's return home. i didn't even recognize the wonderful actress dorothy atkinson as his mother. and archie madekwe is all too believable as the sort of arrogant, racially privileged type we don't often see depicted in today's media.",5
"619","saltburn"," happy castle dance","ferguson-6",2023-11-21,"greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023.",7

""saltburn"" absolutely delivered the thrills, laughs, weirdness, sexiness, eeriness, and stylish personality that the first film encompasses but double downs on it tenfold. it is a very british psychological thriller with plenty of charm, youthful energy, and originality. the early 2000s aesthetic is lush and on point. i truly believe that this film utilizes the so-called 'eat the rich' narrative perfectly, and is easily the best film of that genre. the film is kind of a cross between jordan peele's ""get out"" and mike white's ""the white lotus"". i need the film's soundtrack like yesterday. i have nothing but undying respect, gratitude, and praise for filmmaker emerald fennell.

"638","saltburn"," saltburn","hamzaarifshuja",2024-02-17,"saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.",7

there is no reason for anyone to like oliver. ever. barry keoghan plays him great, but it isn't like he flips a switch and becomes charismatic. in fact, he just becomes a weirdo saying charismatic things. perhaps that's the intention. the family is so devoid of emotion that any genuine sign of it gains acceptance. again, i never felt that.there is absolutely no reason for oliver to know that felix would be so generous as to ingratiate him into his family by a flat tire ruse. the conceit of this entire film relies on the idea that oliver is a grifter preying on this family and that someone would be kind enough to take him in. he sees what he wants, then has the shameless nature of approaching each one to gain favor. honestly, one of the worse flip of the switch is when oliver observes the sister of the household and seduces her (after a few words--saying she's a nympho doesn't make it so).any way, rosamund pike is the only good thing about this flick. jacob elordi is also really good at embodying the rich snob with a heart. the rest is a bit mediocre. if you've seen these types of identity starved sociopath movies, you'll know what you're watching.",6

"681","saltburn"," just give barry keoghan his damn oscar already","cmtempest",2023-12-10,"evidently the jinx of the ""sophomore slump"" held no claim over emerald fennell, britain's new filmmaking auteur and cinematic wunderkind. in only her second movie, the popular writer-director has already soared past expectations, delivering a film which not only far surpasses the success of her debut promising young woman (which was excellent), but which succeeds so well in all its ambitions that it just might belong in the conversation for genre classic. it certainly ranks quite high among my personal favorites for films of its kind.in my opinion, saltburn is a masterpiece. a purely singular, cinematic tour-de-force, with an abundance of style, all put to use in service of a story that is both attractive and engrossing, while never ceasing to be entertaining. it's the kind of film that sears itself in your memory with its brazenness-to say nothing of the level of prurience that permeates some of the more salacious/depraved bits. i know that sounds like it could be a negative, but believe me, it definitely works in this film's favor; keeping the tone both erotically charged as well as deeply unsettling. in fact, the whole film is astoundingly well-balanced, maintaining a sly confidence in itself which makes it all the more entrancing despite (because of?) it taking things to such extremes. occasionally you might feel like recoiling, but you'll remain unable to look away.since the film only released wide several weeks ago, i'll refrain from saying much about plot specifics in this review (nothing beyond superficial comparison anyway), as i'd hate to spoil anyone from having the same incredible experience i had going in blind. this is an opportunity that hopefully most people will be afforded, owing to the stellar marketing for the film which somehow managed to build intrigue without revealing hardly anything about the story (take note studio heads, this is how it should be done!). it's an especially blessed achievement in this case, as this is a film with a deviously good script and it'd be a shame to miss out on its myriad surprises.additionally, with saltburn, emerald fennell has not only gifted us fans of crime/mystery stories with a modern genre masterpiece, she has also given us the best ripley movie without tom ripley. indeed, the film evokes a superlative, verging on definitive, homage to the famous amoral hedonist with a knack for escaping consequences, and i would honestly be shocked to find out fennell wasn't a highsmith fan. at times this script feels almost like a re-imagining of the talented mr. ripley for the millennial generation; albeit one cleverly tailored to the sensibilities and sexual fluidity of the euphoria crowd. the use of hyper-stylized cinematography, as well as the film's decidedly ""in vogue"" choice of music, also evoke the style of that series to a degree. that said, jacob elordi playing against type as the rich aristocrat felix catton (ostensibly a spoiled playboy, but whose surprising sensitive side may reveal him to be an actual decent person) subverts those expectations in the best way.whatever the reality behind her inspiration, this film is in no way a mere imitation of another work. instead, fennell more than proves her mettle as a writer/director capable of executing her unique ideas with extreme precision. frankly, she couldn't seem more at home in the genre, and despite a concept that on the surface may appear to be aiming at mere homage, fennell spares no time proving that notion false; taking a deceptively original approach to a tried and true theme, and running with it to intoxicating effect.saltburn is an utterly enthralling mystery, with an impressively sustained blend of familiarity and unpredictability. the script is brimming with witty dialogue, wickedly dark humor, compelling social commentary on class division, and no shortage of clever twists. all in all, this makes for a fiercely captivating affair from start to finish. so much so, in fact, that when the many disparate threads finally start to come together in the final act, the result is harrowing and nothing short of extraordinary!this is filmmaking of the highest order from someone who is quickly becoming one of the most interesting artists working today. if it wasn't such a crowded year i would say fennell was a shoe-in for another best original screenplay nom. although then again, when considering the uncomfortable nature of certain moments in the film, it may be a stretch to think the academy is ready to vote for something this far out. i hope they're not all too close-minded to recognize fennell's talent though, and this at least ends up getting some (well-deserved) awards attention. in any case, if she's able to keep up the momentum then her work will soon be impossible to ignore, no matter how dark/insane she decides to go with her next project. personally, i'd love to see her re-team with keoghan/mulligan and try her hand at a full-on horror flick!anyways, beyond the film's critical reception, what perhaps will be most interesting is seeing the overall response it gets from general audiences. i'd imagine they won't be expecting just how shocking certain aspects of the story are, and all those forming their expectations based on her first film (like i did) are likely to be caught off guard by a handful of these scenes (if not outright turned off). the film never felt in any way exploitative or pretentious to me though. on the contrary, i felt like the balance and tone that it struck were basically flawless. even if a small number of viewers do find it too offensive, that will probably just add to the allure of the film. ultimately, the purity of conviction shown by the creative team in taking things as far as they did clearly panned out.suffice it to say, i've never seen anything quite like this film, and i was completely blown away. in fact, for me, it rather handily beats out oppenheimer, beau is afraid, and killers of the flower moon as the best of the year, and i'd go so far as to call it a film destined to be discussed, analyzed, argued over, and admired by cinephiles of every kind for years to come.finally, i'd be remiss not to mention the film's true oscar potential, and that's barry keoghan. his raw performance as the socially awkward, yet smart and deeply enigmatic loner oliver quick is so brilliantly nuanced, mysterious, and disturbing that i can all but guarantee it will ""make your blood run cold."" barry is absolutely the underdog to look out for come award season, and this film proves, decisively, that he was the perfect choice to take up the mantle of the joker.rating: 9.5/10.....edited to add - i can't believe i forgot to praise the incredible use of ""murder on the dance floor"" in one of the film's final montages. i've been waiting forever for someone to re-tap the potential of the song, and its use here might be the best of any hit since the pixies' ""where is my mind?"" swelled up at the end of fight club.",9

"683","saltburn"," unforgettable experience","ignatdanilchuk",2024-01-23,"discussed on all social networks, emerald fennell's film ""saltburn"" hooks you from the first minute. the first frames immediately immerse us inside the head of the main character oliver, and do not let us go until the very end.the plot of the film revolves around oliver and felix, who study at oxford. oliver is a shy guy who can't make friends in a new place. but he finds the strength to meet felix. with their acquaintance, their rapprochement into best friends begins.the acting performance of barry keoghan, who played oliver, undeservedly went unnoticed by the film academy. from film to film, barry proves to everyone that he is a great actor, but this film was his peak. he was paired with jacob elordi (felix), familiar to us from the tv series euphoria, who is slowly getting closer to leading roles in films. together with barry, they have great chemistry on camera, and the relationship they develop is interesting to watch.the film was shot in a 4:3 format, unusual for modern times, which at first glance may discourage you from watching the film. but after the first part of the film, every frame justifies the format chosen by the director. the frame, which is narrowed on the sides, makes the characters even closer and the atmosphere more personal, as if the photograph has its own story behind it.emotionally, the film will not leave you indifferent. watching can be compared to a roller coaster. at first we are immersed in one genre, but by the end of the film we find ourselves in a completely different one.overall, this is a film that will keep you engaged. a captivating plot and outstanding acting will make watching ""saltburn"" an unforgettable cinematic experience.",9
"684","saltburn"," overrated","rgxdzrybr",2024-02-01,"i seriously question the praise for this movie. what is going on with people so easily taken in by this because it's supposed to be a dark comedy or satire?the way the main character gets off on the bodily fluids of certain characters is for shock . the idea is that he's vampiric in his obsession with them but emerald fennell who wrote and directed it chooses one of the most grotesque ways of expressing this. it's supposedly a lampooning of the wealthy but they come across in a way we have grown to use to. self satisfied, rude , patronizing when they play their games with lower classes and wannabes. if anything it seems to be saying beware of anyone not impossibly wealthy they will take advantage. nothing the main character does to them makes us care about them so it's all pointless.parasite was good commentary topic of classism. saltburn is dreadful. some decent acting but not enough to make a difference .i also get tired of being told something is a dark comedy when it isn't. fargo was a good dark comedy with a moral center and genuinely funny as well. filmmakers need to look at films like fargo or burn after reading or the apartment and learn how to write a good dark comedy.",1
"685","saltburn"," i liked the minotaur statue","jromanbaker",2024-01-04,"long, long ago there was a horror film made in 3d called ' the maze ' and in the centre there was something shocking and terrible. in this film there is something beautiful and threatening. a minotaur statue with more sexual potency than anything else in this meandering film. i like to think this statue was going to bring down the house of the ruling classes, but alas statues move terribly slowly. in all seriousness ( that's a laugh ) with shades of ' theorem ' and ' the servant ' a handsome young man gets involved with horror of horrors another young man and takes him home to his architecturally appalling pile and introduces him to daddy, mummy and infantile sister. familiar territory and with veiled homoeroticism a gullible audience like me gets a few hammer horror shocks. the grave scene by the way is not that shocking and only one scene is but no more spoilers. the actors do their best, but the two leading young males seemed to walk and dance their way through, but mulligan and pike steal what is left to steal. putting it gently i give it a three because in some weird way it does represent the uk today, and as an historical document for the future it maybe valid. if cinema as we feebly know it now exists by then.",2

"694","saltburn"," like a bad telenovela","waedliman",2023-12-23,"there are probably only two camps when it comes to this movie. some will celebrate it (and misunderstand it), others will reject it because they find it undemanding and confusing. i belong to the second category. maybe i'm too old and have seen enough movies to be able to say that the plot of saltburn isn't really new. i also know absolutely fabulous, so i can see quite clearly that rosamunde pike seems to have stolen from jennifer saunders. her dialog, her tone of voice, everything is reminiscent of edwina monsoon, saunders' character. apart from that, this comedy is not a comedy at all, but mixes satire with drama, is rarely funny, but mostly you wait for the supposedly too obscene scenes, only to realize that they are more likely the result of good marketing around the film. yes, they are unusual, but they fit well with the character of the main character, a narcissist who thinks he has fallen for someone, but whose real goal is something completely different. you eventually realize that this oliver is not the victim he claims to be, but an exceedingly clever fellow who has the entire aristocracy in his pocket. emereld fennell's direction is addicted to beautiful images on the one hand, but on the other we see party scenes like something out of a bad spanish tv series. everything just doesn't want to fit together. in the end, i'm ashamed that i stuck it out. it's not worth it in the end.",4

"721","saltburn"," pretty good movie","cinemapersonified",2023-10-31,"rating: 7.6
overall, a bold attempt at a grand movie in emerald fennell's sophomore effort as she really builds the grand world of saltburn through cinematography and production design and gets a lot out of her actors (especially barry keoghan and jacob elordi), but, in the end, is held back by having too many continuity issues/loose ends and going overboard with the more grotesque scenes.decent to pretty good direction (controlled her scenes well on a macro-scale as she used the cinematography and the sets to tell how grandiose saltburn was (and the dichotomy of how closed off everyone was because of it); did a pretty good job on a micro scale as the one-on-one scenes were good (especially the ones between keoghan and elordi) but the group scenes were not that well executed; the storytelling is overall decent as the overarching story is encapsulated well but the movement between plot points is not as fluid as it could be (with there being some easily spotted continuity issues); some scenes felt very elongated for no reason and were just really meant to shock rather than have any substance), good to very good acting (very good from barry keoghan (really captures the persona of this demented hero well as he shows the lengths the protagonist will go to get what he wants), very good from jacob elordi (really uses his charisma and looks to help propel his performance as he really takes control of all the scenes he is in to act as this heavenly god that the main character is trying to chase), good to very good from rosamund pike (plays the dull/out-of-touch character well and has that elitist british tone that helps with her character), good to very good from richard e. grant (similiar to pike in that he plays a dull/out-of-touch character well), good from alison oliver (has a lot of moments that are good as her character's emotional instability helps portray a young adolescent), good from archie madekwe (plays his character well and has good chemistry being at odds with keoghan), good from carey mulligan (more of a cameo appearance but does a good job in letting her presence be known), good from the rest of the cast (each actor plays their role well as they work off of the main cast)), pretty bad story (the overarching story is interesting and has a lot of mystery to it as the director slowly peels at what is actually going on; the storytelling is not the best as there are a lot of continuity errors (like superbad being played on dvd before it is even out in theaters) and is not that clear at points; the characters were written well and have their clear purpose in the story (with the mystery of the lead character helping drive the story forward); there were just the right amount of plot points (it just felt like some of the overall scenes could have been cut down a bit); the movie does not tie everything up well (and this hurts the story as it is not meant to really have things left open to interpretation)), decent to pretty good screenplay (the dialogue flowed very well and felt like it was of the time and the place; the symbolism is somewhat there but it does not help with portraying the message; the foreshadowing was good as it helped with showing who the main character really is (and was not that predictable)), pretty good score/good soundtrack (really helped with setting the time), incredible cinematography (really felt very grand and helped with showing how big and lost you can be in saltburn), bad sound (the dialogue was not mixed well as a lot of times it was unclear what they were saying or the music was too loud that the dialogue just felt inaudible), decent editing (overall was good and helped with showing how grand saltburn was and how small the subjects were inside it; some of the scenes felt just unnecessarily long and could have been cut to provide the same effect (especially for the more grotesque scenes)), great production design (the sets in saltburn were just so grand and illustrious that they helped with showing the wealth the family had; the college sets were all very stunning as they helped show the history of the school; the party (and aftermath) was designed very well to just show how many people were there), plot structure was good as the points were laid out well and each overall component helped build to the next one (it is just inside of these components it did not feel like the story progressed well between scenes)runtime could have been cut down by making some of the scenes sorter as it would not have that much effect on the story (shaving maybe 5-10 minutes), pacing was fine as it did not feel like it was too fast or slow, climax was decently executed as it is presented in a very shocking way (but the more you think about it the more holes you see in the continuity), tone was very similar to a coming-of-age mixed with a thriller and high-class british themes as this helps show the world the main character is living in, saw a premiere at austin film festival; the grotesque scenes were a bold choice but it does not pay off that well as it just makes the audience feel uneasy than actually showing how deranged some of the actions and characters were.",7

"766","saltburn"," when you're this salty, someone's bound to get burned.","pjtaylor-96-138044",2023-11-21,"'saltburn (2023)' is an incredibly horny movie. it's easily one of the most bisexual films i've seen at the cinema, with a down-bad lead who seemingly wants to have sex with everyone he meets and cinematography that frames the characters as if any of them could start making out with one another at any given moment. seriously, it's as if the camera operators themselves want to get in on the action. pretty much every major player - jacob elordi's felix, in particular - is shot with a sweaty sexuality that lends them an almost ethereal allure. it's like they're actively trying to seduce you through the screen, which the picture itself is attempting in its own way. the female gaze doesn't really exist, but if it did it would look like this; i finally know something about what it must feel like for a straight woman to watch, well, practically anything with a 'sexy' female character in it. at a certain point, the sexual tension snaps with a series of unashamedly shocking, near gross-out gags involving various bodily fluids and unexpected sex acts. the audience i was watching this with were audibly squirming in their seats at some of the more outrageous moments, and perhaps rightfully so. these are undoubtedly the moments which have caused many people to declare the back half of this ""really weird"", and they do kind of come out of nowhere - if not in their inclusion then in their perceived depravity. however, i don't think the second half of the flick is any less successful than the first, and it actually feels like a fairly natural progression of the plot. it's unorthodox, sure, and it starts to sew the first seeds in your mind that maybe the protagonist isn't quite as innocent as he first appears. the general subversiveness of the story does go quite a long way in keeping you invested, as you're never quite sure what's going to happen next or what the characters are actually thinking (or if they're even thinking at all). there's something off about everything at saltburn from the moment it's introduced, and the flick builds this underlying sense of suspense that kind of sneaks up on you. even if its ultimate reveal is handled fairly clumsily, most of the narrative is compelling enough to mostly justify the 130-minute runtime. it helps that the performances are all rock solid, including some expectedly fantastic work from barry keoghan, and that the writing keenly balances dark absurdism with disturbing satire. the cinematography has an appealing almost polaroid - or perhaps 8mm home movie - feel thanks to its 4:3 framing and notable film grain. the film is comprised almost exclusively of interestingly framed, often downright beautiful shots that frequently make perfect use of silhouette and satisfyingly unconventional composition. it's all edited together in a notably excellent fashion, featuring some bracingly vibrant montages that make use of repeated motifs to recontextualise previously seen material. it's a really well-made movie overall, and its narrative is more consistent than a lot of people seem to think. it does get ever-so-slightly repetitive in its midsection and some of its first act could arguably be trimmed, but it's a consistently engaging and darkly funny / funnily dark experience for most of its duration. the ending is a little inelegant, the theming isn't particularly deep and some of its more outlandish moments feel crafted almost solely for shock value, but this is a solid and unconventional feature that almost defies genre and is all the better for it.",7

"782","saltburn"," the film has had a successful limited release in the us and expanded nationwide.","gusherpop",2023-12-27,"saltburn, a sophomore feature by emerald fennell, has been a subject of debate among critics and viewers. some view the film as flashy and self-satisfied, while others see it as a successful erotic thriller with titillating shocks. the film has had a successful limited release in the us and expanded nationwide. however, some critics argue that the film's visuals, such as a character slurping another's bathwater and a cocky ending, may be a sign of perverse genius or cheap tricks masquerading as it. the film has gained popularity on tiktok, with many expressing a rift between its staff and the film's overall aesthetic. the saltburn divide is not a satire film but rather its artifices, including visual provocations, luxe tableaus, and bold telegraphing of desire. vibes are a powerful tool in cinema, allowing audiences to process entertainment that is predominantly based on them. they can be a portal to the intangible particulars of another time, place, or era, as seen in sofia coppola's impressionistic priscilla. many festival circuit films this year, such as raven jackson's all dirt roads taste of salt, jonathan glazer's zone of interest, annie baker's janet planet, and steve mcqueen's occupied city, use feelings, mood, visual language, and sensory experience to communicate the unspoken human experience. these films argue against the tyranny of story in how we evaluate screen-based media, allowing audiences to experience the unspoken human experience through their cinematic experiences. saltburn is a film by fennell that showcases the eccentricities of its characters, but it lacks a cohesive plot. the film's main problem is that most of its plotting is saved for the final stretch, with fennell being vague about everyone's motivations and actions. this results in the film drifting along and suddenly hurries through several major revelations with the speed of someone who wants to reach the end of an anecdote before their phone battery runs out. some of these revelations are more ingenious than others, but fennell is prone to fumble them and has little to say about class divisions that hasn't been said more pithily in several recent films. saltburn may seem half-hearted and lacks the focused anger of promising young woman. however, if seen as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, it is deliriously enjoyable. the dialogue and performances are what clinch it, with oliver being awestruck by the priceless old masters on the house's oak-panelled walls and pike, grant, and mulligan competing to be the most obnoxious. keoghan delivers an impressively committed performance in a movie that considers itself shocking, with ""saltburn's"" final scene being the most true representation. the film's beauty and emptyness are evident, but fennell's set-up leaves viewers wanting more. the final scene is a bravura tracking shot.",10

"816","saltburn"," emerald fennell creates an engaging and uncomfortable psychological satirical thriller with gothic undertones and shades of patricia highsmith","ionicbreezemachine",2023-12-23,"set in the early 2000s, oliver quick (barry keoghan) is a working-class student on scholarship to oxford where he often finds himself isolated due to the cultural divide between him and the other attending students. after befriending wealthy student felix catton (jacob elordi), oliver is invited to spend the summer at felix's family estate saltburn where he meets the eccentric catton family consisting of sir james (richard e. grant) and lady elspeth (rosmund pike), felix's siter venetia (alison oliver), and their cousin farleigh (archie madekwe) who makes no secret of his disdain for oliver. over the course of the summer, oliver ingrains himself into the lifestyle of the cattons until darker revelations reveal themselves and send ripples throughout the catton family and estate.saltburn is this sophomore feature of emerald fennell who previously made a name for herself with 2020's promising young woman. taking inspiration from country house set stories, fennell creates some characters who are despicable but also oddly compelling in a story that takes its time in setup before building to a strong and memorable finish.in terms of acting, saltburn is a fantastic showcase for an ensemble cast with not only the catton family made up of status conscious snobs whose atrocious attitudes are either worn on their sleeves or hidden behind a transparent veil of empty sympathy. all of the characters have some flaw be it in a tenuous grasp on status as is the case with farleigh, a hunger for validation in the case of venetia, or in felix's tendency to pick-up lower class ""strays"". barry keoghan is absolutely fantastic in the role of oliver quick and what starts out as a seemingly innocuous observer into this world of opulence and wealth is soon revealed to be a rich multi-layered portrayal that becomes increasingly absorbing minute by minute as keoghan has to act out certain grotesque or off-putting scenes that would be a challenge for most actors.in terms of the writing, saltburn initially seems like it's trying to position itself as an ""eat the rich"" type story in the vein of the menu or glass onion, but while that element is there i'd say the movie has more in common with the works of patricia highsmith in how it becomes a psychological game of wits as filtered through this satirical drama in a countryside house. i can't give too much away but the movie builds an uneasy voyeuristic atmosphere that culminates in a devious and wicked ending. the movie won't be for everyone as there are sequences that are difficult to watch due to how uncomfortable they are (even if they are well acted), and scenes involving a bathtub or late night rendezvous in the garden will definitely not be for the squeamish.while saltburn took its time in setting up its story, i was ultimately satisfied with the route it took and the payoff it built up to. the movie features excellent acting across the board especially from its lead barry keoghan who creates one of the most memorably off-putting protagonists i've seen in some time.",8
"817","saltburn"," an emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another","yellowmanreanimated",2024-01-02,"saltburnif one were looking for a definition of tastelessness in cinematic form then i would suggest this effort as a worthy candidate. one should note that it's not particularly worthy in many other respects, with the notable exception of its cinematography and set design; these happen to be the only areas where any true care appears to have been given. for example, there are some arresting uses of shadow, and a variety of visually stimulating locations but there endeth the praise, almost...i also wish to make some positive remarks regarding the performance of rosamund pike, who, to my mind, is an extraordinary actress who hasn't received the filmic exposure that her talents merit. her icy charisma and ability to appear authentic in pretty much any role she undertakes makes her scenes one of the very few pleasures this movie bestows.now onto the problems. firstly, there are the characters. the fact that none of them, except possibly pike's, appears credible is not actually the film's biggest issue; what is much more dissatisfying is that none of the relationships in the film are even marginally convincing. there is not an iota of chemistry between any of the film's characters and that especially applies to the relationship which occupies the film's central focus, that between oliver (barry keoghan) and felix (jacob elordi). now it's easy for one to excuse this by referring to how emotionally dysfunctional oliver and felix (as well as the entirety of felix's family) appear to be, but that would be to miss the point. there isn't even any superficial connection or slight moment of feeling that is generated between oliver and felix which would make you believe that they would bother to utter a morning greeting to each other, never mind about the idea that one would invite the other to his family home. the issue here is not with the acting but with the pacing, the writing and, most significantly, the film's incessantly odious tone.the general misanthropy and nastiness that pervades each scene does not provide any space for the actors to begin to cultivate any sense of fine feeling, or feeling of any kind in fact, for each other. oliver talks about loving and being in love at the beginning of the film but all we are truly presented with is an emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another. there is no emotional texture to draw on, there's no empathy, no joy, no connection, and, thus, there are no stakes. it is simply impossible to care what becomes of any of the characters because the film never allowed any of the characters to become anything in the first place.some of this would've been redeemed if the film was at least humorous. however, i'm afraid that, despite a number of obvious and jarring attempts, humour was never experienced for this viewer. the film was in fact painfully humourless. after all, it's hard to laugh at scenarios which are neither persuasive nor engaging.a word should be spoken on the casting of barry keoghan as the film's protagonist. yes, he was probably miscast. his liverpudlian accent is inconsistent and while he does creepy and arresting extremely well in other films, he possesses none of the oily charm or comfortingly sympathetic demeanour his character requires. matt damon does a much better job in a film with similar themes: the talented mr ripley. he demonstrates a boyish innocence and exuberance alongside an unnatural cunning which makes him endearing and credible and thus draws him into a world to which someone of his station would normally be barred entry. keoghan's oliver, on the other hand, one would not wish to touch with a barge pole, and, if one did, one would run away from him as soon as one had found oneself doing so. however, the casting of keoghan only serves to speak to larger faults with the film. he was unsuitable, it's true, but so was the entire movie.so, what seemed as if it might have been a worthwhile, visceral investigation of the way class and privilege operate in 21st century britain ends up being an ugly, uninteresting, vicious mess. its plot begins as muddy and ends as being ridiculous to the point of insult, so insulting, in fact, that i shan't bother to offer any further comment on it. its sense of place is much weaker than it ought to be, bearing in mind that the film's title is eponymous with it, and its sense of time is utterly arbitrary (was it set around 2006 just so the director got to include her favourite tunes? i can't think of any other reason). thus, the overall effect of the film is to inspire very little outside of boredom and jaded disgust.4/10 (3 points for rosamund and 1 for the pretty colours and sets)",4

"839","saltburn"," well i liked it and thought it disgusting.","wsskfqy",2024-01-11,"i've been reading the reviews and admiring the film aficionados. they certainly know their stuff and have a lot of films to compare it to. they know the actors' previous performances and comparable films. kudos.unless a film is extraordinary, i will have forgotten it and its title within days of watching it. the closest i get to knowing an actor is recognising their face from another film and looking up to seeing what films they played in.coming at it from that perspective, i really liked (and disliked?) this film. i can usually always guess the ""bad guy"" in films. in this film i couldn't tell who was the bad guy.oliver was creepy from the start. he was obviously obsessed with felix. but you couldn't tell if it was hero adoration, brotherly love or lust. felix was nice - for being upperclass. the rest of felix's crowd were snobby and condescending and rude, but felix seemed to genuinely like oliver. whether he liked oliver or whether it was like having an exotic pet was never clear.oliver gets to saltburn and this is where other reviewers seem to get a bit irate. actually, i thought the screenwriting might be pretty accurate. the family was... well a family. a family with far too much money and nothing to do except relieve their boredom. with nothing to do and probably not much exposure to the real world, i can see a summer there being pretty much the way it was. and with little exposure to the real world, oliver's tales of his dreadful life (divulged to felix in confidence) made oliver the exotic he was.naturally, anyone would want to stay there, with his idol, felix, so oliver tries to get in everyone's good graces in whatever way he can, including turning on the charm & seduction skills. which just makes him more creepy.but it's never clear to me why. because he loves felix and wants to be with him? as a brother? a lover? to be him? was the bathtub scene sexual or trying to somehow absorb felix's essence to be more like him?the scene with the sister could be interpreted the same way. was he trying to win her over, help her, or humiliate her?his motive for acceptance was clear, but why he wanted to be accepted never was. so, logically, i at least tentatively accepted that he wanted to be included in the rich lifestyle with felix, as part of felix's life.i really liked felix and thought the character was genuinely nice, if a bit self- absorbed. no, i don't think he was even that. he would notice when felix needed help - and he would help without hesitation. but felix was obviously into girls, so it couldn't have been a partner oliver was angling for. oliver never asked for anything, so that left a hero or a brother.i don't really want to do spoilers, though people may have already seen them.but there are twists that change the direction of the plot so you don't know where it's going at all. i didn't see the twists coming. and every moving we watch, i guess what is going to happen and disgust my partner when it happens.the very end was lame and i don't believe for a minute that the police wouldn't have been called and oliver found out. and even the very very end was just a contradiction. earlier in the movie everyone had seemed impressed with his nude body.parts. the nudity at the end...it wasn't that impressive. i think the dancing through the house scene was to make viewers wonder if he had murdered the snooty butler.that's the mystery we will never get the answer to.it was beautifully filmed, beautiful costumes, great acting (except oliver, but maybe he is really not a creepy guy and worked hard to be so creepy). great settings and good music.yes, there were some ewww moments. but in my opinion, they weren't there just to shock but to keep viewers confused as to who oliver really was and what he was about.",10

2) the film is hilarious in the first half. the audience i saw it with gave choruses of laughter constantly throughout the first half of the film and i really wasn't expecting it to be so funny so that was a pleasant surprise
3) the twist that oliver has been lying the whole time and planned everything to turn out the way it did certainly surprised me. i thought he was going to turn evil but i thought it was going to be caused by the events of the film, rather than the events actually being orchestrated by him the whole time. that final scene of him will also be very memorable for a long time to come
4) the film looks and sounds spectacular. the cinematography, production design, choice of aspect ratio, score etc were all superbnegatives:1) barry keoghan's scouse accent was pretty terrible and honestly distracting for a lot of the film. why couldn't oliver just be irish?2) the film didn't quite stick the landing for me. i think it would've been better if the multiple deaths that occur were scattered throughout the film, rather than them all happening in the last half an hour or so as the film rushes towards a conclusion. oliver goes from being cast out by felix to owning all of saltburn in what seems like far too short a space of time
3) i enjoyed the film very much on a surface level but i didn't really feel like the film said much of note or had much of a message. the themes around posh people who come from old money being rude and spoilt, or about how the quest for money and power can corrupt people, are all quite generic and things we've seen a lot in other films before.",8

"893","saltburn"," overly hyped","rachelehunteray",2024-01-14,"there is a lot to unpack with this film. beginning with the main character, oliver quick, whose personality is drab and generally unlikeable. i understand that this is the point, and that the only reason he is at all interesting as a character is due to the lies he tells and his somewhat inconsistent motivations. i had assumed, in the beginning, that oliver's obsession with felix is due to him falling in love with him or having a crush. this belief was somewhat corroborated by his actions (such as the infamous bathtub and graveyeard scenes). it is entirely possible that this was the case, and oliver only killed felix and his family due to his lies crumbling apart and felix learning the truth. oliver clearly fell in love with the lifestyle that felix and his family had at saltburn and when it became clear that felix was cutting him out of his life for lying to him, oliver clawed desperately at any chance to keep this lifestyle, leading him to kill his only friend.i enjoyed the aspect of having to put together the pieces to understand the whole story, and my interpretation may not be correct, as of course there are some inconsistencies with oliver's motivations, especially towards the end. i also have to make a point that the actors in this film are incredible and portray their characters in a way that is believable and realistic.i did however find this film to be a bit slow, and dialogue heavy. most of what this film relies on is the shock value of many of its more r rated scenes. these scenes of course received a lot of attention online, and were what hyped this film up so much. i probably would not have watched it if it were not for the hype, and these scenes that were so overly hyped where rather tame. (i may be a poor judge on this due to having been chronically online as a child and having read many disturbing fan-fictions online).beyond these points, the ending is a bit unbelievable as you have to believe that he could get away with killing all of these people and somehow gain their inheritance without anyone catching on. not a single person questions felix's or venetia's deaths or makes the connection that oliver is in the middle of this tragedy (someone would make the connection that suddenly the family members are dropping like flies and oliver is the only new thing in their lives). and elspeth's motivations for keeping oliver around after her entire family is dead is so strange, besides why she would make him the sole beneficiary of her inheritance. she only knew him for a couple months before her family died, it's not like she had a close connection with him.overall, it's a bit confusing how everything plays out in the end. there are a few loose ends and questions that remain unanswered, which prevents this film from rating higher than a 6/10.",6

written, and directed by emerald fennell (promising young woman) and having some good names in the cast i was definitely up for it. basically, set in 2006, scholarship student oliver quick (barry keoghan) begins attending oxford university. he struggles to fit in and lacks upper-class sensibilities and the same privileges that many students have from their wealthy parents. he does have conversations with michael gavey (ewan mitchell) who wants to be his friend, but then oliver notices affluent and popular student felix catton (jacob elordi). he eventually strikes up a friendship with felix after helping him when his bicycle wheel has a puncture. felix invites oliver to join him and his group of friends for a drink in the pub, leaving michael who dislikes felix. felix is empathetic to oliver's stories, including his parents having substance abuse problems and mental health issues. felix makes a consistent effort to include him despite disapproval from his other oxford friends, including his american cousin farleigh start (gran turismo's archie madekwe). their friendship grows over the course of the year, but felix becomes annoyed with oliver's constant presence, and they have a small spat. one night, oliver learns that his father has died and shows up distraught at felix's door. felix comforts him, and knowing that he has nowhere to go, invites him to spend the summer at his family's large estate, saltburn. at saltburn, oliver is introduced to felix's parents, sir james (richard e. grant) and lady elspeth (rosamund pike), and his sister venetia (alison oliver). also staying at saltburn are farleigh and family friend poor dear pamela (carey mulligan). oliver quickly wins over felix's family, who are sympathetic to his situation and amused by his lack of social graces. elspeth is fascinated by him as they bond together, and he grows increasingly comfortable at saltburn. for a few nights, oliver sees venetia in a drunken state wandering the grounds. one night, he meets with her in the house garden, and after some conversation performs oral sex on her. farleigh witnessed this and goads oliver about telling felix about it. when confronted by felix, oliver lies that it was venetia who initiated the act, and he immediately cuts her out from the family. meanwhile, oliver's obsession with felix grows stronger. one night, he watches felix masturbate in the bath, and he drinks the bath water and licks the plug after felix leaves. tensions between oliver and farleigh reach breaking point when during a karaoke party they have a flirtatious moment, and farleigh tricks oliver into performing ""rent"" by pet shop boys in front of the family. later that night, oliver goes into farleigh's room, gives him a handjob while also threatening him. the next morning, farleigh is forced to leave saltburn after it is said that he was trying to steal valuables from the house. later, while oliver is with felix and elspeth, she casually mentions that pamela has died, apparently committing suicide. as the summer draws to a close, elspeth and james plan an elaborate party to celebrate oliver's birthday. the morning of the party, felix surprises oliver after organising to visit his estranged mother paula (dorothy atkinson), answering a call from her on his phone. oliver resists, but felix insists that he try to repair their relationship. however, arriving at his mother's house, oliver's background stories have been fabricated: his father jeff (shaun dooley) is alive, and his parents live in a respectable upper-middle-class suburb. felix is angered by oliver's deception and wants him to leave saltburn after the party. during the extravagant celebrations, oliver encounters farleigh, who reminds him that he will always be an outsider to their lifestyle. hundreds of guests are there to sing ""happy birthday to you"" but it is apparent many can't remember oliver's name. desperate to reconcile with felix, oliver follows him into saltburn's large hedge maze. he interrupts felix having sex with a female guest who runs away, he feels hurt and confusion over oliver's actions. oliver tries to reason and perhaps flirt with him, but ultimately felix rejects him and says he needs professional help. the next morning, felix is found dead in the middle of the maze. during a tense family lunch, oliver mentions that the night before farleigh was taking and handing out drugs, implying a possible connection to felix's death. james banishes farleigh from saltburn and cuts off all his financial support. after felix's funeral, the cattons question oliver's presence, despite this, elspeth insists that he may stay at saltburn. oliver mourns felix desperately, returning to his grave, taking off his trousers and underwear, and penetrating the soil. one night, venetia is in the bath distraught and inebriated. she accuses oliver of disintegrating her family. he tries to seduce her again, but she is disturbed by his behaviour and rebuffs him. the following morning, venetia is found dead in the bath, apparently suicide after slitting her wrists. james, despondent and suspicious of oliver's continuing presence at saltburn, asks him to leave. oliver repeatedly insists that he cannot leave elspeth in her hysterical state. but james realises oliver is manipulative and furiously bribes him to disappear and never contact them again. years later, oliver is in a caf√© reading a newspaper with an article that james has died. there, he has a chance encounter with elspeth who is delighted to see him. she insists that he return with her to saltburn, having not been there in some time herself. they spend several months together, but elspeth suddenly falls fatally ill. elspeth is in hospital on life support, and oliver is there recounting all his actions. he reveals he had been responsible for all the tragedies that took place at saltburn. oliver deliberately punctured felix's bike tyre in order to meet him, he poisoned felix in the hedge maze after final rejection, he subtly manipulated venetia into cutting and killing herself, and he fabricated the email that led to farleigh leaving the estate. finally, it is revealed that he planned his reacquaintance with elspeth and that she subsequently left all the financial assets to him, including ownership of saltburn. after all his confessions, oliver forcefully removes the tube supplying oxygen for elspeth, killing her. now officially the owner of saltburn and the catton fortune, oliver dances naked around the mansion to ""murder on the dancefloor"" by sophie ellis-bextor, and the death stones with all family names are displayed on a sideboard. also starring paul rhys as duncan the butler, reece shearsmith as professor ware, lolly adefope as lady daphne, sadie soverall as annabel, and millie kent as india. keoghan is compelling as the awkward young man who lingers in the mansion, elordi plays the charming obnoxious rich boy well, pike steals all her scenes with her great one-liners, grant is reliable as always, madekwe is good at being hateful, and mulligan's cameo is welcome. what starts as a crush and wanting to fit in with the rich people goes in a dark direction you don't expect, it follows a familiar format where the wealthy eccentric characters are all unlikeable, it is funny when it needs to be, amusingly cringey and uncomfortable in moments, and the twists work relatively well, and the final scene and song choice is genius, it is certainly a memorable and worthwhile black comedy psychological thriller. very good!",7

"908","oppenheimer"," i wish i could say i had a blast","juststone",2023-07-22,"i think i will be in the minority here when i say, i think christopher nolan missed the mark with this film. let's first talk about what worked: ""oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. i watched it in imax 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 dts-hd master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. the acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. i also don't think i need to say anything further about nolan as a filmmaker; he's like martin scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a nolan film, in terms of style and tone.now onto the problems: nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. having not done any earlier research on oppenheimer's life purposefully, so i can go into the film with a blank slate and let nolan do the work for me, i felt disappointed that i had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. normally i don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping oppenheimer on the manhattan project.my other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. the film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about oppenheimer's work on the manhattan project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. one of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. although nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why oppenheimer decided to move forward with the manhattan project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.this is also true for moments in the film that i wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. the actual dropping of both bombs in hiroshima and nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. so in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. for films of this stature, sometimes i imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. i tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once i realized these moments were not included in the film, i felt that there was much more left to the imagination.lastly, the sound design was much better than ""interstellar"" or nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. i could hear the dialogue in ""oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when i couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. that's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, i just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in nolan's filmography.this film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""the prestige"", ""the dark knight"", ""inception"" and ""interstellar"", as some of nolan's greatest works. but i can't help but feel like nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. much like p. t. anderson with ""licorice pizza"", and wes anderson for ""astroid city"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. nolan i feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. this is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. but as a fan of steven spielberg, stanley kubrick, david lynch, and ridley scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, i feel nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",7
"909","oppenheimer"," superior filmmaking and historical storytelling","ferguson-6",2023-07-22,"greetings again from the darkness. as pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. world war ii was lumped in with wwi, the civil war, and the revolutionary war. there were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. as we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. filmmaker-extraordinaire christopher nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of j robert oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. what we see is quite frightening.prepare yourself. at a full three hours in length, nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. it demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""american prometheus: the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer"", written by kai bird and martin sherman. the end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. the key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.the morality of the manhattan project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of oppenheimer. we get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. some know cillian murphy from ""peaky blinders"" or as scarecrow in nolan's batman movies. i'd also recommend a couple of murphy's underrated gems: free fire (2016) and red eye (2005). it's hard to overstate how spot on murphy is as oppenheimer. he lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. we never once question whether this is oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the los alamos lab and the father of the atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in.""
once major groves (oscar winner matt damon) recruits oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? this weighs heavily on oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. it's also clear that while oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. this is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. oppenheimer was jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. this included his love interest, psychiatrist jean tatlock (the fabulous rising star florence pugh), his wife kitty (emily blunt), and his brother frank (dylan arnold).the teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in los alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. this culminates in the stunning sequence of the trinity test near alamogordo. a blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. the initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for hiroshima and nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending wwii, less than four years after the bombing of pearl harbor by the japanese (never mentioned here).the bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. oppenheimer became a national hero and his time magazine cover proves it. a meeting with president harry s truman (oscar winner gary oldman sporting a missouri accent) doesn't go well, as oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. lewis strauss (oscar winner robert downey jr) is a key player as chairman of the us atomic energy commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.multiple timelines are covered. there is the background information on oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the los alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and strauss' senate confirmation hearing for secretary of commerce. all of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. among the familiar faces not already named above are: oscar winner kenneth branagh as danish physicist neils bohr, oscar winner rami malek as experimental physicist david hill, oscar winner casey affleck as military security advisor boris pash, tom conti as albert einstein, benny safdie, dane dehaan, jason clarke, josh hartnett, david krumholtz, matthew modine, alden ehrenreich, scott grimes, tony goldwyn, james d'arcy, james urbaniak, olivia thirlby, james remar, and (nolan regular) david dastmalchian.the film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. my favorite line in the film is aimed at oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" the stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.cillian murphy is a shoe-in for a best actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. it's nice to see robert downey jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a best supporting actor nomination. florence pugh and emily blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. pugh's role is limited but memorable, while blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.christopher nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. his use of black & white film for strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the oppenheimer viewpoint. impressively, while there are some visual effects, nolan has stated that no cgi was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. ludwig goransson's (oscar winner for black panther) score packs an emotional punch, and jennifer lame's editing is excellent and vital. lastly, cinematographer (and regular nolan collaborator) hoyte van hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. this is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. these types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.opened nationally july 21, 2023.",9
"910","oppenheimer"," no doubt a well made story, but overall, was just boring","ryan-beauchesne",2023-08-13,"maybe my expectations were off slightly. this was a character study into oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the a bomb. i was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. instead its just dramatic closeups of opp's troubled face. but i feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. it felt exceedingly anticlimactic.and really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.as another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. there is nothing visually interesting or exciting.",6
"911","oppenheimer"," an unpopular opinion from a die-hard nolan fan","feastmode",2023-07-21,"christopher nolan is my favorite director of all time. he has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. it's absurd how much joy he's given me. i consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. the technical aspects are all up to the nolan standards. the acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. the ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing emily blunt and the soon-to-be oscar winner (hopefully) downy jr.subjectively... i hate to say it but i found it boring. and it's not because it's too long. i think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. the reason i was bored is because i was fairly uninterested and not invested. it did not evoke emotions, something nolan normally does better than anyone. i even checked the time at one point, something i never imagined i'd say about a nolan movie.while it was still a treat to see this in imax with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. part of why i love nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that i've never seen before or could possibly imagine. not the case here.this isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. but i'm begging nolan to reunite with hans zimmer. no one is on his level. the musical scores for inception, interstellar and the dark knight trilogy are iconic. they are stuck in your head on the way home. you add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. again, not the case here.i want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. i don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. a movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like memento and following). but a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.if you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. for me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. i'm endlessly sad that i have to wait another three years for a new nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening thursday imax 7/20/2023)",5
"912","oppenheimer"," overall a disappointing experience.","whiterabbitdave",2023-07-28,"although the time passed quickly, ultimately, oppenheimer has left me disappointed. the problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. both of those stories are depicted well, nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. however, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. the film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white imax film stock.",NA
"913","oppenheimer"," nolan at his best!","shivamkanodia-94992",2023-07-19,"as vfx and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. oppenheimer is thus a culmination of nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. it's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.the cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from hans zimmer's profound work in interstellar. nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. the movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste fast and furious flick or a marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.because this isn't a film or a flick, this is cinema.",9
"914","oppenheimer"," fission. fusion. oscars.","pjtaylor-96-138044",2023-07-31,"everybody involved with the production of 'oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. there isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. the writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. this film is exactly what it was always intended to be. if it doesn't clean up at the oscars, i'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, i'll be very surprised.however, that doesn't mean it's perfect. more specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). it isn't even nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the manhattan project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with florence pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. how he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). that's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). one of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). that this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of nolan's directorial decisions. that's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in new mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. it's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. the sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. for how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.the film is a veritable who's who of hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. there are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. emily blunt, matt damon, benny safdie, tom conti, josh hartnett, jason clarke and david krumholtz are highlights, but robert downey jr. is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. cillian murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. if he doesn't win the best leading actor oscar, there's something seriously wrong.even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. on the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. the pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. it tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. it's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. it helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. it knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. it creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. it might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.in the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. i can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. it isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. it's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. i'm not pining to watch it again and i don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. it's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.*i definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the oscars. who do you think i am? werner herzog?",8

"922","oppenheimer"," pearls before swine","shanayneigh",2023-08-04,"first of all, i love christoper nolan's work. he's the only director whose films i always see in a cinema. but it's clear that he's is now so powerful that no one has the guts to tell him no. he's almost the stephen king of film making these days, with the end results too often overly long and meandering. perhaps my nolan cinema-first policy will end after oppenheimer.i remember how the filmmakers in the special features to the godfather part ii (1974) discussed that it took a long time for them in editing to figure out how often they should switch between the different time periods. clearly no one bothered to ponder this question in the editing of oppenheimer. we jump backwards and forwards in time so frequently that no scene has time to breathe. this movie manages the almost impossible. it's simultaneously rushed and plodding.nolan falls into his regular trap of telling instead of showing.we're told by other characters that oppenheimer's a genius. the evidence we've been shown to support this claim is him dropping a beaker in class and not much else. compare this to a beautiful mind (2001) where they try to illustrate how the mind of that main character works. in oppenheimer that's substituted with blurry macro photography.two hours into the movie we are also told by one character that oppenheimer is a womanizer. at this point he has been shown to have had two women. again, show us, don't tell us.filming the entire movie in imax was truly casting pearls before swine. the huge format added nothing (except production costs i imagine). it reminded me of the hateful eight (2015). i was so excited that tarantino was going to shoot a western on 65mm, a perfect format for glorious vistas. and then they were outside for like the first five minutes of the movie and spent the rest inside a little log cabin. the same holds true for oppenheimer, which is 95% dialogue scenes in tight quarters making the imax format completely and utterly useless.as for the explosion of the bomb, which occurs around the two-hour mark, i have to say that it was quite underwhelming. mad respect for nolan's ambition to not use cg, but perhaps sometimes it's justified. the explosion in the opening of apocalypse now (1979) and at the end of blown away (1994) looked more impressive than the one in oppenheimer, which is covered mostly in closeups anyway.the supposed reveals in the end about strauss' being the secret puppet master behind oppenheimer's faux trial and the contents of the conversation between the latter and einstein were, in the case of the former telegraphed so far in advance one can only wonder why nolan treated it as a reveal, and as for the latter the only appropriate response in a shrugging of the shoulders. for anyone with the slightest bit of knowledge of the atomic bomb program, einstein's views are well known, and we had already seen plenty of examples of strauss' vanity in the preceding three hours. but no nolan movie without an attempt at a plot twist, amirite??as for the results of the bombs in hiroshima and nagasaki, we are shown nothing. some abstract numbers are discussed, and the only visual reference we get is of oppenheimer's face watching a newsreel. for anyone interested in an account written only a year after the bombing i would recommend hiroshima by john hersey (available for free online in the new yorker). or better yet, visit the hiroshima peace memorial museum which is outstanding.funnily enough, this movie is carefully toeing the line of decades long american propaganda where the bomb is presented as an alternative to invasion, which is claimed to have saved tens of thousands of american lives (by now the figure mentioned if often in the millions). i would urge anyone interested in this to read hiroshima nagasaki by paul ham which is an extensive study of the development of the nuclear bomb program. the bomb was never an alternative to invasion, it was a complement. and the japanese leadership didn't even consider the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki. the reason they surrendered to the americans was because the soviet union opened up a front against japan which threatened not only their colonies in manchuria and korea, but also hokkaido in japan proper.",4

the actor who plays oppenheimer is very strange looking and that also took some of my attention. i am the last to judge but he's just very weird with eyes and a face that always looks surprised.anyway, i wasn't enjoying it all that much until it got near the ending when rami malek shows up and the point of it suddenly clicked into place.it's not so much a science history movie as a political drama. duh.because it is theoretically about history and a very interesting time and event, i should have just loved this movie, and i don't know what it was that made it such a chore to watch other than it told much of its story via what happens in two hearings (one public, one private). perhaps i am getting old and grumpy.as it got to the end and the ""clicking into place"" happened, i thought i should watch it again.. but at 3 hours? i doubt that i will. it is a long movie, to be sure, but weirdly the development of the bomb seems pretty fast. there's a disconnect there.it is worth mentioning robert downy jr at this point. he's wonderful as the ""heavy"". i miss him in the mcu movies. in fact, i miss those glory days of mcu movies... thor and ironman and all the rest.you don't know what you have until it's gone.",NA

after sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) i can understand why ""oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.i saw this in the lounge/gold class so i can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended imax format and for the first time ever kodak invented black and white imax film just for this movie.this is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.as j. robert oppenheimer states in this movie, ""i don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. but i know the nazis can't.""

"931","oppenheimer"," ""property is theft""... are you kidding me?","schlomo-jones",2023-07-21,"i was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. the overall structure is a convoluted mess. nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for interstellar or inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.firstly, is it worth seeing? yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. it's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. it looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe cgi didn't look good. either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in imax, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.much of the film focuses on the personality of j. robert oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. cillian murphy's portrayal is fantastic. however, the plot focuses heavily on the mccarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the atomic energy commission. of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.the follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named lewis strauss, potrayed by robert downey, jr. this is where the plot gets lost. without knowing all the details of strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. this part of the story dragged on forever.now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. it's true that oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. however, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point oppenheimer to different people.i also found it odd that nolan decided to include einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.i also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by florence pugh. they start talking about marx's capital, how she's read all three volumes. he says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. massive facepalm moment.anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or marx, would know that ""property is theft"" is a famous slogan from pierre joseph-proudhon, an anarchist who karl marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and marxists have not seen eye to eye. no marxist, let alone a cpusa member in the 1930's, would be misquoting marx with proudhon. this was either a glaring oversight, or deliberate trolling on the part of nolan. i'm not sure.either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his dark knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet tory, so i don't trust him to portray oppeheimer's saga accurately. i found a lot of similar issues with aaron sorkin's dreadful lucille ball biopoc. the idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as na√Øve youthful indiscretions. all the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.there are a lot of other issues that i could talk about how general leslie groves, portrayed by matt damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of oppenheimer. by some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and nazis were in the us at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). of course groves pushed through oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. don't take these biopics at face value as real history.",6

""oppenheimer"" could have easily told the story in a 2 hours 20 minutes to 2 hours 40 minutes timeframe. movies like ""the imitation game"" and ""bridge of spies"" did so quite successfully.while nolan doesn't seem to prescribe to the television format, i would say that, at least for me, that ""oppenheimer"" would have worked better as a three or four part miniseries (""john adams"" comes to mind) than a movie.i have never been a christopher nolan sycophant or fanboy, but i do appreciate him and his dedication to moviemaking, which for him is clearly an art form and he treats it as such. which is admirable and praiseworthy especially since he is not wrong in doing so. his effort to always push the cinematic boundaries in clever, imaginative and intelligent ways are to be admired as is his dedication to cinema. no doubt.it's just that oftentimes he is too clever for his own good and all too often he gets lost in the weeds...where audiences can't or won't always follow, as is for me the case with ""oppenheimer"". a movie still has to be entertaining and engaging. therefore, sometimes ""simpler is better"" could work more efficiently and satisfactorily even for a director of nolan's pedigree.",5
"935","oppenheimer"," best movie of the year and one of the great war movies of all time.","johndesando",2023-07-21,"""they won't fear it until they understand it. and they won't understand it until they've used it. theory will take you only so far."" j. robert oppenheimer (cillian murphy)the ""it"" is the atomic bomb, for which oppenheimer was called ""the father."" writer/director christopher nolan has adapted the authoritative 2005 bio ""american prometheus: the triumph and tragedy of j. robert oppenheimer by kai bird and martin j. sherwin. nolan, surveying oppenheimer's life and especially his leadership of the manhattan project, has crafted a harrowing story deeply embedded in our history as oppenheimer developed the two atomic bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki that helped end wwii.yet, this film is not really about the making of the bombs-it is rather about the turmoil surrounding oppenheimer with such weighty questions about killing tens of thousands of civilians with the bombs, whether that would force japan to surrender, and whether or not he was a communist.nolan keeps it favorable to history only now and then emphasizing interactions that cannot be verified such as conversations with his wife, the alcoholic kitty (emily blunt), and his mistress, jean tatlock (florence pugh). murphy underplays masterfully oppenheimer's struggles while he carefully considers each challenge, like the scientist he plays. just as upending are the anti -communist attacks that dogged him through his professional life.along with cinematographer hoyte van hoytema, nolan captures the vast loneliness of the new mexico desert using 65 mm film projected in 70mm. as in dunkirk (2017), nolan uses the process to mirror the magnitude of the subject and the intellectual excitement following einstein's 1915 publishing of his theory of general relativity-it's the chalkboards that announce mankind's precipitate changes and provide the intellectual excitement eclipsing even that of the bomb itself.nolan's mixing black and white and then color helps to relieve the monotony for some of the film's three hours but mostly shows the upheaval of his life, especially the last third in black and white, where the antisemitic red scare threatened his legacy as scientist and humanitarian.his turn as critic of nuclear war toward the end of his life was not without attendant compromise of his achievements. perhaps his thoughts as he saw the first test mushroom cloud said it all about how his research for the bomb changed him and the world:""now i am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" ""oppenheimer"" is the best movie of the year so far and one of the great war movies of all time.",NA
"936","oppenheimer"," people who change the world like oppenheimer can't not be complicated","christopher-cole83",2023-07-29,"history is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. the same goes for people like j. robert oppenheimer. in learning about world war ii and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing i remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. that however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. this was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.when the trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, i do believe that fundamentally changed him. wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.what this picture does really well is show oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of joseph mccarthy and the cold war. rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. i believe nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions.",9
"937","oppenheimer"," no cgi here, just good writing and very good acting","theony13",2023-08-16,"oppenheimer was the most anticipated movie of the year for me. i wanted to see a thought provoking and visually stunning biography about a very controversial man, whose history i didn't actually knew before watching the movie but knew about as ""the father of the atomic bomb"". and well, i mostly got what i wanted, except the only problem is that i would have wanted that the journey getting there would have been more smooth and sharply written. i will start with the negative parts and finish with the positive since that mirrors somewhat how the movie flows.the movie is about oppenheimer's life and that is one of the problems here. there is too much crammed into the 3 hours of runtime and not all of them seem to be useful for the movie's plot to be emphasized towards the end where it all comes full circle. the movie begins with oppenheimer at a hearing which we later find out it was rigged from the start, but then it quickly jumps to lewis strauss' interview for his entrance into the congress or senate of america.. whatever... after that the movie depicts - and that done very choppy - oppenheimer's life starting from student life and towards his work at the manhattan project. now, the problem is that the scenes with him as a student aren't more relevant than the idea that he hates practical work in physics which it's only payoff might be the fact that he recruits a team of scientists who do most of the practical work. but that didn't impact me whatsoever since the fact that he is still considered the father of the atomic bomb and the man who gave the world the power to self-destruct was developed more in the scenes showing his later years and involvment in the manhattan project. the fact that these scenes are also very choppy is also not helping too much, since you have to be 100% focused on screen and even then it's kinda hard to catch everything that's happening and why is that important. i think oppie's flashbacks from his youth as student really don't add up too much to the film aside from the fact mentioned above and aside from the fact that he met some scientists he mentions them later in the movie. next, the other gripe i had were relationships in this movie. although his relationship with jane was somewhat build up by 2 scenes, they quickly have sex and then oppenheimer reads the legendary quote ""and now i am become death the destroyer of worlds"" from a book in the middle of the sex scene. and what pisses me off even more is that he doesn't give that quote never ever in the movie during an interview. and i don't mean it to be an interview that replicates the real oppenheimer's legendary interview when he delivers that quote. there are many interviews in this movie where oppenheimer after hiroshima and nagasaki delivers monologues that are both grateful and warning at the same time. more on the second later... next, is his marriage with kitty, which is again rushed. they literally have one scene together, then they kiss and next they have kids. the problem is that you don't feel the relationship and what that did in a way to him. it's like an event that is addressed and that's that. and that's also the case for his relationship with jane which could have even been not included in the movie and the movie would still have tons of scenes and interactions of him with communists to frame him as a possible communist mole at the end. the last thing that bothered me is that kitty drinks and becomes tired of taking care of their child. they give their baby to his brother who was a former communist and that's the end of that sub-plot. like the only reason for that being in the movie is to support the idea of oppenheimer having tight connections to communists. but again there are tons of other things that frame him better than this. like, there is no reason other than interaction with communists for robert and kitty to give their child to his brother for care.but aside from the bad things i didn't like i would like to point out the things that i liked. and funny enough they become more obvious the further you go into the movie. especially if you get pass the first 30-40 minutes of choppy flashbacks the movie turns up to 10 maybe even 11 towards the trinity test. first, what i liked was that the movie has a balanced way of dealing with the physics of an atomic bomb. you get enough to realize that these guys are physicists but at the same time not too much to get to the point where it's too hard to understand what they are talking about. and once you get to oppenheimer finding out that in germany the nucleus was broken first, is where the movie comes alive. from there everything seems pretty clear towards the building of the atomic bomb and towards the end of the movie. the performances are also top notch. the highlight must be cillian murphy who not even for a second did i see as the actor. i always saw oppenheimer, which speaks volumes as to how marvelous he played the controversial scientist. next is robert downey jr who in my opinion is at his best out of everything i've seen him in. emily blunt is also great especially in the interrogation scene. also, her dynamic with oppenheimer is great and there are points in which he seems the weaker character compared to her, but that is only intended from oppenheimer's part who wanted to play the martyr card, unlike 80% of today's movies in which every male character is weak, dumb or incompetent. however i digress... every performance was great in this movie, even the small parts played by some crazy well-known actors like casey affleck or gary oldman. the trinity scene was probably one of the best scenes i've ever seen in a cinema - right up there with the docking scene from interstellar. the build-up to it, the dialogue, the rehearsals beforehand and the detonation itself are sublime. and then the best thing is that after you see the bomb going off there is dead silence which makes you realize what just happened and by the time you do, the shock wave hits you and you come back down to earth. what i loved was the fact that we see inside oppenheimer's head from the beginning and we see him transforming from a guy who dreams atoms interactions to a guy who sees everyone possibly blowing up or melting from a bomb going off. and honestly by the end i really felt for oppenheimer and i really understood how this man thought the world would destroy itself using his invention. and that is also helped by the numerous interviews he is shown to give during the movie in which he also speaks about the achievement they did at los alamos as well as the dangers of nuclear war. this really hammers down the idea of a man terrified of his own invention and of a man that will live the rest of his life with the horror of thinking that the world will end itself using his invention. and if that wasn't enough the scene between him and einstein at the end hit that much harder. you realized why all the interrogation stuff mattered in the whole movie. we see how the politicians will use him at first, discredit him when he will not play how they want and then towards the end of his life will come back to him in honor but doing that not really for him but for themselves. i was left completely stunned and devastated and the final shot of oppenheimer having almost tears in his eyes and imagining a world blowing up. that was the final poignant moment in this character's journey in this film. also, contrary to popular opinion i really liked the last hour of the movie. all the court room drama really tied up everything that was set in motion at the beginning. it resolved everything in a very suited, clever and deserved fashion, offering justice but also mercy towards its characters. last but not least are the technical aspects. all of them are pitch perfect but oh my god is the score incredible. there is already ""can you hear the music"" floating around the internet as one of the best songs ever but that is only at the beginning of the movie. the entire film is scored perfectly by ludwig g√∂ransson who made possibly his best score yet, and i hope he gets an oscar because this is a powerful haunting and musicaly rich score that will leave you humming it long after the movie ends.still, having said all of that, i do think this is not nolan's best film and it's probably his worst film yet, but that doesn't really mean much since this is still a great film. i am and will be a nolan fan but even i have to admit that i have seen lately some zack snyder level of self indulgence at nolan and he does struggle to write human relationships and shape characters that make you feel towards them something. like for example there is no overarching message with oppenheimer as a character. the only thing that you are left to ponder is the tragedy of him having to live with the image of a world burning from nuclear bombs in his head. it is impactful but it isn't something you see it being shaped throughout the movie in his character. so in that regard i understand people that felt nothing or thought the movie was empty. for me the movie worked and it worked best as a courtroom drama about how oppenheimer is treated after he delivered possibly the greatest weapon in human history. it also worked as a powerful depiction of the destruction that the atomic bomb was capable and the effect it has on the humans that invented it or built it. overall it was a breath of fresh air from all the bright colors, light hearted marvel style movies we got nowadays which are also over-exaggerating with non-stop humor. because that is all that is left for humans to enjoy in these days right? well i whole heartedly support more grounded movies that tackle difficult historical periods or tough themes. and oppenheimer is one of those movies. 9/10.",9
"938","oppenheimer"," i'll bet that's jack quaid as richard feynman playing the bongo drum","boblipton",2023-07-23,"i am a fan of christopher nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. covering almost forty years, from oppenheimer as a student in england and germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than i can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. and like watching penn & teller do the cup-and-ball trick, i see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than i recognized robert downey jr. as lewis strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece.it's early to start predicting oscar nominations, and nolan's pictures have been slighted in the past. however, one nomination i feel confident about is that luisa abel will be nominated for make-up, as she ages her characters through their lifetimes.nolan's movies encompass big themes and often distorted views of time. this would seem to render them too highbrow for popularity yet they are popular. they challenge the audience without insulting him. they don't indulge in bafflegab to offer a fig leaf to their nonsense, but explain things in terms he can understand (i omit tenet from this discussion), just as the scientists use language they can understand. nolan as a film maker is the type of craftsman i try to be as a writer: engaging, entertaining, making his points without talking down, and leaving the audience a little happier and more knowledgeable than when he started. my only dissatisfaction with this movie is that he is so much better at his craft than i at mine.",10
"939","oppenheimer"," oppenheimers victims are barely acknowledged","stevenmcglinchey",2023-09-01,"for every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki died. if you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of hiroshima and nagasaki. for this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed bbc drama documentary hiroshima (2005.)
that film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond.the oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past that part of the horror story.oppenheimer is a well made biopic of a man, or to be more accurate - a ghoul. a man who wilfully, along with his los alamos buddies, messed round with plutonium, mined from thousands of uranium mines to build a weapon that would annihilate the civilian populations of two cities and possibly one day humanity.what's good: a fast paced immersive movie into the allegedly tortured mind of the director of the manhattan project j. robert oppenheimer. his team delivered a fission bomb to the us airforce at the cost of $2 billion dollars. the lead up to and the culmination of the trinity test contains the movie's strongest moments.what's bad: the story of the creation of the worst imaginable weapon and the consequences of its use is virtually skimmed over in favour of the mccarthy era security hearing of oppenheimer in 1954, which resulted in his losing his 'security clearance.'
the hearing, the movie shows, was secretly instigated by levi strauss, the director of the post war atomic energy commission. strauss who had taken over the manhattan project in 1946, never got on with oppenheimer, who apposed the development of the hydrogen bomb.while it's an interesting story, it decidedly distracts from the real horror of what happened to the victims of hiroshima and nagasaki and descends - somewhat - into yet another attempt to justify the actions and subsequent hegemony of the united states. they even manage to name check jfk near the end for a little old fashioned jingoism.it's a good movie. but it would be timely for netflix to stream when the wind blows (1986) and the day after (1983) as well as the aforementioned bbc hiroshima (2005)",8
"940","oppenheimer"," a long slog through history, but blows up the quality of the genre","rgkarim",2023-07-21,"likes:the presentation:
-oppenheimer had a lot happen in his life, and this movie does its best to capture it without being too historical
-nolan takes the underlying a story, a case, and uses it as a guiding line that helps tie together to the big parts and summarize his life. it works, and presents the evidence in this visual style and storytelling that works.-there is some hollywood mixing that might stretch the truth, but it's balanced enough that i can't say it was annoying in conveying the struggles of this time period.-the result is a historical biography that moves, very important for a three hour period, and found myself engaged to listen to the tales of the father of quantum physics in america.the acting:
-no surprise, this is going to be a contender for best acting, and rightfully so given the performances presented in this movie.-every single person, big or small, has this atmosphere that works. it blends hollywood dramatic theater with biography and conveys relationships, tensions, and dynamics that are closer to the pulse of reality than some other dynamics.-the tension of the case is conveyed in everyone, and i loved this buildup of so many sides on this issue and it worked well.-damon is great, his range of acting continues to impress me and the way he has such control over character nuances. this pushed him to several different levels and found his engagement and evolution, quite awesome.-blunt started out okay for me, one of my top actresses feeling a little sidelined and conveying an okay character. the later acts show her style though and i loved watching this woman deliver these lines and emotions with such a top notch level of acting that spices up acts 3 and 4.-murphy is the one to keep eyes on though. the man's complexity has evolved way past red eye, his conveyance of mannerisms, quirks, obsessions, and genius creepy and yet entrapping. he plays well with everyone, hits these roles of a changing career on high cylinders, and makes a historical character intriguing to look more into.-all in all, this is probably one of the stronger qualities of the film, but there is more to dive into.the visuals/cinematography:
-nolan is all about telling stories on a lot of levels, and visual sensations are a key component.-oppenheimer has fantastic camera work, using angles, lighting, technology, and planning to find the optimum angle to give you the best of the situation.-the changing of filters for various parts adds this nuance that gives subtle changes, adding emotion and messages the likes i did not expect, while keeping me awake.-and the fact that it actively adapts to the character with hyper focus and realism, while still adding touches of grainy visuals of the times, is homage paid well.the sound:
-thank the lord, this movie got the sound right and proved editing can still be done.-nolan's team gives crisp dialog, easy to understand and listen, without getting drowned out by other sounds.-it's the imax worthy piece of it, the musical scores adding that emotion going to do well on top notch speakers, while the resounding booms and other effects get an added life.-another level of immersion, the movie really used the budget well to make sure you get all the information you need to follow, and perhaps cast your own vote before the end.the story pieces chosen:
-for the most part, oppenheimer's legacy is tied to the infamous device he crafted, but does that make the most interesting character for all?-nolan seems to agree it doesn't, and like a good autobiography, finds snippets of his life to ingrain and add a bit more of the ""good stuff"" to enhance the character.-facets of his life come into play at times, adding extra tests and impasses for him to work around while coordinating so much.-friendships, relationships, and philosophies conveyed to some extent (though accurately i have no idea) that gives you more than just the science laden man you might think.-it works well for me and should help broaden the audience who will see that movie.-and to have details in all these components, both invention and non-invention, are finding a balance that is surprisingly well, though not as perfect as some might say.the message:
-outside of batman, nolan's work is often very much ingrained in symbolism, morals, and some assessments of characters that works.-and oppenheimer is loaded with that. a fantastic movie that tests the fortitude of the human emotion and make us question how much we should push the boundaries.-while a tad heavy at times with some lines, the movie is beautifully done to really show the horrors of progress and the good and bads that we must sometimes weigh.-it adds extra edge to the movie, and again gives you that amazing investment for your time, which again works super well with everything.dislikes:more character balance:
-the movie has a lot of names tied to it, and i won't lie that they aren't all in the movie to the same degree, so don't be surprised if your favorite is on and off in less than 30 minutes.-i mentioned blunt before, but that evens out, but others, you have to be ready to hold tight to the moments they are in, and dive into books more with their engagement.-i would have liked more balance, integration, conveyance, and a few more moments that i wanted to see were absent. inclusion would have bloated this film more, but a part of me would have loved more time with several characters.the presentation is odd at first:
-walking into the movie i asked if i had missed something.-the opening is very interesting and you have to be ready for that growth pain of the unique presentation, as you quickly go through his early life during this opening case.-about 20 minutes in, the movie evens out and i was able to understand the presentation style and where we were at. so if you can wade through the confusion at the start, you'll be fine.the run time:
-it's 3 hours and at times it feels like it when you hit the transition moments that are odd, which slow down the pace.-while most of the stuff is then fine, the last twenty to thirty minutes are the slow parts of the movie and felt the longest. it's important, but... it just feels bloated, long, and very drawn out, that i was ready to go.-true it was hour 5 of a movie, but there were other facets more detail would be welcomed for me, like projects and bombs, instead of seeing this complex endgame. but... it's symbolic and fitting to the story so that helps blunt the time dilation the final effects have.the audience entertainment?-perhaps the last thing to bring to the audience is that this movie requires you to pay attention.-for those looking for entertainment and getting away, without the realism and politics of the world, this movie can be tough to engage with.-the flashbacks and paying attention, keeping track of the names, it's a lot and this might just get in the way of the enjoyment aspect for some, especially when paired with the run time.-thus, the movie is good and truly an artistic wonder that sticks out from others, but a general audience may be bored and dock scores if they don't know what they are getting.the verdict:
oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies of the year if not in a long time. nolan proves once again that there is a medium of art and entertainment, and i was very engaged for much of this historical drama thanks to his directorial guidance. fantastic acting with a stunning visual and audio collection bring history to life, and getting us engaged in a turning point of human culture. it's a summary of a tremendous man's life, and though it has some areas i want more of, did a nice job covering bases, with a little hollywood spectacle added. true, it's a marathon and it isn't easy to hit if you are coming off a long day, one of the worst parts about it, but the pace and content are engaging to keep track of if you are looking for a deeper biographical film. some character balance and pacing could be a tad smoothed out and cut down sure (maybe a director's cut), and it might not be the entertaining escape, but the movie really is worth the merit and praise for me given what it achieves in this genre. teaching those lessons, with an engaging cast of characters, at a pace and timing that feels mostly complete without too much bloated feeling. thus, my scores are:biography/drama/history: 9.5
movie overall: 9.0, maybe an 8.5 at the least.",9

"944","oppenheimer"," it's okay but i'll be the bad guy that will reject this as a masterpiece most people claim it to be","iamrockas",2023-07-23,"like many this weekend, i spend it in a pact theatre watching one of the most hyped-up movies this summer. unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. if it weren't for this, i could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - i counted six instances before they left around the time jean tatlock died. i didn't check the time so i can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.the movie itself didn't meet up my expectations but i still managed to enjoy it. does that mean my expectations are too high or did the movie simply not appeal to me? well, let's try to answer that by discussing for whom this movie is - in other words, what's the prototype of the viewer this movie is build for. i think it would be best to start by quickly describing what the movie is about but here we meet our first challenge - i'm not confident enough to say that this movie is primarily about oppenheimer and his quest to build the atomic bomb. no, this movie is more of a court drama with a backstory presented in stretched flashback and an epilogue under a veil of overwhelming drama but the movie also has nods to multiple conspiracy theories that were popular at the present time. the movie also mentions various other impactful events, like the mccartney anti-communist program that requires some context to grasp the the impact it has on oppenheimer and the connections the links to communism (elizabeth cox case, for example) and i feel like context around lewis strauss is also important in order to decode some of the messages to fully understand the gravity of the situation. so it seems that the movie is all over the place with some links that require a specific cultural capital to connect all the dots. having that in mind, i can only determine that this movie is build for those who have a wide understanding of the us history, especially regarding the context of the manhattan project and the discourse that followed it.one thing that did bother me quite a lot was the portrait of a scientist and the science community that this movie attempts to push. it's in no ways a negative connotation but it isn't a honest one either as it's the most evident signifier of commercialization - to say it mildly, every one that represented science in some way was presented as a witty fellow that spends most of his time talking, discussing theoretical phenomena and coming to the conclusions on the dot. at a certain point doing the movie, there was a critical remark suggesting that oppenheimer stopped being a physicist a while ago and he's more of a politician now. to some extent, i'd have to agree because most of the scientist were portrayed more like politicians. apart from the basic quantum mechanics principles and paradoxes that we're mentioned early in the movie, most of the scientific discourse didn't have a clear message to connotate it's magnitude.on the flipside, i loved the idea how the creation of the atomic bomb in way did start off the chain event that will lead to the destruction of the world. the whole discourse regarding the moral and the philosophical consequences of the atomic bomb after the successful test was just magnificent and in a way that's when the real movie has started for me. the scenes with exquisite sound design and hallucination-like visuals of how the people in the room from oppenheimer's perspective might look under the atomic blast were breathtaking. the ideas of having blood on your hand just for taking part in creating a weapon of mass-destruction are mind-boggling. and the visuals, the visuals at certain scenes do deserve all the praise. although the story took too many ""off-road"" turns, at least in my opinion, i still want to commend the story to be rather comprehensible, even though it wasn't linear at all and had multiple jumps in time. after just one watch i can't tell whether the switch from color to black & white scenes helped to grasp the time jumps or not, perhaps it's just the room or surrounding or the context itself that helped connect the timeline in order, but the presentation in such of the story in such a way did help me to understand the story just a little bit better, leaving only the questions in context behind.overall, i can't say this is a bad movie in any way possible but i can't say that i particularly liked it either. the hype for the movie was real - whether it was reddit post showcasing the massive film reel of this movie or early film reviewers portraying this movie as an important landmark in cinema - but i feel the hype also ruined the movie for me a bit as i definitely didn't meet the expectations it set off for me. at the end of the day, i'm just happy most movie snobs and just casual movie viewers can enjoy and appreciate this as a cinema marvel. even though i don't fall into that category, i must admit that the general discourse surrounding this movie does make me happy and the fact that it made a lot of people look into such an influential figure in modern history is great too.",6
"945","oppenheimer"," bloated, talky, unnecessarily complicated.","heykateforever",2024-02-17,"i have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. i studied oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. very interesting to study him. i'm not sure what i expected of this movie, but cillian murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. while i understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if i had not already understood the history, i'm not sure i would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.too me? it seemed bloated with too many big hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. christopher nolan's self-centered bow to how many hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. it was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of nolan's success in hollywood. and too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in japan. the fact that the enola gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? a three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?i am definitely not an elitist. i don't ""get"" modern art, i never get invited to posh parties. i am an average american who still knows more about doctor oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. it was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. but hollywood is hollywood. and they miss the mark 90% of the time. i expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. this should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!! period!!",2

"950","oppenheimer"," here he is, who has become death, the destroyer of worlds...","alekspredator87",2023-12-18,"perhaps ""oppenheimer"" really became the main film of 2023. several factors came together, among which the undoubtedly interesting personality of the father of the nuclear bomb, the manhattan project, a scattering of famous actors both in the main roles and in the roles of the second and sometimes even the third plan. and of course, the big name of the director of the picture. christopher nolan has won the hearts of many viewers and film fans over his more than thirty-year career as a director. his track record includes gorgeous and controversial tapes. but one thing cannot be taken away: the biopic about robert oppenheimer is a clear challenge to himself.nolan's project aroused interest only when it was announced that the next work would be a painting about the biography of one of the most famous people of the 20th century. i remember thinking at the time that somehow this project did not fit in with the work of nolan, a wonderful visionary, blockbuster strategist. now that oppenheimer has been viewed, i understand that the director has decided to take a new step in his career. chris decided to try himself in a different genre. and, in my opinion, he did it well.the picture covers several decades of the scientist's life, shows the busy life of a man, his relationship with his wife, mistress, and many other people, among whom the line of interaction with the head of the us atomic energy commission, lewis strauss, is especially important.the picture differs sharply from the usual nolan narrative. there is no need to wait for the huge scale and splendor of aimax filming, which the author loves so much. the film excites in a completely different way. there are a lot of characters, a non-linear narrative and two story arcs, which, as i see it, are specially created in color and in a black-and-white picture. one of them, in color, shows the subjective point of view of the main character, robert oppenheimer. this arch allows you to trace the story of robert's life as the father of the atomic bomb sees it. the second one is made in black and white (or rather the absence of such) and is designed to show an objective picture and at the same time focuses on the story of lewis strauss. nolan adds a bright tempo, a very large number of dialogues, fast editing and excellent music by ludwig goransson.nolan's characters are lively and multifaceted. you will not be able to see outright villains and enemies here. there are just people here who have become part of history. they accomplish it by changing the fate of mankind once and for all, creating the sword of damocles, which to this day hangs over the whole world with an invisible tip. what was created many decades ago, that terrible weapon that is now taken for granted, may well have been created as a deterrent. but it may just as well be fatal, once it hits entire nations.all these problems run like a red thread through the narrative of the picture. nolan shows his oppenheimer as a man who sees in nightmares what he himself created. and the main merit of the script, the direction and, of course, the actor cillian murphy, who plays robert, is that nerve, that taut string that oppenheimer has turned into over the years. the film shows how this man suffers from what he has given to people. and if from episode to episode we see that he reacts vaguely to his offspring, which will bring death, then closer to the finale the protagonist changes, as if not giving a sign to others, but having wild pain and nightmares inside himself, imagining how he became the destroyer of worlds.the cast is great. there are a lot of famous names in diverse roles. robert downey jr. stands apart from murphy, of course. the script disposes in such a way that the latter acts as a kind of antagonist, a person, which is very important for this story. maybe so. i didn't see any amazing performance by downey jr., he might be even better, but the actor coped with this role perfectly.the painting is undoubtedly an important milestone in the career of killian murphy. he starred with christopher many times, but he took the main role for the first time and, in my opinion, coped with it just great.""oppenheimer"" can hardly be written into the best works of christopher nolan. the author has much stronger films, among which there is no doubt ""interstellar"", ""inception"", the trilogy about the dark knight, ""the prestige"" and others. but this film is a message to the world that we all live in a dangerous time when it is worth rethinking the world order, where there are global challenges. the film is ready to give a strong slap in the face so that people wake up and think where they are taking us, what we will come to in the end. in addition, the picture shows how the author's name can work for him. and nolan's original movie turned out to be so interesting that it attracted a mass consumer. the film will not give ratings to everything that was shown. this is a great move by nolan. the viewer himself must speculate after the credits, who is who in this story, and, most importantly, what those events led us to.the painting demonstrates and declares that the creation of atomic weapons was conceived as something that would put an end to wars once and for all. maybe so, maybe not. we will never know the true motives of the people who turned atomic energy into a dangerous weapon. however, even if we assume that this was the case, our modernity clearly shows that achieving world peace does not work. and it may never work.8 out of 10.",8
"951","oppenheimer"," film of the decade","hcoe-95812",2023-07-19,"christopher nolan, once again, uses astonishing film techniques to embark the audience on an other worldly adventure. he brings to light the historical significance of the manhattan project and los alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as cillian murphy and matt damon. by using los alamos and new mexico as a film location for the film, nolan is able to portray what life would have been for oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the trinity test.as someone who grew up in los alamos, i could arguably say that oppenheimer correctly highlights the history of the town and the creation of the atomic bomb alongside nolan's own creative input to emphasise oppenheimer's story.cillian murphy delivers such a vast and emotionally compelling role by highlighting the moral dilemma oppenheimer himself faced and on that we deal with in todays age.for being a 3 hr plus film the pacing is incredible and an average movie goer can endure such horror, mystery, and drama all in one storyline that fills holes at the end created in the beginning.",10

""show, don't tell"".they do a lot of talking in this film about the decisions, actions and the results of what goes on in the film - but what makes the audience relate to what's going on unless you actually show the danger and the horror? is this film made to make you think? then they need to deliver properly. people get a hint of the danger of the bomb but merely do clever politics around it. i'm quite disappointed in such a slow burn of a movie. what's more interesting? seeing the results of the characters or just hearing about them in fast cuts? you decide. i love long discussions too and mindplay.actors are great.. cinematography is great. score is great and the story is fantastic. the execution is just lazy and low budget.",6
"954","oppenheimer"," complexity","davidmvining",2023-12-23,"there's something about how christopher nolan approaches making films that makes them seem incredibly ambitious. a biopic (honestly, my least favorite genre) that jumps back and forth in time between as many as four different timelines that includes the trinity test and is mostly just people talking in a couple of rooms ends up feeling thoroughly cinematic. his approach to making films is heavily reliant on editing to feed his time-jumping sensibilities, all while he provides a very tactile physical reality for everything that plays out. it's also interesting because these things tend to try and distill complex characters into essentially soundbites, but nolan completely embraces the contradictions of the man at the center of it, providing few easy answers (those tend to be my niggling issues with the film).the film moves back and forth mainly using two events as the springboards, the first is the hearing for the renewal of j. robert oppenheimer's (cillian murphy) q clearance in 1954 and the second being the committee hearing in the senate for the approval of lewis strauss (robert downey jr.) to eisenhower's cabinet in 1959. the conflict between the two men is multifaceted and, despite some characters insisting that it's purely from personal pique on the part of strauss, involves a lot of moving pieces that nolan is completely unafraid of digging into the details. they range from strauss's insistence that oppenheimer turned albert einstein (tom conti) against him to oppenheimer openly humiliating strauss at a committee hearing regarding radioisotopes to oppenheimer's automatic insistence at all times to try and influence policy leading to the sharing of nuclear secrets with the soviet union during the cold war.that last one is the nucleus of most of the interpersonal interactions we watch in the flashbacks over oppenheimer's life from his college days through his early university postings to his recruitment to lead the manhattan project by general groves (matt damon). at all times, oppenheimer is flirting with communism, like trying to help the lab workers unionize at berkeley, much to the chagrin of his coworker ernest lawrence (josh hartnett) or attending communist gatherings with his brother frank (dylan arnold) where he meets jean tatlock (florence pugh) with whom he has an affair. he's constantly surrounded himself with communists, toyed with the ideology, never officially joined the party, and is happy to trust any physicist as a scientist first and foremost, even klaus fuchs (christopher denham) who ended up being an actual soviet spy on the project.it's kind of funny that the dramatic core of the film is the secret that strass, embittered personally and frustrated with oppenheimer for other reasons as well, secretly handpicked roger robb (jason clarke) to lead the inquiry into oppenheimer's q clearance, essentially turning it into a trial without evidentiary procedures. he also leaked the american energy commission's file to william borden (david dastmalchian) who wrote up new conclusions based on existing confidential evidence, sent it to j. edgar hoover, and ignited the whole need for a hearing on his q clearance in the first place. it's all so inside baseball and behind closed doors, and the manic pace that nolan sets the entire film along with his penchant for time jumping through editing makes it all really compelling.i've seen a bunch of criticism that says that the film flags after the trinity test, and i have to disagree. i found the presentation of the culminations of the two hearings to be riveting. i also really appreciated that the film really does embrace this portrait of oppenheimer as a complex man, that maybe some of the criticism against him was perhaps valid, especially his blindness to the politics of his fellow travelers on the left and their loyalties to an alternate mode of governance than american republicanism.also, the middle hour or so dedicated to the trinity test, the building of the bomb, the testing of different aspects, all while the focus never really flags from the potential conflicts at the heart of oppenheimer's vision of the world, is great. it's this steady build, helped in no small part by the nearly operatic score from ludwig goransson, towards a specific goal, given great flavor by building up the near zero possibility that the detonation of an atomic bomb could ignite the atmosphere and destroy the whole world. nolan is a showman, and he plays that up great. it's tense, intricately assembled, and really well executed.this is a huge film with the canvas being a single man. i think it approaches the portrait of him without resorting to easy answers (though strauss ends up too easy a villain, i think, my only major complaint of the film) while dramatizing events that presented more traditionally might not have been nearly as compelling. acting is very good all around with the two leads (murphy and downey jr.) dedicating everything to portraying their characters. the supporting cast all the way down is equally good as well.i love nolan's ambition. he's got this expansive view of how much he can tell in the cinematic form, propulsively moving the story forward at all times, making 3 hours feel like 2, all while embracing complexity in multiple forms. i don't think this is his best film or the top tier of them all, but it's probably the most ambitious and ambiguous. that's something to admire.",8

"961","oppenheimer"," oppenheimer might seem like a departure for a director best known for epic science fiction and a trilogy of comic book movies, but it's possibly his masterpiece","dr_clarke_2",2023-12-05,"after the time-bending visual spectacle of tenet, director christopher nolan clearly fancied something different for his next movie, oppenheimer. starring cillian murphy as the eponymous j. robert oppenheimer, it is a biographical thriller charting oppenheimer's life and career up to and after the invention of the atomic bomb, and it succeeds in being as engrossing as anything nolan has made in the past.oppenheimer focuses on the man rather than the bomb that he became famous (or infamous) for, although the two are inextricably linked. the film opens with oppenheimer attending the hearing that revoked his security clearance and then unfolds in flashback; the hearing frames the film, with the narrative frequently flicking backwards and forwards in time as testimony is offered. nolan wrote the screenplay, based on american prometheus by kai bird and martin j. sherwin, and the narrative conceit of the hearing is subtly used to intrigue, as it assembles a picture of oppenheimer's life and personality; the audience knows that oppenheimer ends up in the hearing, but how and why unfolds more gradually.the actual bomb test forms a very small part of a very long film. the rest is character and dialogue based and yet remains utterly gripping, partly due to the characterisation, partly due to murphy completely immersing himself in the title role, and partly because the political manoeuvring, military logistics and - impressively - physics are thoroughly absorbing. nevertheless, the film starts to feel like a thriller once the race to build a bomb before either the nazis or the russians gathers pace, and the eventual build up to the first bomb test is edge-of-seat tense. when it finally comes, the incidental music builds to a crescendo, only for the explosion takes place in silence, slowed down and with the camera lingering on the rising column of flames; it's a brief moment of visual spectacle as impressive as one might expect from the director of inception and interstellar.the real-life characters are convincingly written and brought to life by an a-list cast that includes - amongst many other noteworthy names - robert downey jr. as strauss, emily blunt as kitty, florence pugh as jean tatlock, and matt damon as general groves. downey jr gives an impeccable, quiet performance as strauss, the man who ultimately ruins oppenheimer's subsequent career out of spite and who only loses his cool when his own political aspirations are thwarted. damon is excellent as he surprisingly likeable groves, whilst josh hartnett - cast against type - convinces as physicist ernest lawrence. jason clarke gives a significant and compelling performance as the formidable roger robb, whilst casey affleck is quietly intimidating performance as the ruthless boris pash. in a film dominated by men, blunt and pugh both give electrifying performances, with kitty's withering confrontation with robb at the hearing proving a fleeting highlight. nolan casts many of his regular collaborators in various roles, with a barely recognisable gary oldman as harry s. truman and kenneth branagh playing nils bohr.if oppenheimer is more character-based and less visually spectacular than many of nolan's previous films, it is no less cinematically impressive for it. the film mixes elaborate sets, location filming, and recreations of explosions to great effect, whilst special effects are used powerfully to show how haunted oppenheimer is after the bomb is dropped on hiroshima. the makeup used to age the characters is impeccable. hoyte van hoytema provides the cinematography, having collaborated with nolan on three previous films, and uses the camera to carefully frame the actors, frequently in static or lingering close-ups. parts of the film are shot in black and white (on film developed specially for the movie), a stylistic decision that serves no purpose other than to grab the audience's attention, which it does. ludwig g√∂ransson provides the highly effective, omnipresent score, having previously done so for tenet.oppenheimer might seem like a departure for a director best known for epic science fiction and a trilogy of comic book movies, but it explores many of the themes familiar from his increasingly extensive body of work. it is cinema at its best and, just possibly, nolan's masterpiece.",10

"967","oppenheimer"," a cold, long history lesson","apereztenessa-1",2023-07-23,"oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. first, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. and second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. having watched the film, i can confidently say none of those promises are true.for a christopher nolan film, oppenheimer is very unspectacular, with only a handful of atomic explosion images, which -unfortunately- are not new and will not impact anyone in the audience. and it's also quite unemotional. you leave the theatre feeling like you just went through a (rather long) history lesson, but not particularly devastated. because the film chooses -as is often the case with nolan- a clinical approach to its subject, and the contradictions and dilemmas of oppenheimer are observed the way one observes an insect, instead of a human character. it looks as if nolan were trying to compete in intelligence with the scientists in his film. this is nolan's consistent flaw. he is so insecure that he is only happy when he has proven to everyone how intelligent he is. to do this, in addition to the ice cold way in which he treats his characters, he throws into oppenheimer his signature mixing of time periods, always afraid people will see him as mediocre if he ever just followed the chronological order of events. and in this case, he adds black and white to one of the time periods of the movie, which makes the whole thing a little cheesy.but as always too, nolan shows control of the medium, and delivers some strong moments with virtuoso camera movements, broad shots and a great score. most enjoyable in the film is the performance of its extraordinary cast. every last one of them is outstanding, starting with cillian murphy as oppenheimer.the balance is a bit of an average film, undeniably very long and a bit boring, despite the talent of the filmmaker and the cast.",5

"1019","oppenheimer"," theory only gets you so far...","joberthefboom",2023-12-04,"with the recent releases of 'oppenheimer' and 'barbie', a new cultural phenomenon seems to have taken place that will help define the mainstream cinema of this decade. it is interesting to note how both films enhanced the other to solidify themselves as modern classics, if not for their craftmanship alone, then because of the hype that surrounded them. christopher nolan's latest, especially, is a testament to his greatness as a filmmaker. his previous movies, while always entertaining, have a tendency of pretentiousness, of wanting to be something they aren't really. 'oppenheimer' works so well because the story is grounded in history, and nolan uses this snapshot of time to get to the bigger ideas he always intended to show, making this the best film yet, of his already illustrious career.as usual for nolan, time plays an important role in 'oppenheimer'. the film itself can be reduced to three parts, each lasting an hour, in which the character is introduced to the audience, in which we see him build the invention he became known for, and how he needs to come to terms with the consequences of his creation. all this is being told through nolan's signature style of structural experimentation. the life of oppenheimer, and his accomplishments, is being contrasted with the senate hearing of the film's secondary antagonist, lewis strauss, and the interrogation of oppenheimer's loyalty to the united states of america. despite being incredibly dense and full of information, the three-hour running time goes by surprisingly quickly. this can be attributed to the way in which nolan manages the time, never telling us more than we should know at that particular moment in the film, and thus keeping the suspense throughout.another key mention in achieving this accomplishment is reserved for editor jennifer lame. because there is so much of the story to tell, and much of the film is men talking in rooms, it is quite the task to make all of it engaging for the audience. she manages to do just that, with very quick and hard cuts, giving the feel of an action movie, which is needed for the film to succeed. especially in the first hour, where the speed of the shots and the rhythm behind them, help visualize oppenheimer's immense gifts. how he saw visions of the underlying reality that physics tries to expose. how he learned to look at the world differently, communicated to us through the art of pablo picasso.despite it being a biopic, the film doesn't think too highly of its protagonist, even though it states his world-altering importance. the character oppenheimer is used as a portal for showing how ambition and arrogance can corrupt even the greatest of minds. oppenheimer would have been a weak man, were it not for his incredible intellect. a man capable of moral thought, but not guided by it. only through reflection on his decisions does he arrive at any form of morality, but always does so too late. unable to commit to anything truthfully, driven only by his ego and his impulses. lusting after women he cannot have and failing to take a firm stance on his politics, in spite of his clear sympathies for communist ideologies. someone of obvious substance, but no conviction, making him both particle and wave. when our main character is introduced to niels bohr in the beginning of the film, bohr asks what the j in j. robert oppenheimer stands for, ""nothing, apparently'' his tutor quips. a cheeky way of translating the spine-lessness of the man we would follow around for three full hours. this is the story of someone incapable to decide on his direction, and unable to face the consequences of his actions, despite his evident genius. theory, really does, only get you so far.but then again, what would happen if you stole fire from the gods and gifted them to mankind? if you became prometheus, but also opened pandora's box? if you were adam and eve and the snake that made them sin in the garden of eden? would such a burden not be too heavy to bear for us mere mortals? would your act, and the effects that follow it, not appear larger than anything you could ever be? his creation of divine power would end up breaking him, but his arrogance and curiosity would not allow him otherwise. a victim of his own potential, with the only chance of redemption being martyrdom. a mythmaking that is eventually granted to him by lewis strauss, someone who shares a lot of similarities with oppenheimer himself, and someone who would commit the same mistakes he did. two entitled men, desperate to write history for themselves, only to get humbled by the very thing they helped create, all because they could not keep their pride and ambitions under control.",9

"1034","oppenheimer"," absorbing, extremely well-acted, and a fascinating subject","don2507",2023-07-30,"it's gratifying to know that in a supposedly ""dumbed down"" america, a three-hour docudrama about a theoretical physicist and his atomic ""project,"" along with a closed-door security clearance hearing and an open senate confirmation hearing, both full of dialogue and minimal ""action,"" is generating a huge, but deservedly so, box office. i found this film mesmerizing as the three hours seem to fly by for me. it has a very intelligent script, some masterful acting, and a focus on a fascinating, if enigmatic, character, i.e., oppenheimer. the ""father"" of the atomic bomb was, indeed, a genius and generous-minded (on occasion), but also exhibited character flaws, and for such an adept administrator was also politically na√Øve.the physicists behind the letter to fdr knew germany had a head start in nuclear power (germany under otto hahn was the first nation to split the atom), and it would have been a dangerous world indeed if hitler had a monopoly on the atomic bomb, but those same physicists were reluctant to use it against japan in the waning days of the pacific war, and oppenheimer shared some of their reservations. the subsequent guilt he felt was manifest in a great scene in the film where he meets with truman and says he has blood on his hands. truman barks to him: ""no you don't; you built it but i authorized its use."" later in the film, where he's being humiliated at the security clearance hearing, his psychologically astute wife asks him why is he putting up with this in person....""you must need this humiliation as penance for your guilt.""kudos to nolan for not, at least explicitly, tying the use of the two bombs to japan's surrender. in fact, except for one high level meeting where potential targets are discussed, there's almost zero real-time reference to hiroshima, nagasaki, or the battleship missouri. it's almost folklore in u. s. history, but not elsewhere, that the two bombs were solely crucial in bringing about a surrender from a fanatical enemy, but although most of us americans don't want to believe this, soviet entry into the war against japan (at our behest; see yalta) was probably more crucial. the 5-year soviet-japan neutrality pact offered some hope to japan's war cabinet that a negotiated settlement could moderately soften the blow of unconditional surrender. when the soviet union invaded manchuria that hope was irretrievably gone and the japanese leadership was shocked. there are more references to soviet entry into the war in the minutes of the war cabinet than the the atomic bombs which were indeed appalling to the leadership. the soviets invaded the kuril islands and had plans, if the war continued, of invading japan's large northern island of hokkaido. the war cabinet wanted no parts of a soviet, even if shared, occupation of any of the home islands.another historical issue is prompted by the film, and that is the veiled depiction that the physicists who were jewish seemed more interested (if necessary) in using the bomb against nazi germany (who could blame them as emigres) but very reluctant to use it against japan in the closing days. there's one pre-war scene where oppenheimer meets heisenberg in germany, and as depicted, it's a fairly amiable meeting. heisenberg's ww ii impact is interesting. he apparently led the german nuclear effort which was subsequently found to be not very far along. why, with the head start they had? some explanations: (1) speer did not allocate sufficient financial resources, (2) a negative opinion on heisenberg is that he tried hard but made lots of mistakes, (3) a positive opinion on heisenberg is that he purposely sabotaged the nazi effort, and (4) theoretical physics in nazi germany was referred to as jewish physics.",10
"1035","oppenheimer"," while it is not christopher nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best works in history.","iamianiman",2023-07-20,"christopher nolan, whose previous works use time and space as his playground, did it once again with this based on a true story film, something that we didn't expect. his way of storytelling proves that he's the greatest directors to ever live on the planet, mastering in building up the story all the while keeping the audience engaged by elevating its suspense, scope, atmosphere and music tempos, creating a masterpiece ouevre.oppenheimer is a visceral experience. it is able to create and provoke tension and anxiety in their audience. rarely do we ever get this type of films offering this kind of experience but nolan did it, just like interstellar or inception. it is haunting. it is moving. it is evocative. it knows what it tries to deliver and it does so well in eliciting these emotions as you sit and witness through it all.out of the 2 dozens of famous actors in this film, we have to give special shout outs to 4 of them namely cillian murphy, emily blunt, robert downey jr. & jason clarke. cillian murphy is able to tell oppenheimer's story largely from the looks and expressions of his face, a true work of art. his face just tells everything, like a grandeur painting that moves accordingly to the beat of the story and emotions. emily blunt as mrs oppenheimer is just impeccable. her performance is so good, there was once scene that made us cried a bit. that 'it' scene that will appear on the screen as her name is called as one of the nominees for best supporting actress and hell yes, we have high hope she will win next year's academy awards for this! downey and clarke are both impressive as well, 2 characters that are very good at spoken dialogues and they really did their homework to study the characters very well.we are truly in love with the dialogues. it is rich with contexts and it feels very densed. we just love the fact that the speed and pacing of the dialogues are almost similar to aaron sorkin's materials who directed the social network and molly's game. dialogues are spoken incessantly, word after word, without putting a full stop for audience to breathe. and these dialogues really enrich and enhance the film's build-up, settings and mood that elevate the whole immersive experience.these dialogues, most of them, are necessary for the story and character developments. what are or have been said are the building blocks of both these elements, that by the end, they blossom themselves into something poetically but shatteringly beautiful; acknowledging of the broken humans living in a broken world, that these non-fiction characters are far from perfect, just like the rest of us.however, the dialogues may not be easily digestible for general audiences. if you're into science and history, you are at an advantage. if not, then these jargons and sometimes, poetic style dialogues would make your head spin. they are not friendly. even when they did explain on quantum physics, it wasn't something that can be understood by everyone. we love the dialogues but to be safe, prepare a cup of coffee prior because this is one brain exercise film, the good kind, of course.if you're a nolan fan, you'd know that plot twists are something he has in store for us. but did this biopic has one? did nolan take that risk? the risk that might jeopardize the authenticity of the story? without revealing, we can say that the third act is very, very good. something that most directors attempted but failed. however, nolan did it naturally, the story unfolds excellently even with all the complexity that surrounds it. he did it smooth. strong emotions were evoked, he left us something to ponder about. the experience was quite traumatic and he brought us along the journey to experience what it's like to be oppenheimer. it is that good.this film is morally complex. it questions whether it's right or wrong. it questions whose side we are on. it delves deep and studies mr. oppenheimer and brings it along with us for the ride. nolan was able to let us feel what he's feeling as if we're stepping in his shoes. thought-provoking. mind-wandering. psychologists will have a great time in cinemas.a brilliant choice, oppenheimer used both black-and-white and colour as it conveys different meanings with the former staying true to the real event that had happened in history with (mostly) exact dialogues, body language and circumstances powerfully acted mostly by robert downey and alden ehrenreich. the latter is used, to maximize its entertainment value while still maintains the actual events recorded in history. not once we felt annoyed by the transition, it went well.targeted for mass market, we felt this could have cut about 20-30 minutes short so that all audiences can enjoy. although there was very little to none unnecessary scenes, we still strongly believe that nolan could take out a few scenes. if this happened, the momentum and pacing would better for everyone. also, the trinity test was purely excellent. the practical effects and sound designs were really executed well. the music score, composed by ludwig goransson, though not as masterpiece as hans zimmer, is breathtaking. it felt right with all the scenes, it elevates out immersive experience, it left us at the edge of our seats.verdict: hauntingly beautiful, oppenheimer feels like a ticking time bomb as it evokes a strong visceral and immersive experience. almost everything is done right, christopher nolan makes sure this film blows us away with a rich story, stark character studies, strong dialogues, powerful music score, impeccable acting amongst many others. while it is not christopher nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best ouevre in history.",8

"1045","oppenheimer"," astounding - and not for any special effects","richard-1787",2023-07-23,"this is one of the most intriguing and astounding movies i have had the pleasure of seeing in my over 60 years of movie going. yes, there are some impressive special effects, but they are truly the least impressive things here.first is the script. a great deal of history is condensed into three hours of often quickly delivered dialogue. it is succinct, and it is often brilliantly structured. flashbacks, flashforwards, jump cuts, etc. not to impress, as was too often the case in dunkirk, but to create an ever richer tapestry of historical events and tie them together. definitely deserves an oscar.second is the directing. getting all of this to flow, and often rush forward in an intelligent and cohesive way was an act, or many acts, of directorial genius. nolan was nominated for a best director oscar for dunkirk, but didn't win. this time he should definitely win. his work bringing all this together is phenominal.the acting is all fine to very fine. it should definitely make a star out of cillian murphy, whom i had never heard of before but who does a fine job as oppenheimer. damon is good as groves, though i suspect some of his dialogue was ""enhanced"" to make the character more interesting. i read groves' book on the manhattan project. he didn't come off as that blunt and forceful.the editing is also remarkable. i was especially impressed with some of the sound choices at crucial moments, such as the explosion of the test bomb. it keeps you on your toes and makes you think because it delivers the unexpected.this movie is 3 hours long. i was not bored for a single minute.my hat is off to nolan. this is truly a work of genius.",10
"1046","oppenheimer"," if this isn't a masterpiece, i don't know what else is.","achyut_prashast_singh",2023-08-01,"oppenheimer is a rare biopic which, in spite of being driven entirely by dialogue and character drama, never bored me at any point. i was so amazed by the film that even after many a times not understanding the scientific stuff and all, i was glued to the screen, understanding it through the characters and their actions alone. i loved every bit of it and was totally focused. once it was over, i walked out with a sense of satisfaction.oppenheimer is christopher nolan's masterpiece which he has painted with the help of talented actors such as cillian murphy who has sunken his teeth into the portrayal of the protagonist. he dominates every scene he is in, and i'm hoping he definitely gets an oscar nod next year. if not him, then at least robert downey jr. deserves one for sure. his electrifying performance is so good you won't even think about seeing an old tony stark at all. similarly terrific are emily blunt, matt damon and florence pugh who leave the desired impact.the first half focuses on the character more than the main explosion which is later showcased in one of the most ingenious and cinematically remarkable ways. that means i should also warn you to not come merely for the explosion. this is a heavy dialogue-driven drama with little bit of action and almost no violence. a thriller feel is maintained throughout with the help of the background score, and that makes many scenes more intriguing to watch. i personally felt the human drama of oppenheimer was more appealing than the explosion itself, because that is what this film is actually about: his life before and after the nuclear test. the film also excels in the technical departments; the sound editing is truly remarkable, and will make you hold your breath multiple times.i must say oppenheimer turned out to be even better than what i had imagined. it was nowhere boring to be fair, and that's rare for a movie which is so long and driven entirely by conversations. those who blindly follow the hype and go for fun are bound to be disappointed because this biographical & political courtroom drama has neither the set pieces nor the sci-fi of nolan's previous movies. it is the kind of film which gets better with subsequent viewings. i'm just glad it made me return to the big screen after months and delivered what i paid for. the only sad part is, there's no imax near me, otherwise i'd have gone a second time too.",10
"1047","oppenheimer"," it's the bomb","alexburrow-43430",2023-12-04,"i love the fact how this move deals with the internal struggles of robert oppenheimer. it really shows how knowledge can be used as a weapon of mass destruction. i also like the twist at the end when robert downey, jr.'s character betrayed oppenheimer. the visuals in this movie are stunning. i think this movie has a good tone and pace. the slow talking parts are balanced out with drama and i like that that it's not just boring but you also feel like somethings is getting done every single time someone's talking in it and it really moves the plot forward. the one negative about this movie would be that i feel like it drags on a bit towards it. i recommend this movie to people who love history.",9
"1048","oppenheimer"," mixed bag, and yes, i was bored","fixedyourending",2023-07-24,"was looking forward to seeing this movie on the big screen. big fan of nolan's previous movies and i usually like political and historical drama. on one side giving this movie anything less than '7' is hard, due to spectacular technical creation and a wonderful story told, but also i would argue that this movie does not deliver enough for its 3 hours length, in terms of interest and emotional attachment for the audience.i think most people will agree on what makes this movie a great hollywood production, intense story and great level of realism, however here is a list of things that i didn't like:1. unlike popular opinion, i did not like the casting. the actor list is full with big names, but many of them could have been better casted, in particular i did not like the cast of matt damon (as leslie groves, the army general) and tom conti as albert einstein. even more unpopular, i think r. downey jr. is also a bad cast and i kept seeing iron man instead of the character he was playing.2. it's quite boring. by at large the movie is pretty uneventful, there are pretty much 3 events - 1 is a surreal sex scene, 2 is the blow-up experiment, and 3 is the aftermath ""trial"". by the 3rd hour i saw people starting to check their phones in the theater. i usually get very upset of people that check the phone during the movie, but in this case i could totally relate with them.3. failure to create emotion. i'm not sure what it is, but something really kept me from identifying with any of the characters. it is almost like the actors were too good for the role they are given in the movie, so a little tie-in with my complaint on the casting, or it could be the strong left-wing vibes in the movie, but the bottom-line is that you are not really feeling the pain of any of the characters.so, it's a '7', probably will win an oscar or two. it is an important historical story but it felt too much like a history lesson then an entertainment piece, so overall disappointing for me as a big-screen experience and a nolan fan.",7
"1049","oppenheimer"," excellent","faiknadir",2023-12-04,"most people thinks oppenheimer closed himself a house and invented the atomic bomb. this is a common mistake. oppenheimer was a peaceful man that coordinator of invention of the most destructive weapon in the world, oliver stone said.first, nolan told us this story perfectly. so i can say the movie is one of the best biographic movies of all time. second, every historical people that effected this process found a place themselves in this movie. this is also okay.details are perfect, music is good, actors and actresses are magnificent. everything is perfect about oppenheimer. i'm goong to say 3 oscars at least.",10
"1050","oppenheimer"," just not good.","hypnoticpoison7",2023-07-26,"i'm a huge nolan fan since his first film. my favorite is still memento, which is thorough and slow and very dialogue heavy as well as philosophical. i have a friend who works in los alamos as a chemical engineer and have visited the area as well as heard plenty about oppenheimer and the way he changed the world. the importance of scientists and especially theoretical physicists is not lost on me. between all that and my love for cillian murphy and emily blunt, i'd been looking forward to this movie for a long time.that said, my entire group was disappointed with this movie, starting with the run time. i ask you, how is it possible that a three hour movie can feel rushed?! somehow nolan managed it. the first hour of the film feels so fast, disjointed and erratic that it gives you anxiety. he breezes over the most important parts of oppenheimer's life and elaborates more on scenes that never happened (such as the ones with einstein). the movie should be about a great man with conflicting emotions and instead we get political tripe with entirely fictional material. the real oppenheimer had such an interesting life and personality that there was no need to embellish or insert so much random nudity, politics and matt damon. i'm still wondering what nolan's point was in making this film. why not just make a documentary if you're going to make such a boring lackluster story? there's just nothing here to pull you in and we really paid close attention. eric weinstein should have been consulted so we could have had a better movie discussing the plight of actual scientists in this country and how they are treated by our government. tell the story of how secrets are kept from the scientific community to protect governments rather than citizens in order to slow progress and divert attention elsewhere. whatever nolan's point was, it was lost somewhere in the three hours of cameos and more anti russian propaganda.",4
"1051","oppenheimer"," nolan's most personal and best screenplay.","sydmiller12",2023-12-08,"like the headline says this film had a lot of heart and it treats each character with care and nolan writes them very well. i haven't been able to connect this much to a nolan character since interstellar.another thing i have to praise is the cinematography from hoyte van hoytema is amazing as per usual he always delivers and this is no different.nolan's direction is very thought out in terms of blocking and where he decides to place the character. and i think his direction goes very hand in hand with the writing. also, another thing that goes hand in hand with the writing is the editing from jennifer lame who is an amazing editor, and i think this is some of her best work.every performance is amazing. and every actor delivers something interesting to each character. some stand out performances are obviously cillian murphy & florence pugh. i never was really interested a cillian fan but this definitely changed my mind, and i knew florence was an amazing actress since i saw midsommar, i would definitely check her out in a good person which was amazing as well.overall great film!",10
"1052","oppenheimer"," overrated but solid","smilingdiplomatist",2024-02-16,"with nolan directing and a cast of heavy weights like cillian murphy, florence pugh, robert downey jr et al - this film was always going to be great.as a novice in the history of oppenheimer and his contributions to the nuclear bomb, i enjoyed how steeped in real-life (if dramatised) history throughout the film.while a lot of the events of oppenehimer and supporting characters' lives have to be rushed in order to keep the story moving, i felt like the major story beats are covered throughout the first 2/3rds.incredibly compelling themes and disguised and there's some great interplay between the characters with the dialogue.for me, oppenheimer begins to fall flat in the final act, where a lot of the focus is on the trial and blink-and-you-miss-it moments from the previous 2 hours are suddenly pivotal to the plot. i felt like i started losing track of what was going on around this point. while i followed it enough to feel satisfied by the conclusion, it definitely came across feeling like the pacing lost its way during the mid-section of the film.overall though, a great presentation of a significant historical period and played to perfection by the cast.",8
"1053","oppenheimer"," you've never seen a film like oppenheimer","eddie_baggins",2023-07-24,"it's taken me a few days to be able to sit down and write down my thoughts about christoper nolan's newest big screen epic, the other part of the now infamous ""barbenheimer"" double bill that has been re-writing record books over there launch weekends, having had this time to ponder and contemplate i am confident in saying that i've never seen a film quite like this biopic and while it's a film with flaws and components that don't stick their respective landings, nolan's film is nevertheless a powerful, poignant and technically marvellous piece of original film-making that further establishes the esteemed director as a generational talent whose skill set is unrivalled.it's incredible to think that a three hour dialogue heavy expose of a theoretical physicist and the creation of the worlds first atomic bomb could become a film that is being viewed on such a scale that oppenheimer is currently playing too and while it's clearly been enhanced by the fact nolan's heavy hitting drama has been partnered alongside the pink behemoth that's barbie, there's also no denying that audiences are hungry for original content that gives them something more than just another run of the mill experience and that's exactly what oppenheimer does.told in a typical nolan like fashion that refuses to play out in a manner that could said to be stereotypical, oppenheimer operates in multiple timelines and requires audiences to pay close attention to who is who but despite covering immense ground and delving into far more than just oppenheimer's past, present and future or the bomb he was responsible for bringing into existence, nolan's film never becomes too complicated or overbearing as clever direction, editing and script work ensures that its three hour runtime will grip anyone willing to go along with it, creating an utterly engaging and even white knuckle experience that is the very definition of what cinema is all about.lead by a long overdue and awards worthy turn from cillian murphy as the titular figure, who is ably supported by a string of a-listers that most notably includes key performances from the likes of emily blunt as oppenheimer's long-suffering wife kitty, matt damon as military head honcho leslie groves and robert downey jr. in a scene stealing performance as lewis strauss, oppenheimer is all class on screen as nolan juggles one of the most stacked ensemble casts of the modern era and while some of his big name performers might only get mere minutes of screentime, each and every one of them brings their a-game to what must surely be regarded as nolan's most noteworthy feature yet based on performances.outside of this aspect of nolan's masterwork is the technical elements of this big budget affair that includes an unforgettable score by ludwig g√∂ransson, exemplary editing by jennifer lame, beautiful cinematography from the increasingly impressive hoyte van hoytema and sound mixing/editing from nolan's team that ensures despite the fact oppenheimer is very much focused in on the people at the heart of the story, so much of the film still feels like a grand cinematic offering and there are moments within nolan's opus that are likely to remain some of the most memorable cinematic moments of recent times, none more so than the breathtaking detonation test scene that left my particular screening as silent as a field mouse.i have no doubt that like many of nolan's films in the past decade detractors and naysayers will turn their attention to singling out elements of nolan's film that may be considered weak points and while there's going to be further debate about the sound mix of this film and nolan's films as a whole, that at times have their dialogue drowned out by the score or other aspects of the mix or the debate that rages about nolan's ability to connect on the human level, that is on show here with a strangely cold romantic element between murphy and blunt and also with florence pugh's jean tatlock (not due to performances, more so development) but allowing your gaze to be directed into these areas as a main point of focus is robbing one of the experience they could otherwise have.building to a crescendo that is both surprising, haunting and unforgettable, it's unlikely that you will soon forget oppenheimer, a beautifully staged biopic that is also so many other things all at once, where oppenheimer ranks amongst all of nolan's work will take some time to decide but what's undeniable is the fact nolan has once more proved original film-making is alive and well, should one take the time and care to bring it too life.final say -a film that feels unlike any before it, oppenheimer is a big screen epic that is both grand and intimate, thrilling and confronting and a further addition to the growing legacy of christoper nolan to be regarded as one of the most important voices in cinematic history.5 bowls of marbles out of 5.jordan and eddie (the movie guys)",10

overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with cillian murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future).brilliant direction (the most mature storytelling nolan has ever displayed as he weaves and controls all the scenes on both a macro and micro-scale to drive the story forward to show his message; this was the nolan has ever done in getting the most out of his actors as the acting down the cast is amazing to where there are so many actors that have their best performance with this movie; has a more palatable interpretation of his signature nolan style as he makes the audience think but in a way that they can understand (even if another viewing is needed to provide more clarity)), incredible acting (incredible to brilliant from cillian murphy (a career-defining performance as he truly embodies the role of oppenheimer and is the real lightning rod for other actors to work off of as his presence really drives the performance of others and moves the story forward), great to incredible from emily blunt (plays her role very well as she portrays the trauma and troubled relationship she has with her husband very well, showing the weight of him being passed onto her as the movie goes on), great from matt damon (plays his role very well and works off of cillian to help drive the development of the manhattan project forward, really acts as the moral bridge between the government and the scientists), great to incredible from robert downey jr. (plays a very multi-dimensional role very well as his polished performance shows the cunning nature politicians can have as they try to be two-faced), great from florence pugh (does a great job with the short time she is given as her chemistry with murphy shows the effort jean's relationship had on oppenheimer), great from josh hartnett (my favorite performance out of the secondary cast as his charm really brings personality into the movie that is filled with monotonous scientists), very good from casey affleck (given very little screentime but does a very good job in building tension between murphy in his scenes), very good from rami malek (a key performance in the movie as he does so much with very little given as he really comes to play in the final moments of the movie), very good from kenneth branagh (uses a lot of his experience to play this role as he does well in playing the dane that has an impact on oppenheimer's career), good from benny safdie (kinda the most inexperienced performance of the whole movie but he does a good job in holding his own and building a conflicting relationship with oppenheimer), very good from jason clarke (plays one of the true antagonists of the movie very well as he is a driving presence in the security hearings), good to very good from david krumholtz (the comedic presence of the movie as he does try to make jokes throughout the movie (the only issue is that the movie is moving so fast there is no time to let the jokes stay and marinate with the audience)), very good to great from tom conti (embodies albert einstein very well and it feels like he was perfectly cast as his chemistry with murphy and his delivery helps show the relationship oppenheimer had with einstein), very good from alden ehrenreich (a surprisingly very good performance from a nolan composite character as his performance is the real moral lense the audience has to look into the whole situation), very good from the rest of the cast (this is an understatement with how good the cast was there is no one bad performance in the entire cast, which is incredible given how deep it is)), incredible story (an incredibly dense story that crams many moments in oppenheimer's life into the film, but uses pace and runtime to make it seem like it may be too short at points as all the story points connect and drive the narrative forward; it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the manhattan project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; the non-linear storytelling was an homage to nolan's first break memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the manhattan project), brilliant screenplay (one of the best screenplays i have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best i have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing i have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity), incredible score (incredibly complements the movie well and is used very well to build emotion and create pace and tension throughout), incredible to brilliant cinematography (the mix of imax cameras with large format 70 mm cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie), great sound (the sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear), incredible editing (the cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work i have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen), incredible to brilliant visual effects (some of the best effects work i have ever seen as the use of practical effects over cgi show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology), great production design (this is specifically for los alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town), very good costumes (the costume work for oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come), plot structure was very unique and non-linear as nolan takes a page out of memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and i am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and american community), pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie), climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture), tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone, saw in imax 70 mm and it really is an experience in itself.",10

"1063","oppenheimer"," it's the world in which we now live","lee_eisenberg",2023-07-24,"obviously a lot of the talk about christopher nolan's ""oppenheimer"" has involved its release the same day as greta gerwig's ""barbie"". now that i've seen the former, all that i can say is that you must immediately drop everything and go see this movie, for it reminds you of the world in which we now live.topping the cast is cillian murphy as j. robert oppenheimer. born of humble beginnings, oppenheimer became a renowned physicist and contributed to the development of nuclear weapons. however, his anti-nuclear activism - combined with his association with leftists in the '30s - drew the government's wrath in the post-war years. murphy adopts a less-than-handsome look for the role, and looks increasingly disheveled as the movie progresses, showing oppenheimer's feelings as the government went after him.equally impressive is emily blunt as oppenheimer's wife kitty. if you only know blunt from her audience-pleasing roles (into the woods, mary poppins returns, jungle cruise), then this will be a pleasant surprise. kitty was not what we'd call an ""ideal"" wife. indeed, she often came across as a lousy mother. maybe part of this was because robert spent so much time on her work, but she was not the world's most likable person. it was impressive to see blunt play an abrasive character for a change.but most important is what the movie shows overall. a man who had no malice in his heart helped create the most destructive weapon in history. that, plus the mind-blowing scenes of the nuclear tests, make this almost a horror movie (personal horror, that is).all in all, you should see it if you get a chance. if nothing else, it should remind us of the danger of nuclear weapons. as i read somewhere, as long as they exist, there's the risk that they'll get used.the rest of the cast includes matt damon, robert downey jr., florence pugh, josh hartnett, casey affleck, rami malek and kenneth branagh.",9

"1066","oppenheimer"," nolan's best film to date.","moscarbradley",2023-07-22,"like martin scorsese and alfred hitchcock before him christopher nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. a film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. but what will his followers think of ""oppenheimer""? will today's movie-going generation even know who j. robert oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening i attended i saw two people leave), and can nolan do justice to his subject?to that last question the answer is undoubtedly yes. as i say nolan is a film-maker of great skill and ""oppenheimer"" is unquestionably his best film to date. it's an old-school epic, three hours long, superbly shot on the biggest of canvases and with an all-star cast even if some of those oscar-winning actors are reduced to cameos, (gary oldman as a devious harry truman). at its centre there's a terrific performance from irish actor cillian murphy as oppenheimer, chosen perhaps for his slight resemblance to the man but also because nolan clearly saw in murphy talents other of his screen roles never fully explored.of course, in typical nolan fashion the narrative isn't linear. the film may begin with oppenheimer the cambridge student and end with oppenheimer the decorated old man but in-between nolan skips back and forth in time, shooting both in colour and in black and white and framing his film around two sets of 'hearings', one in which oppenheimer, late in his career, appears before a committee of three to see if his security clearance will be renewed, knowing that this is nothing more than a kangaroo court; the other, filmed in black and white, the much larger senate committee hearings set up to determine the suitability of lewis strauss to be u. s. secretary of commerce in eisenhower's government and in this role robert downey jr. not only give the best performance of his career but should be a shoo-in for the best supporting actor oscar. these scenes form the backbone of the film and may prove too talkative for nolan's customary audience. that said, this is a beautifully composed and highly intelligent picture, clearly aimed at an adult audience. i wouldn't be at all surprised if it sweeps the boards at next year's oscars.",10

"1068","oppenheimer"," nolan did it again","anibalcnso",2023-08-06,"this film is a damn masterpiece. there are not enough words to propperly describe it and, at the same time, few sentences can truly explain how good this film is. and i can't say its flawless, but its ""flaws"" are so escarce and so minimum that the don't really matter.first thing i want to mention about this work of art is the acting performances. with a cast so stacked of stars, you would think some of them may not have the expected performances or even enough screen time (which i think is something that happened to rami malek, whose talent seemed a bit underappreciated): but it is the exact opposite. everyone's performances are top tier, charismatic, powerful, memorable. it sounds too optimistic but they really are, but this is also due to the opportunities the film offers; it's almost three hours of intense, long, fast dialogues, in an exchange of politics, philosophy and physics terminology; and i have to be very honest here, this is not a story that can be missed even a bit. you may come after a brief bathroom break and find yourself lost in the plot. but it's all worth the attention. its pace is perfect, and the three hours go by like nothing.then we have, of course, the soundtrack and the photography, two aspects that are always perfectly taken care of in nolan's films. so adecuate, so well prepared, you feel like every scene matters, you don't want to miss a single shot, a single sound.but what really surprised me and the thing i enjoyed the most is that the film talks about many other topics that are not shown in the trailer, so you come into it with an expectation and receive much more.with time, i'm sure it will be considered as a classic film, one of the best of 2020's decade, for shure.",10

"1070","oppenheimer"," chris nolan continues his war against cinemagoers buttocks","blokewithabrainuk",2023-07-23,"this movie, about one of the most significant events in the history of humanity effectively boils the entire story down to a very drawn out hr meeting to decide whether j. robert gets his security clearance revoked or not many years after the event.er... who cares?i understand that nolan chose to focus on the man rather than the event, but i think this was a mistake. three hour biopics can work (rarely), but this is no schindler's list. it is more a kitchen sink drama where the majority of the characters are one dimensional (downey junior gives it his best shot though as always), and the eponymous central character is not particularly compelling. he's interesting in a clinical kind of way but emotionally engaging, no. despite a strong performance from murphy, i simply didn't care much about the man.as a result of this focus there is little to be seen of the immense scientific endeavour of the manhattan project (the biggest ever at that point in history until the apollo programme), and there isn't much about the physics either. there could have been some real dramatic tension over the perceived race against the nazis to develop an atomic weapon, but this is only referred to a couple of times in throwaway lines.matt damon is functional, and we get to learn that robert himself was a bit of a serial shagger (that was a surprise), but again, so what? oh, he did shag a lady who was a member of the communist party, so he might be tarred by the same brush. or he might not. that is not a big enough tension to sustain a three hour movie.the trinity test is very well done. i have no quibbles about how that is realised, but again so much of the true story of how a team of four thousand scientists laboured for three years to achieve it is simply ignored.the pacing is extremely uneven. a caption announces at the beginning '1. fission'. aha, i thought, it is in three acts. but there was no caption for 2 or 3. perhaps the editor just forgot to put them in. may i suggest for a director's cut that these are '2. boom!' and '3. the hr panel interview concludes'.flabby, unfocused and really a bit dull. it could have been so much more, in so much less time.",5
"1071","oppenheimer"," a celebration of intellectual movies","heisenberg12",2023-08-07,"comic books, marvel, remakes, franchises, and garbage is the norm.no, oppenheimer is not perfect, but what people who criticize it fail to reach is that it's a rare type of movie these days. it's a historical true story, biopic, and character study. it will also be a frontrunner for best picture that will surpass in quality if it wins all best picture winners of the last ten years in terms of importance and meaningfulness.now, with that being said, here is why it is crucial. heisenberg was the key factor.my name is walter hartwell white. i live at 308 negra arroyo lane, albuquerque, new mexico, 87104. this is my confession. if you're watching this tape, i'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law hank schrader. hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. shortly after my 50th birthday, hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. connections that he made through his career with the dea. i was... astounded, i... i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was... thrown, confused, but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. and i was weak. i didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed. every day, i think back at that moment with regret. i quickly realized that i was in way over my head, and hank had a partner, a man named gustavo fring, a businessman. hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when i tried to quit, fring threatened my family. i didn't know where to turn. eventually, hank and fring had a falling out. from what i can gather, hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. fring was able to arrange, uh i guess i guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but hank was seriously injured, and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. upon recovery, hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named hector salamanca, he plotted to kill fring, and did so. in fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. i have often contemplated suicide, but i'm a coward. i wanted to go to the police, but i was frightened. hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. for 3 months he kept them. my wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what i had done, why hank had taken our children. we were scared. i was in hell, i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family. recently, i tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. i can't take this anymore. i live in fear every day that hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. i... all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.-heisenberg.",8

"1084","oppenheimer"," roundly superb, gripping, and thought-provoking (but also not without reasonable criticisms)","i_ailurophile",2024-01-28,"from the filmmaker's lofty reputation, to the exceptional and large cast, including some reliably luminous names and faces and some others that have been less frequently seen over the years; from the dourness of the subject matter, to the ardor of the production and visual effects; from the noteworthy summer release alongside greta gerwig's 'barbie,' a pairing which itself became a major phenomenon, to the incredibly high praise, awards, and nominations that have greeted the picture since: there is a world of information to digest concerning 'oppenheimer' before we ever sit to watch. this is to say nothing of questions of how christopher nolan would approach what promised to be a more straightforward drama than anything else he has made; of the extraordinary runtime, far exceeding the bounds of what was once considered customary (90-130 minutes) to embrace what increasingly seems to be a highly questionable new normal (3 hours); of condensing even a fraction of a lifetime into anything resembling a conventional cinematic feature, let alone a life as full and busy as j. robert oppenheimer's; and among far more, of whether or not it remotely deserves the label i've seen, primarily but not exclusively from critic richard roeper, hailing it as ""one of the best films of the 21st century."" so what of it? is this really everything that it's said to be?i have no qualms in saying that i disagree in some measure with the utmost stellar acclaim from which the title has benefited. it is my belief that certain lasting impressions are formed before even half an hour has passed, one-sixth the total length. one of these impressions is that the pacing is far too swift, disallowing scenes and ideas from manifesting, breathing, and resolving of their own accord; there is a vast wealth of terrific thoughts nolan poured into his adapted screenplay, and it feels far too much like the movie speeds past or around them, one after another, rather than capitalize on them. this is partly owed to jennifer lame's editing, definitely, but even individual scenes and exchanges of dialogue fly by at a gait that's overwhelming, pointing to nolan's responsibility as director. other facets suffer in turn, no matter how outstanding in and of themselves: ludwig g√∂ransson's fantastic score, ably lending to the mood at any time and considerable tension and gravitas; the tremendous acting from that awesome cast, demonstrating superb emotional depth, range, and nuance; the hard-won, laboriously produced visual effects that have themselves been the recipient of substantial praise; and more - all reduced as they present to a fraction of what they could and maybe should have been. three hours is a lot to take in, but strictly speaking, if every inclusion were as integral to the whole as we must suppose they were, and were unfailingly represented, then ideally the proceedings would have been maybe 5-10% less brisk, inherently increasing the length by ten minutes, twenty minutes, or more.it's not just about the velocity of the flick, however, but in my opinion also the surfeit of material. throughout these 180 minutes the script speaks loquaciously, and in a non-linear, back-and-forth manner, to such a bounty of notions, that even without taking into account the rapidity of the proceedings it seems to me that no one thought is given all due consideration. there's oppenheimer's magnificent intellect and highly learned mind, his education, his strident personality, and the arguable cult of personality; his associations and difficulties, be they personal, academic, professional, and/or political; the huge list of contemporary scientists, politicians, and otherwise figures whose names have gone down in history, and who all played roles of varying size, directly or indirectly, in oppenheimer's life; the manhattan project, wrapping together issues of science, ethics, logistics, personnel, bureaucracy, and more; meetings behind closed doors of further development of atomic technology, of the conflicting personalities involved, and of questioned allegiances; touches of the staggering hypocrisies and backwards priorities of the united states, enduring even today, that ever minimize the dangers of authoritarianism and fascism and exaggerate the perils of anything remotely related to leftist sociopolitical leanings; the juxtaposition of the glory of scientific achievement, the sullen horror of how that achievement is to be employed, ugly jingoism, professional pride, and personal apprehension and dread; and still more. as all these elements ebb and flow throughout the length they are more or less given equal treatment, but still the sum total feels imbalanced, and still the question remains of whether or not any of it is really given the full treatment that it deserves.i think these are very legitimate criticisms of the feature, and i'd be lying if i said that they weren't foremost in my mind as the minutes ticked by. further emphasizing the point, as a crucial moment in the course of events comes to pass, one looks at the clock to observe that there's still another full hour left. much of that last hour focuses so heavily on the latter days of oppenheimer's fame, and portraying him as having been railroaded for his views, that it almost feels as if we hadn't gotten any taste of it at all up to that point. moreover, up until that last hour the supporting cast has been seen only briefly and intermittently, and it's only within that last hour that major players like emily blunt, and robert downey jr., seem to be given the stage on which to earn the award nominations that they have. true, it's also conceivable that all this - the brusque pacing, and the overflowing content - is intentional, a meta reflection of the fast progression of events and of the significant array of facets actually in play for these historical events and figures. whatever the intent, however, the result is the same, and as far as i'm concerned the troubles i see with the movie threaten to drag down the excellence of the whole, and of every constituent part.that, i should say, would be deeply unfortunate, because while i take issue with aspects of 'oppenheimer,' make no mistake that it is, far more than not, simply brilliant. nolan gave himself a very difficult task in adapting kai bird and martin j. sherwin's biography, and in trying to cohesively weave together all the minutiae that made the man who he was, and made him be remembered as he is. bursting at the seams as the screenplay may be, and rushing almost heedlessly at some points, these figures are made out to be extremely complex, as is the story at large of which they are all part. the dialogue and scene writing are both terribly biting in the best of ways, and the sum total of the writing provides such fuel for the actors that even those in the smaller and less visible supporting parts shine luminously with the time they are given. each in their own way, blunt and downey both illustrate why they are household names and respected powerhouses; less prominent, matt damon, florence pugh, josh hartnett, rami malek, benny safdie, jason clarke, david dastmalchian, dane dehaan, alden ehrenreich, david krumholtz, and still many more all make the most of their roles. cillian murphy, a fixture for nolan and well established in his own right, gives a momentous performance to anchor the film that will surely stand as one of his greatest works as an actor. and all this, stitched together under the impeccably sharp vision of nolan as a filmmaker, results in a biographical drama that not only hits hard at the most psychological moments, stirring strong emotions, but that also evokes earnest thriller airs. this is built in such a manner that the tension and suspense is achingly real and palpable. how many other biographical flicks can say the same?yet the splendor of the title isn't just in the history it probes, the questions it asks, and the urgent thoughts it provokes. inasmuch as the material zips past too quickly for its own good i do find fault with lame's editing, yet her work is swell in and of itself, and some moments are wonderfully keen. the sound design is utterly marvelous, contributing in a big way at some key moments, and 'oppenheimer' absolutely wouldn't be the same without the fabulous efforts of willie d. burton, richard king, gary a. rizzo, kevin o'connell, and their crew. the effects really are stupendous, an immense credit to all involved, and from hair and makeup to costume design, sets, and filming locations every little detail herein that adds to the viewing experience is exemplary. there's so very much to absorb with this piece, and so very much to admire, and it's no wonder that it has been upheld as such a paragon of the cinema of 2023. at the same time, i find myself unable to unremittingly extend pure congratulations for the endeavor; great as this is by leaps and bounds, i remain put off by the flurry that it represents. i don't know what the answer might have been to ameliorate those difficulties, only that my favor is lessened for the fact of how overbearing the presentation often is, and sometimes arguably uneven. be that as it may, there's no getting around what an accomplishment the feature is for nolan, for his cast, and for everyone else who worked on it, and one would be awfully remiss not to watch given the chance. i think there are reasonable criticisms to level, yet overall 'oppenheimer' is super, and i'm happy to give it my high recommendation.",8
"1085","oppenheimer"," an important part of history","imme-van-gorp",2023-12-30,"there's no doubt that the idea of an atomic bomb feels vile and immoral, but there is also no denying that its existence (and thus, the stalemate of mutual destruction the world finds itself in now) has brought peace to our time like nothing else could have. one might call it a necessary evil or say ""the ends justify the means."" of course, that will only apply as long as these bombs don't fall into the wrong hands; hands that could ensue a chain reaction resulting in the end of the world...all in all, this was a beautiful and compelling movie with stellar acting. this movie has certainly shown me that oppenheimer was not only a true genius, but also a good person with the best intentions and perfectly human emotions and feelings.",9

"1090","oppenheimer"," christopher nolan gives us a brilliant drama with cillian murphy giving us his best performance yet, one of the best films of the decade - my ultimate review","holt344",2023-07-26,"my expectations are always high for a film made by christopher nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of j. robert oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the manhattan project, and thereby ushering in the atomic age. what we get is a three hour biopic of oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. my girlfriend thought it was too long though so i think it's a preference. you could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like strauss makes us see how others see robert oppenheimer and it only helps the story christopher nolan is telling. any fan of christopher nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and it's done perfectly. alternating between oppenheimer's story from cambridge to los alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959.cillian murphy stars as j. robert oppenheimer, with emily blunt as oppenheimer's wife katherine ""kitty"" oppenheimer; matt damon as general leslie groves, director of the manhattan project; and robert downey jr. as lewis strauss, a senior member of the united states atomic energy commission. the ensemble supporting cast includes florence pugh, josh hartnett, casey affleck, rami malek, jason clarke, gary oldman, kenneth branagh and benny safdie. the cast is full of phenomenal actors, each portraying a real figure. nolan even got matt damon out of taking a break from acting, damon's role in the film is far from the best i've seen but i'm certain he did a terrific job portraying general groves. the best performance goes to cillian murphy, hands down. he has been in multiple of christopher nolan's films and lots of others, but never in a leading role like this. peaky blinders were always the best performance which i have seen of his, but that changed with his role of j. robert oppenheimer. portraying a person who has existed and one with the reputation of oppenheimer, makes it you either fail or succeed. i'm sure cillian murphy nailed each mannerism, you see it through his performance how he pays respect to the real figure, for example the weight loss. he should be nominated for best actor and as it looks like right now, win multiple awards for the performance, the best performance of his career or so is my opinion. other performances which i really liked and found memorable, robert downey jr and matt damon to name a few. though brief, tom conti was terrific as albert einstein and i could easily see a biopic be made with him in the role.christopher nolan did it again, a film which is looking to be a huge box office success and he does it in a way which seems oddly new to hollywood, nolan never changed as it was hollywood who did. i'm of course talking about the over-reliance of cgi and visual effects. the big explosion in the film which is as real as you can get without actually blowing up a real atomic bomb, he uses practical effects and creates a stunning looking film because of it. you get immersed and the thought of things being fake never crosses your mind, because it aren't. of course there's cgi in the film but used sparingly like the shots in space. it's a visually striking movie which nolan has made and the imax only makes it so much grander. ludwig g√∂ransson is yet again working with christopher nolan and i can say they're a brilliant duo. nolan had advised him to use the violin for oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with g√∂ransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from ""the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds"". this might be ludwig's best musical score, it just might.christopher nolan began writing the script for oppenheimer after he had finished tenet, he had been envisioning the film for over 20 years before that. a primary theme of oppenheimer is dealing with the consequences of oppenheimer's actions, with nolan opting to explore how consequences can affect people in a delayed manner as he felt people are not ""necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of your action in the moment"". i just think it's a fantastic screenplay, it also worked very well with it being written in first person which was a first for the director. the writing is perfect, like so much else. if i should find something to criticize, i would say the writing for its female characters. but honestly, it's alright, i don't mind and my girlfriend didn't mind either. this is a film about oppenheimer, we get to see the story through his eyes and his eyes only, except for robert downey jr's character.richard roeper of chicago sun-times awarded oppenheimer a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as ""magnificent"" and ""one of the best films of the 21st century"". many critics share his opinion and honestly, i do too. oppenheimer is on my top three films of nolan's, the dark knight remains my favorite, but this is close to that. this might be one of the best films i've seen in the last year or two and i agree fully with ""one of the best films of the 21st century"".",10

"1100","oppenheimer"," ""oppenheimer"" impresses with its technical primacy, showing the courage, the glory and the punishment for the prometheus who delivered to us a globally deadly type of fire","fernandoschiavi",2023-12-29,"christopher nolan's film has the trinity experiment, the first nuclear bomb test explosion, as a divisive event not only for the film, but for the protagonist's arc that names the film. oppenheimer is divided into three events: two hearings (which look more like trials) followed by bombings and memories of the scientist played by cillian murphy. while robert oppenheimer's perspective is portrayed in color, the world's view of the ""father of the atomic bomb"" is seen in black and white. the choice of this photograph highlights the manichaeism placed on the scientist. not about his experiment taking the lives of thousands of people, but about his loyalty to his homeland. robert oppenheimer had people associated with the american communist party around him, which caused discomfort for the american government.at times it is tedious to follow the narrative that drags on throughout the bomb construction process. despite building tension around a race to get hold of the greatest tool before hitler's army, the film takes too long to focus on this act. although it is not the most didactic of nolan's films regarding scientific theories, the events that follow the bomb are much more intriguing than the process. the rhythm also ends up being compromised by an editing that, in addition to bringing little dynamism to the work, confuses the viewer regarding the black and white sections. it is as if the director was unable to efficiently or safely stitch together those three events within the same narrative through a non-linear construction.the fact that robert oppenheimer was a scientific theorist commanding the event whose practice would determine the course of humanity brings an unsettling ambiguity. how could the only material work of a man of reflections be so deadly? there is also a touch of leniency within the film from the other characters who constantly elevate the protagonist's status, reinforcing his genius and even justifying it through his intelligence. another issue that makes me uncomfortable is the way in which the film highlights oppenheimer's romantic conquests with the female characters that orbit him. nolan underlines this aspect of the scientist's biography, almost like a teenager entering puberty admiring a poster of his favorite rock star. this is also reflected in the way he treats the women in the narrative. kitty oppenheimer (emily blunt) steals the spotlight for herself every time she enters the scene. as does jean tatlock (florence pugh), the scientist's lover. both on screen are as powerful or more powerful than the bombs that devastated the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki. but unfortunately, their time is reduced in the plot to instrumental moments to celebrate men and their futile idealizations.speaking of futility, the highlight of the film concerns the dispute between oppenheimer and his hidden nemesis, lewis strauss (robert downey jr.). the revocation of his security clearance by the cea - united states atomic energy commission had been a trap set by strauss as a personal vendetta fueled by an episode in which strauss found himself humiliated and overshadowed by oppenheimer. we see the exposure of antagonist and protagonist in what is the best third of the film. this is the part that brings us closer to these characters. the analogy of two scorpions trapped in a bottle that will inevitably try to kill each other is brought up. this same analogy applies to belligerent nations, also commanded by men, who, faced with weapons of mass destruction, put human life at risk for equally futile reasons disguised as sovereignty and patriotism.citing some less inspired points of the narrative in the previous paragraphs, we have the birth of the bomb itself, which is a living character within the narrative, celebrating science, but also death. in the tedious process of creating this weapon, there is a repetition of the justification that it is necessary to produce it before hitler's forces - oppenheimer is of jewish origin. this race against time seems to distract those involved from the possibility of the world's destruction. the reproduction of the bomb detonation during the trinity experiment is an immersive spectacle despite the director's morbid fetish. we are mesmerized by the image of fire. silence perpetuates as we are placed in front of the shapes - almost always phallic - of the flames. then, we are swept away by the burst of sound. this delay between image and sound brings, in addition to realism, a reflection on the power of destruction. we are practically transported to the site of the explosion, and it is almost possible to feel the heat. fire consumes our gaze.it is not surprising that, considering the protagonist's important position in an essential period of history, oppenheimer's trajectory includes interactions with dozens of notorious figures, which gives nolan the opportunity to cast a cast made up of names that he would not normally accept. making appearances so brief that, at times, they almost sound like extras - such as kenneth branagh, casey affleck, jack quaid, matthew modine, rami malek and gary oldman -, which sometimes distracts more than it adds to the production. on the other hand, robert downey jr. and matt damon take advantage of the opportunity to play very different types of their usual roles: the latter, evoking the rigidity and discipline of a military veteran; the first, embracing the bitterness and insecurities of a man without any trace of the youthfulness that the actor usually brings to his characters. meanwhile, florence pugh intensely projects tatlock's psychological instability without allowing it to define that woman, while emily blunt escapes the trap of embodying the resentful wife stereotype by lending kitty an interesting frustration with her husband's apparent passivity, which leads her to adopt a combative and brave stance.none of these performances would work, however, if the emotional center of the film did not feature the impeccable work of cillian murphy, who contrasts oppenheimer's apparent rationality with his ideological, romantic and sexual passions that often lead him to commit impulsive acts (or make reckless statements) that make him unpredictable and, consequently, fascinating. it is intriguing, for example, to see him abandon his calm and discreet manner as he becomes excited by his students' academic interest, also displaying an inability to resist his desire for tatlock and even his admiration for the irreducible principles that - notice the irony - keep it unreachable. in a similar way, the actor manages the feat of reconciling the subject's scientific obsession with creating the bomb and his humanist resistance to using it after it was built without this sounding like pure demagoguery or hypocrisy.using hoyte van hoytema's excellent photography to visually distinguish the narrative approach between oppenheimer's subjectivity and a more distant (not necessarily objective) view of his life, the film jumps respectively between sequences shot in color and black-and-white - and the fact that much of the latter focus on strauss also ends up establishing an important subtext about his worldview and that of the title character's more comprehensive view. furthermore, the fabulous score composed by ludwig goransson is skillful in bringing harmonies that seem to see oppenheimer's scientific epiphanies as something almost poetic, transcendental, seeing beauty in what could be restricted to equations and cold descriptions about the nature of nuclear fission. to top it off, jennifer lame's editing goes beyond the simple chronological break, employing almost abstract inserts that illustrate the protagonist's insights and offer a gateway into the way his mind operates.unlike most of nolan's filmography, which typically puts its efforts more into elaborating plots and less into the detailed development of the figures that move them, ""oppenheimer"" can in some ways be considered a character study - and even though the events of nolan's life physical aspects are relevant to the script, the filmmaker maintains the focus on the atmosphere of the narrative (at least, as perceived/felt by the protagonist). here and there, of course, there is a certain exaggeration (i'm not sure that including the image of oppenheimer naked and having sex with tatlock in the room where he is being forced to discuss his intimacy is necessary, reinforcing in the viewer something that he had already understood), but in general, these more expressive interventions help the public get closer to a figure who could easily remain an indecipherable enigma. the moral aspects of the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki are not at all ambiguous in the film's view, which disapproves of both the cynicism of the north american government (and military) - such as using the term ""artifact"" in place of ""bomb"" - as for his justifications for the attack, since germany had surrendered months earlier and japan was heading towards the same end. (i discussed this view - defended by many contemporary historians - in this post on my blog.) not that the work seeks to absolve oppenheimer, as he himself made a point of condemning himself, but the harshest looks are those aimed at politicians and military personnel directly. involved in the decision to use the bombs, which includes the harry s. truman that gary oldman embodies as a proud and xenophobic scoundrel (which he actually was).despite giving up action, ""oppenheimer"" also impresses with its technical primacy, especially in relation to editing and sound mixing, valuing the viewer's perception and intelligence by delivering in the right measure everything that is necessary to understand the genius and torment of that which gave humanity the opportunity to make... humanity no longer existed. the courage, the glory and the punishment for the prometheus who delivered to us a globally deadly type of fire.",8
"1101","oppenheimer"," politics of the bomb","redcanofevil",2023-07-21,"might sound absolutely blasphemous but i think this is better watched at home. this is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional oscar bait. there are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. the soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. what i expected from it was not what i walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. so be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. if you are not already aware of exactly what happened to oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. and then if you are already aware of everything that happened to oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? the whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. i'm talking about the bomb obviously, i was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. the saving grace was the amazing acting performance by rdj and emily blunt who both should be receiving oscar nominations. cillian murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where i felt like i was watching tommy shelby instead of robert oppenheimer. the best part of watching cillian murphy as oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what nolan was going for. there is surprisingly little of the nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". this was easier to follow and harder to watch than tenet.rating: 7.5/10.",7
"1102","oppenheimer"," did i miss something?","jamiewalton",2023-08-19,"i was a huge fan of christopher nolan for years, but went off him following tenet - a film that seemed like nolan on autopilot and exposed his worst flaws. so, despite the massive critical acclaim surrounding this film, i feel my expectations were actually quite low.yet, somehow, i was still disappointed.nolan is a great director, but he works better when somebody else is taking the lead creatively. the script is a mess and often avoids following the most basic principles of writing, leaving nothing in their place.you might think, based on the trailer, that the film is focused on oppenheimer developing the first atom bomb. and i wish it was. that's actually the middle third or so of them film. it's the best section of the film, but there are so many people thrown at the screen in such a short space of time that none of them are developed or especially (outside of a decent line here and there) memorable.outside of that, we follow oppenheimer on a breakneck tour of well-known scientists, most of whom serve no purpose. take his meeting with schrodinger. it's basically the two of them saying 'hi' to each other and then we never see him again.the bulk of the film (about two thirds) is devoted to people sitting around talking about oppenheimer. it can be summed up as: 'he's brilliant, but can he be trusted?' repeated for almost two hours. robert downey jr is in these sequences (he has nothing to do with the middle part of the film) and i'm not knocking his acting, but for a character with so much screen time he was exceedingly uninteresting. oppenheimer made fun of him and now he doesn't like oppenheimer, and that's his entire motivation for being the film's antagonist.focusing more on the atom bomb project and taking time on the other scientists would have made for a much stronger and interesting film. oh, except then the film couldn't be cut into a random order, which is apparently clever.i've seen so much praise for nolan's work here, but i felt like even he felt the film was lacking. for around the first half of the film, there are random shots of explosions and stars with loud noises, as though he realised people might get bored. and, as is well known by now, nolan mistakenly thinks that too loud = intense and that intense = good. there's no purpose for them, and i guess they stopped at a certain point because nolan figured anybody who was still watching would be staying until the end.cillian murphy gives a fantastic performance, but once again i felt it was let down by the writing. i never felt enveloped in the story or especially cared for his troubles.a big problem this film had to overcome is we know that oppenheimer was successful. if nolan had got me really involved, i still would've been enthralled, but i never felt that interested.it's got an amazing cast who incredible performances and it looks amazing, but it was boring, and that's the worst thing a film can be.",4
"1103","oppenheimer"," or: lewis strauss meets the theoretical physical godzilla","quinoa1984",2023-07-24,"a full throated, adult - i mean to say perfectly serious - epic story about american exceptionalism and how that is more likely than not a total crock; what the film is truly about, at least in my immediate estimation before i sleep on it, is how easily it is to make many, many enemies in a country that is at superpower status in a world where nazism can fold and then communism (or just you know anyone the government disagrees with) can be next. it's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it.what i think made nolan really want to make this a reality, aside from oppenheimer being an endlessly fascinating collection of mixed emotions and thoughts and genius and ""blood on my hands"" level of guilt, is how power is so completely at the mercy of who gets to be in control - and what it means for a fubdamentaly decent person to reckon with the power to destroy (the apple scene early on is an apt metaphor). the branaugh line about giving the world the power to destroy itself, and not being prepared. it's even more than that: some may think they are prepared, while others just try to wash their hands with it. and all the while, you are plunged and plugged into a first-person perspective like few others this high-wired and singular (taxi driver is in this league). haunting, really.lots and lots of thoughts on this i still need to digest, but easily nolan's greatest achievement at least as a writer - the dialog is constantly involving and urgent and dramatically alive (and just fun to listen to) in ways i'm not sure i've experienced from him, and the structure is going to keep me going back to it another half dozen times in the next year or two - and downey jr, among a titanic heavyweight cast ranging from gary oldman to macon blair, almost steals the movie from everyone as a world class shitbag (or, your typical dc power-player who got scorned once). and the ending is devastating.some more thoughts on a second viewing: i know jfk gets brought up in reviews and with critics (and even nolan himself), but i thought of born on the fourth of july for the set piece when oppenheimer gives the speech; when ron kovic talks to the 4th of july crowd and all the sound drops out except for a baby crying and helicopters, it's a subjective perspective of ptsd to an extreme.i think oppenheimer has that as well, and it's a traumatic sequence that really got to me on a second viewing, not only the blinding white light and the woman with tatters on her face, but the subjects as he's stumbling out who are a) making out, b) crying, c) vomiting, and other things. it's astonishing the degree there and at a few other key points where nolan means to break apart his mind through his editing and camerawork.and after all oppenheimer is a theoretical physicist who thought he could maintain himself with what he was doing, and he absolutely could not.... but then i think nolan's point here, as stone maybe had with initially deluded boy scout kovic and vietnam, is that... who can ever face that? it's bigger than everyone on a psychic level. it's about how science and politics can't be compatible. that's chilling to me.nitpick on this rewatch: florence pugh is not given a lot to work with past ""i'm kind of batty and tragic,"" and while emily blunt gets more to do and is terrific, and i dont mean to say pugh phones it in on what she's asked to do, it seems kind of reductive that she is more of a story device. this doesn't mean she doesn't have a pivotal moment - i don't mean necessarily *that* line - the dialog right before it, where oppy tells her about nearly poisoning his professor. is he jungian? is he that kind of helmet from full metal jacket, born to kill and peace symbol? not quite, it's more complicated than that... or maybe so simple. which makes that pugh's isadora and her small role more difficult to accept.or, to put it into comparison with the aviator, which is strangely another film i thought of this time (not just because nolan at one time wanted to make a hughes biopic, rather both films deal with subjects who have mania and horrible weights on their shoulders, this one though far more grave), if blunt is katherine hepburn than pugh is ava gardner. oh, well.",10

"1105","oppenheimer"," complicated theatrical rendition of a complicated individual","drqshadow-reviews",2024-01-04,"with oppenheimer, his first biopic, writer/director christopher nolan once again proves he's up to the challenge of balancing a difficult subject matter with a very tricky character piece. the slow, careful process of scientific discovery is rarely friendly to film, and shy, socially-awkward introverts do not often make for compelling leads, but in this case nolan juggles both and steps away smelling like roses. as he'd already done on more than one occasion, in decidedly different flavors.here we track the career of a famed theoretical physicist, thrust into the limelight as the so-called ""father of the atom bomb"" during the crush of world war 2 and then dismissed by an ungrateful government after he'd outlived his usefulness and started asking difficult follow-up questions. oppenheimer's frustrated early career, meteoric rise to fame and equally rapid fall from grace are depicted almost simultaneously, in a rush of confused, overlapped memories. this style of all-at-once storytelling, in which foreshadowing coexists with its own outcome, is reminiscent of the time-blurred motifs we've already seen in tenet, inception and dunkirk. here it serves as a compelling way to digest a lot of information in a very short amount of time, especially when paired with a head-spinning series of metaphorical visual effects and an entrancing musical score. i've read the book this film was based upon, a daunting 800-page tome, and after the first hour i felt like i'd just read most of it all over again. this time with a little extra dramatic pizazz.it's an impressive display of top-notch filmmaking, proficiently depicting a historical scenario in which everyone already knows the ending and climaxing with a tense, powerful visualization of the trinity tests which first loosed the power of violent nuclear fission upon the world. i loved every moment, but then, i was already deeply invested in the subject and had done some homework. my wife, far less prepared, was also far less enchanted. i think this may be more of a knock on oppenheimer the man than oppenheimer the film. a complicated, often misguided individual who, for all his brilliance within the hidden world of molecular physics, was inherently flawed and broken in a human sense. nolan makes no apology for this, baring the person (and his many blemishes) to the screen with no filter, and the results aren't always pretty.perhaps a bit too long, especially in the painfully bitter, sixty-minute postscript, but i'm not sure where i'd want to see a cut. certainly not a feel-good audience pleaser, nolan's latest is an exhausting experience, but also rich, thoughtful and rewarding.",9

"1115","oppenheimer"," haunting tale of haunted triumph","rickchatenever",2023-11-14,"christopher nolan's ""oppenheimer"" is a tale of triumph and apocalypse, as haunting and haunted as the man whose story it tells.j. robert oppenheimer was the brilliant theoretical physicist chosen to lead america's world war ii effort to build an atomic bomb before adolph hitler did. for many filmgoers, writer-director nolan's three-hour thriller provides the introduction to this world-changing figure. he was dubbed ""the father of the a-bomb"" by a grateful, war-weary america, but a few years later fell victim to mccarthy era character assassination for his left-leaning political views.for me, the movie is not only sweeping and magnificent - it's personal. oppenheimer was a name i knew well, ever since boyhood.my father, dr. alfred chatenever, was one of the scientists who worked on the top-secret program to develop the bomb, dubbed the manhattan project. the project eventually stretched across the country all the way to the tiny town of los alamos, secretly constructed from the ground up in the middle of nowhere, new mexico. but my dad's assignment kept him in manhattan, working in a clandestine lab hidden in a converted parking garage.all of this was highly classified at the time. my dad couldn't even tell his wife what he did, or explain to anyone else why he wasn't with the rest of the boys over there in europe or the south pacific. but in the years following the war, all three chatenever kids eventually heard the stories. we knew the players destined for key roles in nolan's complex narrative - not just oppenheimer, but other scientists including albert einstein, nils bohr, werner heisenberg and edward teller. and army general leslie groves, who oversaw the two-billion-dollar project - that's billions in 1940s dollars - and personally picked oppenheimer to guide it.stops on chatenever family summer road trips in the '50s included oak ridge, tennessee, another city built in secret, to house laboratories and facilities to enrich the uranium needed for the bomb. on another trip, we visited los alamos itself.like oppenheimer, our dad carried the weight of the bomb on his conscience for the rest of his life. true, it ended world war ii ... but it also ushered in a new age perhaps more lethal in its ultimate consequences than the firestorm explosions that leveled the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki, claiming more than 100,000 lives.working on the bomb had been a moral imperative at the time. many of the scientists were jewish, knowing all too well the consequences if hitler got the bomb first. but once it was clear that germany's efforts wouldn't succeed, the prospect of whether or not to drop the bomb on japan became far more ambiguous. a number of top scientists on the project signed a petition urging president harry truman not to use the weapon.it was all grist for the mill in discussions around the chatenever dinner table. so i had a leg up before setting foot in the theater to see christopher nolan's version of these events based on the book ""american prometheus"" by kai bird and martin j. sherwin.in the lead role, irish actor cillian murphy doesn't portray oppenheimer so much as he resurrects the boundless genius and many failings of this complex man. trained at harvard, oxford and germany's university of gottingen, oppenheimer received his phd at age 23. he introduced america to quantum physics, and spoke six languages including sanskrit, but might as well have been wearing one of those t-shirts embossed with the words ""i'm with stupid,"" atop an arrow pointing at his crotch. his activities supporting leftist causes would also come back to haunt him when an intellectual rival louis strauss (robert downey jr.) targeted oppenheimer out of a misplaced sense of betrayal.the genius of oppenheimer and his peers was accompanied by mighty egos, deep insecurities and rock-star vanity.just keeping track of all the details of the story would be daunting enough, before trying to recreate the sights, sounds and textures of '40s and '50s america so authentically. but filmmaker nolan further complicates matters with a nonlinear script, sometimes in color, sometimes in black and white, that jumps back and forth between key incidents - both high and low - in its protagonist's career.every detail of nolan's screen artistry shimmers with blinding brilliance, like micro glimpses of the staggering power unleashed by splitting an atom. atoms, of course, are invisible to the naked eye, but ""oppenheimer"" makes invisible things visible, just as it takes us into the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century and helps us see what they saw.in a movie season generally devoted to mindless action for the dumbed-down masses, it's a thrilling work of intellect and taut excitement, providing lessons in history and science against panoramic backgrounds worthy of a classic western.cillian murphy's star turn is not the only great performance in ""oppenheimer."" emily blunt as his alcoholic but ultimately tough-as-nails wife kitty, is superb. so is matt damon's leslie groves, whose exchanges with oppenheimer feel electrically charged. oscar winners like kenneth branagh and rami malek show up in cameos, attesting to the quality in every facet of nolan's grand design that's only slightly less ambitious than the manhattan project itself.when the los alamos scientists successfully exploded their first bomb prototype in a test labeled trinity, oppenheimer is said to have recited from memory a sanskrit passage from the hindu spiritual text the bhagavad gita:
if the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst in the sky,

"1116","oppenheimer"," great biopic about a man who changed everything","reviews_of_the_dead",2023-08-07,"this was a movie that i was intrigued when i heard it was coming out. i do enjoy christopher nolan's films. i'm a bigger fan of cillian murphy though. i knew that this was a speculate so i was trying to see how i could fit this into my schedule. the three-hour runtime was daunting as well. the gateway film center has been showing this on 70mm so i wanted to see it that way. the stars aligned on a sunday for me to catch this.now i'll be honest, i didn't know a lot about j. robert oppenheimer ahead of seeing this. i made the connection that he was part of the manhattan project, but outside of what happened with the atomic bomb being dropped twice on japan and looking up a few things ahead of seeing this, i was a blank slate. murphy does an amazing job at taking on this role. this could be his career defining performance to be honest.he's also surrounded by an amazing cast. his second wife is kitty (emily blunt). he was also married to the amazing florence pugh who takes on the role of jean tatlock. that's just for his personal life. robert brought quantum physics to the united states so we see him studying in europe and meeting the likes of werner heisenberg (matthias schweigh√∂fer) and niels bohr (kenneth branagh). we also see how smart robert is and driven when he puts his mind to something.to just give a bit more about what this story is doing, we have two threads. the first is for the manhattan project to succeed in creating the bomb ahead of the germans. there is also the concern with sharing too little or too much with the soviets who were in the beginning an ally. robert rubbed elbows with communists, but he never truly joined them. it was a fearful time though and mccarthyism was in full effect. the other tense thread involves lewis strauss (robert downey jr.) who wants to become a cabinet member. he hired oppenheimer, but the two butted heads. lewis plays the puppet master in getting robert to lose his security clearance. this has greater ramifications as well.aside from the names i've given here, we also have the likes of scott grimes, jason clarke, tony goldwyn, james d'arcy, david krumholtz, alex wolff, david dastmalchian, matt damon, dane dehaan, jack quaid, gustaf skarsg√•rd, oliva thirlby, casey affleck, remi malak and james remar. i'm sure there's more as well, but that was a quick glance over the names.where i'll leave off is that this is a tense movie about history. did i need to see this in 70mm? probably not, but i get to say that i did. there is an arthouse flair while still directing to the mainstream. will this win awards? i believe that it will. it might not make as much as barbie, which came out the same day. i will bet this is the better of the two movies. it's just not for everyone. this is a sad and uplifting tale of a man who was extremely important to the world of science and changed the world like none other. see this movie.my rating: 9 out of 10.",9
"1117","oppenheimer"," very good; not a masterpiece","shadhuahmed",2023-11-17,"stripped of all the usual hype that accompanies a new nolan release and the whole barbenheimer hoopla surrounding it, the film itself is not exactly groundbreaking. don't get me wrong, i know it's a monumental achievement in terms of box office success, and it's a fine film. but storytelling-wise, there's nothing here that hasn't been done before with less pretension.i don't think splitting it up in black-and-white and color segments (√† la memento) was really of much help to the audience as much as it was to the filmmakers themselves. and i wish nolan wasn't so hung-up on packaging it as a thriller. the frenetic editing throughout, the constant droning of violins and electronic beats in the background to make sure the ones with short attention spans never check out of the film, and the sloppy transitions in the moments where oppie has visions of the world beyond and his past and future fumbles almost took me out of the movie.but it was a relief to see robert downey jr. going all-out in flexing his acting chops after playing the same character during the most robust period of his acting career.nevertheless, out of the most remarkable battery of cast and crew that worked on this project, if i was given the chance to pick only one name whose work was indelible to the unique set of feelings this film enkindles, it would be the composer ludwig g√∂ransson. his score is unconventional and welcoming at the same time. it is alienating, yet it guides you through the range of emotions the characters experience, unfailingly.and those who complained that they didn't understand most of the movie were simply not au fait with the general history of the manhattan project and the trials of the central character. you don't need to know everything about oppenheimer (and there's barely 15 minutes of hardcore physics jargon in the entire film) to understand what's going on; watching a decent documentary on the subject before going in should've more than sufficed (i'd suggest the pbs america special ""the trials of j. robert oppenheimer""). not having english subtitles in theatres didn't help non-native english speakers much either, i guess, which was even compounded by the weird sound-mixing fetishes of nolan.but the most obvious deterrent to the enjoyment of this movie is the fact that audiences the world over have probably simply lost the patience to sit through a movie that employs the most basic of cinematic apparatus to tell a story: people talking to each other and sorting stuff out; in other words, unadulterated drama.it's just sad that a film like this needs promotional gimmicks like ""all practical, no cgi!"" and ""witness a script written in first person!"" to put more butts in theatre seats.",NA

"1147","oppenheimer"," ""can you hear the music?""","aziz24",2023-07-29,"synopsis: oppenheimer handles a huge project of the creation of the atomic bomb that leads to all kinds of consequences on his personal life and many others surrounding him. this leads him to be the father of the atomic bomb and ""the destroyer of worlds"" as he becomes one of the most important figures in history.directed by christopher nolan and starring cillian murphy as robert oppenheimer himself in a lead role for the first time in a nolan film, after being in most of his films. cillian murphy looks nothing like the real robert oppenheimer physically. yet, murphy is able to portray the famous figure in a role that would lead him to win an academy award easily. from facial expressions to cillian murphy's wide eyes that are capable of speaking without him having to say a word and how they also can express guilt, regret, sadness, confusion, and all sorts of feelings that oppenheimer went through while completing the complex project of the atomic bomb. as well as, the support of the make up and hair design department, audience members are able to capture oppenheimer in three different stages of his life, young version, middle aged version, and an older version of the character. after his role in the tv show peaky blinders (2013 - 2022) as thomas shelby, his popularity grew and everyone sees him as shelby. however, after watching this film, audience members will easily forget that and a new image will be created in everyone's head as him being robert j oppenheimer.robert downey jr. as lewis strauss gives such a heavy and top tier acting role that his presence can be heavily felt on screen and in the events and the different stages that his character goes through. it is by far the second best acting role in the film after cillian murphy's, it is for sure oscar worthy for best supporting actor. same thing will cillian's image among fans, rdj has the image of tony stark/ironman in everyone's head. everyone has gotten used to seeing him as that superhero who flies and shoots lasers from his hands. but, that image can e easily forgotten after watching this film. i am not denying every great thing he did for the role of tony stark/iron man as i am a huge fan of it. but, this film reminds everyone of who rdj really is as the actor who is able to portray and put on some great acting skills and oscar worthy performance like he used to before as harry lockhart in kiss kiss bang bang (2005), charles chaplin in chaplin (1992), or paul avery in zodiac (2007).on the other hand, matt damon as leslie groves is the only role that added nothing to the table compared to everyone else's appearance. even though he has a huge screen time and he plays an important role in the story, some other actors have less screen time than him and they did a better job. like rami malek and edward teller.emily blunt as kitty oppenheimer, rami malek as david hill, and alden ehrenreich as senate aide throughout the whole film, do not have a scene that would put the spotlight on them and make them noticeable until we reach towards the end in which all of them will have their time, their moment, and their scene to shine which what made those scenes very special specifically because of their acting skills.in addition, there are so many other actors that appeared in the film (some are a surprise) in which they all have some great scenes and great acting skills that will lead them to shine in their scene and i will refuse to mention them to avoid any spoilers and it would rather be better if you walk into this movie not knowing that they will make an appearance.the film deals with sound effects in the most amazing way especially in moments of silence whenever the film focuses on oppenheimer's point of view and what goes through his head in terms of fear, regret and confusion like heavy breathing, screams or countdowns.on the other hand, the film's sound mixing is horrible to the point that it may holdback a viewer's experience and understanding of the events of the film due to the struggle of hearing the dialogue. it's either their voice can hardly be heard, or the music at most times is louder than the speech. this is not a first time for a nolan film as films like tenet (2020) and the dark knight (2012) have a very similar issue in terms of hearing the speech.not to mention that the music score - that was louder than the speech at most times - is greatly composed by ludwig g√∂ransson who returns again with nolan as he composed tenet (2020) in which the similarities can be heard between both tenet (2020) and oppenheimer (2023). there is a specific tone and vibe that ludwig g√∂ransson used in both films to deliver the film in the way it should be. however, many have surprisingly compared ludwig g√∂ransson's work in oppenheimer (2023) to hans zimmer's work in previous nolan films like in interstellar (2014) by specifically comparing ludwig g√∂ransson's music piece ""can you hear the music"" in oppenheimer to hans' ""s. t. a. y"" in interstellar (2014). in my opinion, this is a totally unfair compression as ludwig g√∂ransson's work is nothing compared to hans' work. that does not mean that ludwig g√∂ransson work is not that good but i just think that comparing what hans zimmer did lowers hans' work quality as well as ludwig g√∂ransson's work.when promoting the film, it is suggested that seeing it in imax 70mm is a must which hyped everything as expectations has risen that audience members will probably experience something similar to interstellar when it comes to the visuals and the cinematography. yet, most of the film is literally being shot indoors with no room for visually stunning shots to even be introduced and present because the film depends on dialogues in the first place.but, does that mean that seeing in imax 70mm was not worth it? no
does that mean that i don't recommend everyone to go see it in imax 70mm (the format it is suppose to be seen in)? no
because, how often do film directors release films that are shot using imax cameras and are offered in imax 70mm (film imax and not digital imax)? it's probably once every 2-3 years. therefore, i do highly recommend anyone to see it in imax 70mm film for the full experience and i promise it won't disappoint and the next time a film will be offered in imax 70mm will provably be in 2 or 3 years. but, i really was hoping and expecting an interstellar or avatar (2009), type of cinematography.the story of robert j oppenheimer isn't as complicated as how it is being introduced in this film. but, isn't the way that nolan introduced and made this whole biography film different, unique and more complicated than other biography films, is what truly makes nolan a unique film director?this is the first time that nolan does a biography/based on a true story type of film and im more than glad that he did it, because i'm 100% positive that any other filmmaker would've turned it into an ordinary, usual and typical biography film without including any complications or mind blowing twists like christopher nolan.my rating is 9.5/10 (might change on 2nd viewing)

all the love scenes and affairs (jean tatlock) are just a cover. did nolan want to get the female audience involved? this film is all about men, it has little to do with women or family, really. i do not mean this is in a mean way, it is just not what is important to oppenheimer.robert downey jr. character schwartz is often boring. he tells us little, just a small bureaucrat (shoe salesman) that wants his career in the white house and is willing to go over oppenheimers dead body for that. of course this character is important, but do we need to see so much of him? and why is is not at all relatable?instead of showing some footage of the real drop of the bombs on nagasaki and hiroshima, there is a theatre scene with oppenheimer as the speaker to state that japan was a ""success"". the audience gets grilled by the nuclear flash to illustrate the drama of mass murdership. the audience will understand this trick, however i think one should have invested in the real tragedy and show parts of the real thing to make it more credible why oppenheimer starts to develop his guilt complex. like flashbacks. this was a bit too surreal to me.i leave it a this, but clearly this time chris nolan had no time to really reconsider if the movie should be really different from the book american prometheus. there was no dramatic rewrite, instead he filmed every page. that did not help the audience.despite that, i can only say that watching the whole movie has 2 genuine scenes, that make it all worthwhile:gary oldman is incredible as truman. just some sentences and suddenly all self questionaires about guilt are ridicolous with oppenheimer. it was trumans decision to drop the bombs, not oppenheimers. oppenheimer is confused if his decision to run the project was really that important or not. could he have avoided the nuclear arms race that was to follow or the bomb drops on japan? truman says no, you are just a project leader on nuclear bombs, i run the show. but how he says that - fantastic!the finale with einstein: as usual einstein is presented as a loveable character. but it helps! when you see the teddybear being shocked by what oppenheimer says to him about the world burning, it is touching. when einstein turns and walk away, it is as if the atheist einstein finally is angry with god about the faith of mankind. in that respect, a einstein movie that was serious would have been the more interesting protagonist.maybe one has to watch the whole movie to feel the emotional rollercoaster that enfolds with these two scenes. maybe not. as a film, oppenheimer cannot compare to previous movies - maybe it would have been best to shoot a documentary instead.",7

"1163","oppenheimer"," a challenging viewing experience, but powered by the performances.","drawlife",2023-07-31,"one of the most anticipated films of this year and who better to deliver the film none other than christopher nolan. nolan makes the audience think, and i think for me at least it will click better with a second viewing much like dunkirk or tenent. nevertheless the shoulders of this film is carried by cillian murphy who finally gets to showcase his talents as a lead. he's always been a treat to watch on screen and i'm very happy for him. he deserves all the praise.murphy channels oppenheimer incredibly well. he acts with his eyes and his face. throughout the film you're not in doubt with what he's thinking and what he's feeling as he never really expresses his feelings until the aftermath of his invention. murphy effortlessly anchors the entire 3 hour film and it is a surefire oscar nomination. he's consistently brilliant in almost anything he does and i think this film will put him on top of everest.robert downey jr. i think could potentially get an nomination as well. after an incredible decade of being iron man, he's able to show off his other talents reminiscent of his pre-iron man days. he disappears into the role of lewis strauss and he takes every opportunity to show strauss's two-faced nature, patiently biding his time to strip oppenheimer of his good reputation. to my surprise, josh harnett has a meaty role as ernest lawrence and it's nice to see him on screen again. matt damon brings his a-game as major general leslie groves. he's a no-nonsense military character, but also rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. the unlikely alliance between the two is a treat to watch as murphy and damon have a good dynamic together.emily blunt and florence pugh contribute to the story as his wife kitty oppenheimer and jean tatlock, respectively. to me i saw these two as a reminder of oppenheimer's character flaws as he was not perfect. they represented something significant in oppenheimer's life, kitty being who he should be with, but jean being someone he wants to be with. also being that this is a nolan film, no part is a small part, so there are a lot of incredibly talented and well recognized actors playing other historic figures and people of importance, so it was kind of fun to see who pops up as who for their glorified, but layered and important cameos.in true nolan fashion, this isn't a conventional biopic. it's told in non-sequential order highlighting specific points in oppenheimer's life jumping from places to places. for some this is the make or break for the film. i do think one has to be an experienced viewer of film to keep up with the non-linear storytelling, but again nolan is very resourceful with the way he does this so it never really feels like you're too lost. i will admit though i do think i would have preferred something a little bit more conventional for my tastes. i liked the flow more when there were moments to marinate things happening in chronological order as opposed to jumping around and to nolan's credit, he does this near the last hour or so. this is where i also felt the film is at its best when it focused on the psychological thriller aspect. there's one sequence in involving a speech that's particularly terrifying as you can feel oppenheimer's horror and remorse. it also manages to have some very suspenseful moments leading up to the completion of the bomb and when they begin to test it, it is very gripping when you don't expect it to be.production design is incredible, the attention to detail is also impeccable. kudos to production designer ruth de jong who also has experience in period pieces like there will be blood. creating a look and feel to a time that's long gone may seem so simple and easy to do on the surface, but i cannot imagine the challenges the crew had to face, making sure everything was on point to that era. from costumes, buildings, set design, cars, etc. you feel transported to that time. it's also shot in a way that is also very immersive by hoyte van hoytema, making this his fourth collaboration with nolan. music is composed by ludwig g√∂ransson, who also killed it with black panther and mandalorian. he is definitely going to get some praise for his work here.this film almost touches on greatness, if it were not for it's length and time jumps. the movie is overly dense as it tries to bundle too much of oppenheimer's pre and post-trinity life into one movie. i also do think if you're a history buff it will be a more enjoyable experience, but for those who aren't too familiar with the subject, it is something that might be harder to digest with its first viewing. i do personally think somewhere in this film, there is a phenomenal 2.5 hour cut, but oppenheimer is still a powerful biopic that explores and shows the dark side of human nature, powered by a tour-de-force performance from cillian murphy. another landmark achievement from christopher nolan.8/10.",8
"1164","oppenheimer"," brilliant performances, brilliant direction, but multiple viewings required","talking_about_movies",2023-07-24,"the much awaited historical entry from one of my favourite directors, christopher nolan, is finally out. it's being well received from critics and audiences alike. after watching it, i can say it more or less deserves that reception.i did have the fear of not understanding this movie. nolan has a habit of making his films as ground-breaking as possible. he doesn't want his movies to feel normal. he speeds up his storytelling and makes his dialogue scenes as brief as possible to keep the audience's brain working the whole time. so yes, in this film too, there are things that i missed. i understood the story, but i missed many character details that were thrown at me very fast in multiple different scenes. and i'm not sure whether this story even needed the non-linear way in which it was told here. you'll need multiple viewings to fully understand this film.let's now talk about everything else. the story is available through various forms of media already. so i don't think anything new was written into this movie. what this movie had to do though, was to show this existing story. that it did - through brilliant direction, phenomenal performances, jaw-dropping soundtracks and the intensity that all of them brought to the story. cillian murphy's portrayal of the psychological effects on oppenheimer, and nolan's vision made a scintillating combo. in fact there are so many brilliant performances here - jason clarke, robert downey jr, matt damon, emily blunt, all of them give some intense performances. ludwig goransson's score is just chilling (the composer of black panther). there are so many scenes here that just gave me goosebumps. there's a scene where jason clarke's character is arguing with oppenheimer, and that entire scene was just amazingly performed and made by everyone. there's also the trinity test scene which was brilliantly directed by nolan. there are many such scenes.overall i do think this is a great movie, but i'll definitely have to watch it again to believe that. it's great to see a historical drama be so successful at the theatres.edit: rewatched, and yes, i fully believe that this is a brilliant movie.",9
"1165","oppenheimer"," stunning, thought-provoking, brilliant","azmark1887",2023-12-27,"nolan's ""oppenheimer"" is a momentous achievement, an engrossing film stunning in its art direction, cinematography, musical score, and sound direction; rhetorically clear though its narrative is dense and circuitous at times, and successful in bringing to life the paradoxical achievements, complex personality, and flesh and blood humanity of one of the 20th century's most brilliant, driven, and controversial scientists.through a non-linear story that moves forward despite numerous flashbacks and flashforwards over three hours, the film holds its center by using a tremendously talented ensemble cast of scientists, spouses, and bureaucrats to illustrate the race to beat germany in developing a weapon that would end world war ii.as niels bohr (kenneth branagh) says to a young oppenheimer, shown as a floundering graduate student in experimental physics at cambridge university, you don't have to read the score if you can hear the music when encouraging the young scientist to not worry about his lack of skills in complex mathematics, the audience doesn't need to understand the equations of quantum physics to follow the story of a world-altering scientific achievement and the resulting political fallout.cillian murphy is mesmerizing as the egotistical, self-absorbed, ambitious yet compassionate, charming, and brooding genius who is troubled by visions of a universe governed by probabilities as much as physical laws, concerned with the plight of workers, intellectually curious well beyond his chosen field, and reckless and na√Øve in his romances and friendships. supporting roles are well played by emily blunt, florence pugh, josh hartnett, alden ehrenreich, matt damon, and a nearly unrecognizable robert downey jr., who is superb in a supporting role.expect numerous oscar nominations and several wins for this latest project by writer/director nolan who, perhaps more than any writer/director of his generation other than denis villeneuve, so skillfully melds 20th-century cinema staples of location, staging, costuming, music, photography, and great storytelling with 21st-century technology.",10

"1170","oppenheimer"," calmly astounding","africanbro",2023-07-24,"in recent years, usually when a film has such a packed cast it often never met expectations so i didn't have many for this, i was confident it was gonna be good but refrained from gauging how good it could actually be. quoting greek mythology really set the tone for the rest of the movie. christopher nolan is known for blending some sci-fi to his more renowned movies; this is a history biopic but has a lot of elements resembling sci-fi. building something that at the time period, could only be a pigment of one's imagination. the movie blends together mythology, physics, betrayal, history, philosophy, politics and moral conundrums... maybe this is recency bias but i think this is one of christopher nolan's best work.it doesn't climax how i expected it, and in the end, even though the movie heavily involves the word war and is heavily influenced by war drama, more so us's bombing of japan, the bomb itself isn't the main focus of the story, although i felt that the movie was leading us there for the first half. there's a lot more to the story and that can be seen as there's still a good chunk of runtime left after the bombing. everything before that moment, which was a lot, seemed like it was there to help understand oppenheimer more and the moral dilemmas he faced and how it changed him. i really lost track of time, but before what i think is the last hour of the movie, i thought the movie was about oppenheimer's bomb, but by the end of the movie you go back to remembering it's a biopic on oppenheimer himself. an excellent one at that, that almost out any other biopic to shame in my recent memory.the story is told from oppenheimer perspective, well the colored scenes not the black and white ones which were impartial. we get to see him plagued by guilt and internal turmoil he faced about his betrayal; which was a reoccurring theme throughout the movie, not just to/from oppenheimer but so many in the film. mostly about dealing with the consequences of his success, as he's haunted by visions of an apocalypse he helped orchestrate. he started out lost in his youth, but lively at the start of his teaching and manhattan project, but goes to a dark place after failing to justify his achievement wit the bomb, the nazi threat.the acting was superb all around, and while cillian murphy stood out, the rest of the star studded cast performances are noticeable. all the main characters had enough screen time to not be overshadowed. tom conti was a standout as he used his very limited time as albert einstein to great use; i also loved that his and oppenheimer's story arcs had similar endings. robert downey jnr also does a splendid job, his role takes a turn, somewhat shocking as the movie mainly revolves around the manhattan's projects a-bomb creation that we don't get huge insight into his and oppenheimer's relationship, only glimpses that you only put together at the end. casey's affleck's role was so secretive, he didn't have as much of a pivotal role as a i expected. emily blunt and florence pugh were splendid every scene they were in. i couldn't shake that emily blunt's role reminded me of her in the english though, as they were set in similar surroundings. matt damon was also good here. cillian murphy has had spectacular roles in the past, most notably as thomas shelby of which i didn't think he could outdo, but this is probably his career defining performance to date. the cast depth is insane.there are a lot of dark themes explored in depth, so it's a little shocking we don't get to see much of japan, it's almost glossed over once it's done. but that could be due to us watching from oppenheimer's standpoint and how he experienced these events. the countdown was epic and suspenseful even though you know knew it was coming. it might be a story you already know from history but nolan and his cast managed to a create a wonderful character study that submerged you into his story.the music score was great too, helping convey the emotions each scene demanded. i was also surprised by how serene the movie was, while still keeping the thrill of a war drama. how tense and calm the aura of the film was even with a bomb going off.in the end i think it's a perfect biopic, a cinematic masterpiece were we got to see all sides of oppenheimer, however conflicting and the cast and nolan did an amazing job depicting his life. it's a perfect movie; the cinematography, the cast, the writing, the score... what else could you ask for.",10
"1171","oppenheimer"," swing and a miss...","jmcd2007",2023-08-05,"nolan did a great job hiding some extended details of this film on the trailers because i did not expect to see some of what i saw during the film itself. the film itself came off as kind of boring. the odd nude scenes and sex scenes also came off as crude and unnecessary. some scenes like what was mentioned repeat or become redundant throughout the film. the film focused too much on oppenheimer's politics and not enough on the man himself. i'm not a fan of any film that makes politics one of the primary themes. i knew that oppenheimer had political leanings, but did not expect nolan to go this deep into that part of his life.footage of the climatic atomic bomb explosion seemed to have been kept to a bare minimum. his wife became a depressed and angry mess of a character as the film progressed. oppenheimer himself exhibited some troubling behavior, as when he was speaking to a crowd, he was imagining a bomb going off as movie goers were greeted with grotesque imagery of people's faces literally being melted off. in summary, this is not a film that i would recommend seeing again.",6

"1176","oppenheimer"," intense, another nolan classic but very different","christopher_reid",2023-07-22,"i don't know where to begin. this movie was just so intense. like every nolan movie, it has completely enveloped my mind. i'm obsessed with it. it's haunting me.in many ways, it's a big departure for nolan. normally his movies have a lot of action, crazy stunts, far out sci-fi plots and most of them are fictional. even memento had more action and violence than this. dunkirk was based on real events in wwii but it barely had any dialogue and was more of an experience, an action/suspense/thriller ride.oppenheimer truly is a biopic, all about a man and his life. it doesn't try so much to give an objective overall assessment. it feels very personal. it captures the intensity of life. when you reflect over your years and realise the big things which stay with you. other movies feel so trivial compared to this.the acting is incredible, one of the most impressive casts of all time, mostly male but that's a reflection of the reality. cillian is great. so many understated and incredibly talented actors seem to come from the uk and ireland. oldman is great as well in his brief role - when i saw him, i thought ""of course, who else could play a role like this and pull it off"". he's so good at accents and embodying people.branagh, blunt, downey jr., the sister from black widow, hartnett, raiden from mortal kombat: annihilation (a personal highlight) - they're all perfectly cast. not to mention perhaps 10 to 15 other great performances from other actors. it makes me so keen to learn more about the real people and get back into physics. i miss my university years. also the aging effects are flawless, for lack of a better word.the music is really effective. i correctly guessed it was ludwig goransson again (tenet), who kind of replaced hans zimmer who was busy doing dune. i really enjoyed it. it felt like an extension of some of those themes. often heavy in intense, but also contemplative and... intellectual i suppose?i'm now intrigued by oppenheimer. by being so specific in the details of his life, the movie becomes universal. we might not achieve the same things, have the same fears or make the same mistakes, but we can relate to his emotions and experiences. it's all analogous. and few movies touch on life like this.the pace is blistering. nolan is great at drawing you in, directing your attention, building to climaxes, using parallel timelines to enhance the meaning and suspense of various events. now the movie is over, i'm left desperate for more. it's 3 hours long, and it certainly felt long, but it was riveting for that length.i personally have mixed feelings about oppenheimer's politics. teachers shouldn't be political in front of students. it's not the right venue. and communism was dangerous, not that different from fascism - just different names for insane, incoherent visions which overrule personal freedom and lead to totalitarianism. but the paranoia surrounding communism and treatment of oppie was probably unwarranted and unhelpful.the bombing of japan was necessary. few alternatives existed at the time. maybe that could have been emphasised more. but this is a movie and its oppie's movie. he seems like he was a very intelligent and caring man. his fears are still relevant today. i think deterrents work and it's good that the us has the most nuclear weapons in the world. but it's still scary. what if such weapons get in the wrong hands? we're in a new world.overall, this movie was highly engaging considering it's 95% talking. it's powerful, memorable and thought-provoking. it doesn't try to go into the scientific details, just what we need to know. it doesn't pander with cliches.it's full of important interactions, just as our lives are. it seems to rush through them. we're left with all these fragments as we try to piece them together. all the standard emotions are there - happiness, sadness, anger, betrayal, redemption, hope, fear, etc.i can't wait to learn more about the real events and watch this again in 6 months or a year. until then, it's making me reflect on my life and, like very few movies (including schindler's list and e. t.), it reminds me of the immense weight of life itself. how profound it is.",10

firstly, yes, i saw it in imax and yes it was worth it literally stripping everything else away. this is a visual masterpiece and the three hour run time left me wanting more. if you're like me, or are even remotely interested in cinematography or effects design, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.the story
i'll admit i fell pray to the same idea as everyone else hoping that there would be more about the bomb and less about the personal life of oppenheimer but the movie is titled oppenheimer for a reason i was not disappointed by this but any history nerd would've liked a little more screen time for the bomb. i found the pace very acceptable not too slow, and the cuts between black and white and color, i felt were a good way to represent the timelines and points of view of the characters. some people had an issue with this, but i felt like it tied everything together instead of split things apart.the acting
(having not known oppenheimer personally) like some seem to complain like they did i can't say how accurate cillian's performance was, but for me, it felt spot on. i think he was tailor made for this role.matt damon
it's not that he did a bad job. i just feel like there could've been a lot of better options to play general leslie groves. i was a little distracted from his character because it felt like he was trying to be something that wasn't leslie groves. i know it's a movie and historical accuracy can only go so far in hollywood but i just kept asking myself why matt damon?all in all

"1184","oppenheimer"," intelligent dialogue, intricate flashes forward/back. downside: overlong on explosions and imagined atom interaction","adrianovasconcelos",2023-07-22,"director christopher nolan has to be praised for coming up with another very good film, after the dark knight rises, tenet and others. he connects technology with the human mind more successfully than any other director i can think of these days.that said, oppenheimer suffers from the same overlength problem that had already hurt inception: mr. nolan seems to like 3-hour long movies.cinematography by hoyte van hoytema rates extremely high order, the same going for art direction and editing.acting also deserves praise across the board, even if i felt that matthew modine, anton kushner and a few other well known actors had to accept largely insignificant, tiny roles just to be part of a prestigious production.the male lead, cillian murphy, will probably get best actor awards next year. he plays the hamlet-like figure of j. (a letter that stands for nothing, he admits) robert oppenheimer, a physicist/scientist who goes to england, germany, austria and other places where wwii would rage soon after, and he sees several women with different kinds of affection and a general distance that he also keeps in relation to communism and politics, prompted to a large extent by his consuming interest in quantum mechanics, and later in the los alamos project, the h and atomic bombs, and above all the human resourcing around the entire project.murphy looks much older than he does in real life, mirroring the sucked in facial structure of the real oppenheimer, almost like the face of death. he is on screen most of the time and delivers a top notch performance that reflects his jewish background and how he senses the danger of hitler's rise to power and nazi domination. he brims with intelligence, a scientist's mental abstraction, a remoteness reflected in his relationship with his children (never on his mind, he even asks chevalier, who he is cuckolding with the lovely britt kyle, to keep his oldest child for a while), and the difficulty of steering the course at the helm of a project buffeted by so many contrasting and shifting interests, right up to president truman's, and including the ignominiously vindictive lewis strauss, superbly played by robert downey, who also looks much older than in real life, and who came to be viewed as the villain in the aec proceedings that saw oppenheimer lose his security clearance.emily blunt shines as oppenheimer's ignored, betrayed wife, who has to look after the children and do house chores while hubby engages in his scientific quests. she encourages him to continue his work even when he feels dejected by the politics surrounding his overwhelming assignment, and urges him to fight to clear his name instead of adopting the hamletian posture that he seems unable to drop. in the end, she symbolizes the defender and guarantor of the values in the constitution, even if they get trampled by the military wanting a bomb at all costs and quickly to end the war with japan, presidential design, and all manner of envy that is typical of such high-powered jobs and duties.i would have liked the film to explain more clearly the importance of dropping the bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki to beat russian plans to take japan, besides the obvious desire to reduce human casualties caused by war, even if at the cost of millions of japanese lives, and for several generations.oppenheimer offers some insight into pre-, war, and postwar times though, inevitably, history and the actual truth may not have survived unscathed.to conclude, i liked it very much, found it gripping throughout. 8/10.",8

"1193","oppenheimer"," too many long stretches with no stakes","ojford",2023-08-19,"the reason this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece is because 3-hour biopics are rarely successful at the box office - after years of superhero dominance, critics understandably want to promote something different.unfortunately the film itself is disappointing. there are too many long stretches spent in committee rooms discussing things, the significance of which is never explained. it's never clear why it matters if oppenheimer's clearance is revoked. it's never clear how the senate denying strauss a cabinet position makes any difference. nolan tries to make us care with loud dramatic music, but that's no substitute for a compelling narrative.the forward story, chronicling oppenheimer's rise from clumsy physics student to leader of the manhattan project and father of the atom bomb, is better. it's told as an extended movie trailer, in a series of vignettes which fits its portrayal of a brilliant polymath who thinks at the speed of light.however, even this section doesn't quite give us a good understanding of the man. he's first presented as an absent-minded professor, who relies on theory over practice. then, when he's asked to lead the project, he's suddenly thinking about building a city in the desert, concerned about the living quarters for the scientists' families. we don't get a definite personality, just a brief overview of his achievements and personal relationships, told out of order.it's not a bad film. it has some stunning sequences and many of the best actors working today. but compared to say dr strangelove, it's less effective in warning of the dangers of nuclear war. and compared to say a beautiful mind, it's shallower in presenting a brilliant scientist.",5
"1194","oppenheimer"," a great film","dmasursky",2023-09-05,"i had originally thought this was a flawless film but upon reflection, i changed my mind. it is a magnificient film, with a splendid cast. it makes the science interesting and understandable (which could not have been easy) and it doesn't avoid the provocative politics of the situation. my complaint is that the audience does not necessarily understand why oppenheimer is so arrogant and so celebrated. the film opens by showing how insecure and troubled he was, and then jumps ahead to the manhattan project without showing how he came to be so admired and so impressed with himself. it also shows many contenious relationships he had, leaving one to wonder why the project scientists supported him decades later despite their dismay over the use of the bombs. i would have liked just a bit more showing his intellectual growth in his earlier years as well as his management of the project.

"1198","oppenheimer"," oppenheimer is a uniquely intriguing and infinitely compelling cinematic experience.","ed-from-hi",2023-07-22,"'oppenheimer' is a uniquely intriguing cinematic experience. it feels strangely-miraculous the way christopher nolan was able to take-on such complicated and even controversial subject matter and transform it into an intensely absorbing narrative intricately spiced with spectacularly imaginative visuals. based on the over 700 page award winning biography 'american prometheus' by kai bird and martin j. sherwin (which i have read multiple times-over, since it's 2005 publication). the story of how j. robert oppenheimer led the manhattan project to create the first atomic bombs (before the axis powers could ever figure it out), later valiantly attempting to limit the probabilities of world-wide earth-shattering nuclear holocaust.... eventually having his intimate family-life and professional reputation severely disrupted and indelibly injured by the torrent of irrational mccarthyist paranoia sweeping the early 1950's - makes for fascinating material indeed but also an extremely daunting endeavor to capture coherently & compellingly on film due to the sheer complexity of subject matter along with the perplexingly enigmatic nature of the man along with the cruelly-chaotic circumstances of his times. it most definitely feels like only a top-tier exceedingly gifted writer/director like christopher nolan possessed the artistic vision and innovative resourcefulness to truly bring 'oppenheimer' to cinematic 'life' (another critical-factor being christopher nolan's inspired choices for matching the very finest actors to their 'perfect' spot-on roles).cillian murphy especially projects the otherworldly-luminous intelligence of oppenheimer and perhaps even more importantly transmits the disquieting feeling that 'oppie' actually possessed the uncanny awareness (which eventually became disillusioning burden) that he was carrying the weight of the entire world on his shoulders trying to control unremitting nuclear proliferation - not always knowing how to effectively navigate the dark-matter realm of political persuasion. the key to cillian's emotionally resonant performance is that he evokes tremendous poignancy, communicating agonizing internal-conflict and deep reflection even in the many moments when there is little to no dialog (often thru facial expression alone). robert downey jr. provides a masterclass thru his complex portrayal of oppenheimer chief adversary lewis strauss - making strauss a character harboring layers of resentment well-concealed, and it takes practically the entire movie before the audience becomes fully-aware of the manipulative nature of struss's master-plan to bring oppenheimer down a few notches.... things ironically come full circle for strauss which brings a small bit of 'closure' towards finale but downey jr.'s performance is so subtle and multi-layered making the strauss character always fascinating and extremely watchable every time he appears on screen.emily blunt is also extremely watchable as kitty oppenheimer, j. robert's formerly 'radical' wife who was a tragic and tormented (and often alcoholic) figure in real life..... but emily blunt's portrayal goes a long-way toward 'humanizing' kitty often showing how fiercely protective she was of j. robert when the walls were closing in on him. i actually wish there were many more scenes with kitty because it feels like she often gets 'short-shrift' in the many oppenheimer biographies i have read, but emily blunt's intriguing and humane performance seems to shed new light on the authentic character of kitty which is refreshing.matt damon is sufficiently 'commanding' as general leslie groves, the scenes between groves and oppenheimer are some of the best in the entire film. the real general groves was quite a visionary (and somewhat of an authentic genius himself) for choosing oppenheimer to lead the manhattan project in the first place (groves intuitively understood that only oppenheimer could effectively cultivate maximum cooperation & optimal creativity from all the eccentric scientific prodigies involved) groves also fiercely stood by oppenheimer thru the entire wwii years and it was really the groves/oppenheimer professional partnership that guaranteed america would be the first to unlock and unleash atomic power - matt damon and cillian murphy authentically transmit this pragmatic professional bond perfectly!another standout performance is florence pugh as un-reformed radical jean tatlock who might have been oppenheimer's truest love but was also an extremely emotionally-fragile soul who inadvertently brought indelible torment to j. robert's life (and his relationship with jean was probably one of the critical detrimental factors in the loss of security-clearance due to jean's lingering radical history and oppenheimer's lingering love for her). finally benny safdie's portrayal of erratically-brilliant but self-serving edward teller (one of hungary's ultra-brilliant 'martians of science' along with top martian jon von neumann of course) as another essential antagonist (alongside strauss) although teller's redeeming quality was that he was a certified 'genius' in terms of innovative scientific creativity, but he also played a crucial role in adding the final nail to oppenheimer's 'loss of clearance' coffin, but it definitely feels like oppenheimer and teller did (at least in the beginning) harbor a mutual respect for each other's scientific 'gifts' which is exhibited on-screen so safdie/teller's film presence is always compelling.overall, i agree that christopher nolan's 'oppenheimer' is a major cinematic achievement that ensures him a place in the top-tier of all-time finest movie director's (alongside kubrick et al) not only from a creatively artistic standpoint but from his sheer force-of-will and persistence to even get an immensely challenging project like 'oppenheimer' financed, off the ground and on to those imax 65mm screens for all movie fans (and other imaginative dreamers) to see!",10

"1210","wonka"," a whimsical, fun film that captures the spirit of roald dahl and is sure to entertain the younger crowd","mrdhwong",2023-12-14,"""wonka"" is a musical fantasy film that serves as an origin story of the character of willy wonka from the novel ""charlie and the chocolate factory"" by roald dahl. directed by paul king (""paddington"" 1 and 2) and starring timoth√©e chalamet in the lead role, it is a whimsical, fun film that captures the spirit of roald dahl and is sure to entertain the younger crowd.in an unnamed european town, inventor and magician willy wonka (timoth√©e chalamet) arrives to fulfil his childhood dream of running his own chocolate shop. searching for a place to stay, wonka stumbles upon a laundromat run by the suspicious mrs. scrubbit (olivia colman), who offers him a room so long as he signs a contract. after failing to read the fine print, wonka finds himself in debt to mrs. scrubbit and is forced to work around the clock to earn his freedom. while labouring away, wonka meets five other people who are also indebted to mrs. scrubbit's contract; young orphan noodle (calah lane), plumber piper (natasha rothwell), accountant abacus (jim carter), phone operator lottie (rakhee thakrar), and comedian larry (rich fulcher). the five prisoners inform wonka that the city is controlled by the ""chocolate cartel"", a trio of greedy chocolate makers - mr. slugworth (paterson joseph), mr. prodnose (matt lucas), and mr. fickelgruber (mathew boynton) - who are fiercely determined to eliminate any potential competition. wonka teams up with his five new friends to hatch a scheme to bring down the cartel and make his chocolate available to everyone no matter their financial situation.one of the most popular children's stories of the twentieth century is roald dahl's ""charlie and the chocolate factory"", the timeless tale of a young boy named charlie bucket who is given the opportunity to meet the eccentric chocolatier willy wonka and visit his mysterious chocolate factory. since it was first published back in 1964, the story has become a favourite among children the world over, with many like myself growing up reading it at school. further cementing the story's popularity was the 1971 film adaptation ""willy wonka and the chocolate factory"" and to a lesser extent tim burton's 2005 film ""charlie and the chocolate factory"". regardless of which of the two films you prefer, their success at the box office proves that the story is as renowned as it ever was, with the character of willy wonka attracting the most attention due to his quirky personality. the 2023 film ""wonka"" gives us an origin story of the title character in a movie that should keep both children and adults entertained for most of the time.although i'm not entirely sure if we needed to know about the origins of willy wonka, this film shows just barely enough about him to still retain that necessary air of mystery without completely ruining his character. when we first meet the young wonka, he is shown to be ambitious about opening a chocolate shop, singing his passion for the sweet treat loudly from high atop a ship's mast. upon arriving at his destination, wonka learns to his dismay that this place is dreary, depressing, and has little time for fun-loving individuals like himself. in fact, no less than three minutes later, wonka is even forced to pay a fine for daydreaming out in public. things take a turn for the worst when wonka is essentially forced into slavery to pay off a huge debt due to his inability to read a contract's fine print as a result of his illiteracy.in spite of all his hardships, wonka's spirit remains untarnished as he is determined to share his wondrous treats with the world, no matter who or what stands in his way. what i enjoyed here was how the film was able to balance wonka's confident oddball personality with that of him being the underdog in a new town, staying true to himself but still acknowledging the uphill battle he has to succeed in this harsh world. this is an important message that people of all ages can learn from, since becoming successful is not always an easy task and doing so without sacrificing your own integrity is a challenge within itself. as a result, the otherwise off-putting willy wonka becomes a relatable character the audience can find themselves identifying with.being a musical, there are numerous moments in the film where characters break into song whenever it is necessary for them to communicate their inner monologues. while the songs were all fine and served their intended purpose, i found that most of them weren't all that memorable. the one original musical number i liked the most was near the beginning, where wonka learns about the fates of his five co-workers/prisoners and how they are doomed to ""scrub scrub"" until all their debts are paid. the reason i enjoyed this the most was because it is done in the most roald dahl way possible, complete with word play, dark humour, and crackpot villains.additionally, there are also some variations on the classic tunes from the 1971 film. for instance, the ""oompa loompa"" song makes not one but two appearances here, sung by an oompa loompa named lofty (hugh grant). instead of singing about misbehaving children, lofty sings about why he is no longer welcome among his peers, which is both sad and funny once you learn the actual reason. the older viewers might appreciate the callbacks to the original ""willy wonka and the chocolate factory"" film and i'm certain the younger viewers will like the newer songs, but i can't really see any of them getting stuck in people's heads once the movie has finished.as the title character, i liked the youthful spin timoth√©e chalamet was able to add to an already exceptionally outlandish individual. his take on willy wonka is that of an experienced young man who seems ready to take on the world, only to find that not everyone is there to support him in his endeavours. chalamet's wonka seems to be unique among his predecessors in that he does not seem to be the younger version of either one, although he does show some of the condescending traits of gene wilder's version and the melancholic insecurities of johnny depp's version. this almost seems like a compromise of sorts, as though the filmmakers tried to combine both wilder's and depp's wonkas into one so as not to alienate the fans too much. i would say this does work for the most part, however, i personally think they should have just picked one and gone with that instead.most of the supporting cast were quite good, especially wonka's five co-workers turned friends who assist him on his mission. with that in mind, noodle is clearly the main one out of the five that receives the most attention in the story. although i did like the idea of her being wonka's street smart friend, i think there was one important thing about her character that is never explained. early in the film, we learn that wonka is illiterate, struggling to comprehend even single letters of the alphabet, which is where noodle comes in to teach him how to read. being an orphan who never went to school, how did noodle become intelligent enough to be able to educate a grown man on the basics of reading and writing? we never find out how she acquired this level of education, so this seems like a major plot hole the movie glosses over. i'm not sure if this is the film's way of saying children are sometimes smarter than adults, but it would have been nice to have been provided some explanation as to how an orphan raised on the streets is capable of teaching an adult man comprehensive english skills.i thought the three main villains were rather amusing at times, but mr. slugworth is clearly the leader of the trio. slugworth is shown to be the brains of this whole operation, which is established by the firm, aggressive handshake he gives to everyone he meets. this film treats him and his two colleagues as though they are running some kind of narcotics ring, only with chocolate instead of drugs. i suppose this would make slugworth the gus fring of chocolatiering, which is made evident by his widespread infamy over the entire town. on that note, i just wish we could have seen more of mr. prodnose's and mr. fickelgruber's intimidating influence throughout the story. it just seems like all of matt lucas's and mathew baynton's comedic talents are going to waste here, as their characters serve little purpose other than to agree with everything slugworth says.though far from essential viewing, ""wonka"" still serves its purpose as an enjoyable origin story of the most famous fictional chocolate maker in all of children's literature. it may not instil the same level of wonder as the other two feature films before it, but it provides just enough entertainment for a casual viewing with the whole family. had the film placed more focus on

""wonka"" is a two-hour musical comedy directed by paul king, inspired by roald dahl's wonka books but not strictly following them. the film aims to amuse, delight, and inspire cheers when the bad guys are defeated. the performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are likely better than needed to make it a hit, as it is considered a pre-sold property, as many people know and love willy wonka. wonka and noodle, two orphans, are sympathetic to wonka's situation. wonka carries a chocolate bar created by his mom, a candy-maker, for inspiration. the main bad guys are a trio of powerful businessmen who control candy manufacturing and distribution, keep the city's corrupt police force under their control, and have passed laws making it difficult for anyone else to break into the business. the film features sally hawkins as mama wonka, who becomes a good luck charm for big-budget fantasies. ""wonka"" is a captivating and enthusiastic film, with a withholding quality from the character of wonka, who can be likened to gene wilder's long-lost grandchild in moments of quiet contemplation and madcap inspiration. the film's effectiveness makes it a cynical enterprise. wonka, portrayed by chalamet, is an innocent and earnest character with a distinctly british sensibility. unlike depp's and wilder's portrayals, chalamet lacks guile and is guarded in an unnamed european city. the humor is set against a visually dense technicolor world, with costumes and sets beautifully made. willy chalamet's performance in ""wonka"" is a captivating portrayal of a boyish sweetness with a hint of sadness, expressing his love for chocolate-making. he is portrayed as a wholesome character, resembling p. t. barnum played by daniel day-lewis' son, chalamet. chalamet's heartfelt baritone singing is a testament to his character's wholesome nature. the film's lines, such as ""put your hand inside your pock-elet, get yourself some wonka chocolate!"", are a testament to the character's belief in the power of chocolate and its ability to elevate one's mood and life. chalamet's performance is a testament to the power of chocolate and its ability to change lives. the film overrelies on computer-generated effects and stunts, including a miniaturized performance by hugh grant as the oompa-loompa lofty. despite skepticism, chalamet gives himself fully to the wonderment and vocal demands of the role. the film is a playful, heart-tugging take on a beloved character that is smarter than it lets on. the film's beautiful costumes and sets make it outstanding to watch. ""wonka"" is a musical prequel to the roald dahl tale, featuring timoth√©e chalamet as the title character. willy, a 25-year-old chocolate lover, arrives in london after seven years of sailing around the globe. he has recipes for his candy, such as hoverchoc, an egg of chocolate with a bug inside that causes levitate. chalamet's character is characterized by a long purple coat, vest, ascot, and rumpled top hat. willy's dream is to bring the wonder of his candy to everyone in the world, bringing his passion for chocolate to life.",10

movie review -wonka review: so you must have read roal dahl's ""charlie and the chocolate factory"" (1964); you must have seen gene wilder's blockbuster ""willy wonka & the chocolate factory"" (1971) and then tom burton-johnny depp's mega hit ""charlie and the chocolate factory"" (2005), so now it's time for timoth√©e chalamet's origin story of willy wonka with ""wonka"" (2023). it's been almost seven decades, and the tale hasn't lost a bit of its magic. it's so enchanting, joyful, and colourful that all you need to do is handle it with your good skills. that's it. you have success in your hands because the source material is just too good. comedy lover paul king gets it right. paul understood the assignment well. wonka is an exhilarant, amusing, extremely engaging, musically vibrant, and full of chocolate entertainer that stays true to its origin and gives it a nice modern touch as well.wonka is like a prequel to what you have seen in wilder and depp's movies. there you have a chocolate factory, and here the story takes you to the backstory before the factory was built. willy wonka (timoth√©e chalamet) is a youngster with the talent to make incredible chocolates. he isn't settled yet, though. rather, he hasn't started his career. he keeps wandering the streets and halls and showcasing his talent for making chocolate that can instantly win people's tongues and stomachs. since he is selling chocolates at cheap rates that even ""poor"" people can afford, the competitors sense the danger. they try their best to keep him out of the business in whatever way possible, and most of the time they succeed. amidst his ambition of becoming a great chocolate maker, wonka is scammed by a small hotel owner and is made her servant for years to come. with the help of noodle/nicole (calah lane) and other imprisoners, wonka must find a way out and also set his business against the corrupt chocolate businessmen.first of all, paul king has written a king-size entertainer for all age groups. the humour is organic, the gags are real, and the magical touch of wonka's fantasy world makes this one very interesting and engaging. the musical numbers are also well written, as the lyrics have meaning to keep the mood going. wonka's origin story is not old or outdated; rather, it's completely unknown for many, and that's why there are so many pleasant surprises in the movie. in the end, we see wonka building the factory, which we all know, and you can connect dots very well there. we are short on good musical comedies nowadays, and thanks to paul king for writing one that lives up to expectations. we had children, young males and females, and adults in our special show, and the comical segment had us all in splits at the time. i think that's just dandy. i was craving; i was drooling for chocolates by the end, and i wish i could enter the screen just like mia farrow did it in woody allen's ""the purple rose of cairo"" (1985) and devour the mashmello and all the flavours. it's so freaking tasty.timoth√©e chalamet is fantastic as wonka. i wouldn't dare compare this young lad with legends like johnny depp and gene wilder, but yes, he is our willy wonka, alright. if those generations remember wilder and depp at that time, then let this social media generation remember chalamet. calah lane is a sweet child with some adorable scenes, and she looks so cute in all of them. paterson joseph is not the deadly, cruel, but funnily cruel villain here that one would expect in a chocolate-comedy flick like this. there is something about his character that we miss in so many other musical comedies. matt lucas and matthew baynton (that yuk ""poor"" joke was so rich) support him well. keegan-michael key's transformation had the audience on a roll by the end. our favourite mr. bean, rowan atkinson, is a desperate chocoholic, but who must have thought about giving his character the reference of a priest? i mean, it's so hilarious to know. the first frame of his had the audience hooting, and we all really wanted him to have more screen space. jim carter, tom davis, olivia colman, hugh grant, sally hawkins, natasha rothwell, rakhee thakrar, rich fulcher, and others were fine in their supporting roles.joby talbot's songs have made wonka extra delicious, and one can even go on tapping their feet in the cinema hall without even realising when that process begins, automatically. i was tapping my feet, and i didn't even realise it. mark everson's editing has literally no flaws. the only scene that looked slow and dated was when noodle finds her mother, and then you have to think again to know how important that scene was for the film. chung-hoon chung's camera gives you some yummy frames of chocolate and whatnot. roald dahl's classic character needed a modern restoration on celluloid, and paul king has given us that. action, music, comedy, a little bit of a thrill, and an overflow of chocolates-that's what paul serves you on the table in no time. scrumptious is the word! ""you've never tasted chocolate like this,"" says wonka in one of the songs, and i can assure you that he really meant it. this chocoholic musical melody deserves to be swallowed with tasty rashes on your tongue. there is no need to go to any chocolate shop; just visit the nearest cinema hall.rating - 6/10*",6

'oompah loompah doompety do' won't get out of your head besides the fancy choreographies, every detail and nuance conveys a christmas ambience. you can even taste the chocolate, slip with the iced flor covered in snow, smell the chestnuts, notice the smoke from the chimneys...

"1261","wonka"," poor choice in new talent ruins prequel attempt","farthingtonwisemore",2024-01-02,"unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. it has such incredible potential. the imagined prequel is consistent with ronald dahl's charm and wit. timothee chalamet's performance was sensational. the supporting cast including keegan michael keye, patterson joseph, hugh grant, olivia coleman and jim carter were all at their best.the film falls short with the casting director's (nina gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named calah lane who stars in the movie opposite timothy chalamet as the character known as noodle. the character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to dahls original masterpiece. lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. the writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the noodle character at all. this becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. the film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.one has to blame the casting director nina gold first. nina gold's work on projects like bad sisters, game of thrones and the crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. i would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on director paul king's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor calah lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to roald dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.",1

(my answer:in the sequel he is) 2) willy wonka is way too trusting in this. (my answer: yes and that's an actual plot point in this movie and it's worth noting that in the chocolate factory story, willy wonka's secrets were stolen from his factory by corporate spies already meaning that if the movie ends with him opening the factory then he shouldn't be that cynical yet.) 3) but this movie doesn't work with the chocolate factory lore. (my answer to that; it does if you read it as a prequel to the 1971 movie specifically and this film gives more than enough reason to believe that that's meant to be the case.)so in conclusion, i loved it.",9

my score 6/10i don't mind sequels and prequels if they achieve something original or unique but i felt that roald dahl would have been totally unimpressed with this cliche overload musical confectionery.i'm a lover of musicals and great children's stories but not this movie in fact as much as i enjoyed timoth√©e chalamet's characterisation of young willy wonker pre his chocolate factory i was bored .even though at times some of the musical numbers are spectacular i kept thinking this is just another attempt to make a cash cow out of an iconic character .i kept thinking i've seen this character before they are just borrowing from old musicals like oliver or annie .the plot is very different to roald dahl's backstory to willy wonker who he wrote was the son of his hometown's local dentist, dr. wilbur wonka. this unfortunately made willy not allowed to eat chocolate and sweets, and he eventually ran away from home, later starting up his chocolate business from a single shop to a gigantic factory.in this wonker movie willy is an aspiring magician, inventor and chocolatier who arrives by boat to an unnamed european city to fulfil his dream of opening his chocolate shop at the galeries gourmet. he decides to stay at a laundromat after he becomes penniless where he meets the devious mrs. scrubbit and her henchman bleacher who run a sweatshop laundry exploiting their workers.the three other villains are three chocolatiers named mr. slugworth, mr. prodnose and mr. fickelgruber who mock wonka's chocolates .they scheme together and call the corrupt chief of police to confiscate willy's earnings for the day and continue to thwart his ambitions which if realised would ruin theirs.wonka is another huge budget movie estimated at $125 million which may or may not succeed i hope it does but it didn't with me and i really wonder what audience demographic this movie is aimed at ?i doubt it would entertain or hold the interest of children under 13 and i also doubt anyone over that age would get much entertainment out of it other than some good performances and a star studded cast.i enjoyed the 2 paddington movies that simon farnaby and paul king who also is the director of wonker made but i feel have missed the mark in this movie .to many new characters come flying in and out in all directions but don't seem to add much to the story . perhaps it just that roald dahl had said it all in 1964 in his novel charlie and the chocolate factory?charlie and the chocolate factory which has already been adapted as a stage musical book by david greig, music by marc shaiman and lyrics by mark shaiman and scott wittman.joby talbot the composer of wonka has written a few good songs for the movie but nothing that i'd say would be remembered certainly no where near quality of the leslie bricusse and anthony newley score for willy wonka & the chocolate factory which produced the candy man and pure imagination which is also used in the finale of wonker.the ensemble cast is impressive and full of big names like olivia colman as mrs scrubbit , matt lucas as prodnose , hugh grant as oopa loompa guard 1, sally hawkins as willy
wonka's mum ,rowan atkinson as father julius and jim carter as abscus crunch.they are all fun to watch for a while but i found the overall experience of wonka irritating.unlike the superb 2018 sequel to mary poppins mary poppins returns wonka for me added nothing to the wonderful willy wonka & the chocolate factory movie of 1971 starring gene wilder .however i will say top marks to timoth√©e chalamet who impresses me more and more in his movie career. he is worth seeing in this movie as he sings and dances giving an elfish charm to his character in what for me is a lacklustre movie.this chocoholic got saccharine overload in a movie with to many bright wrappers and to many soft centres.",6
"1273","wonka"," weirdos and strangers have the best candy!","coventry",2024-01-09,"before, throughout, and after watching ""wonka"", there was just one question spooking through my head: what would roald dahl think of it? dahl was a genius, and he's in my top three of favorite authors/personal heroes, but he was also known to be a very skeptical and grumpy person when it came to film adaptations of his books. ""willy wonka and the chocolate factory"" (1971) and ""the witches"" (1990) were two successful and widely acclaimed film-versions of children's novels of his, but the author himself hated them. i honestly wonder what dahl would say about a spinoff/prequel of one of the most mysterious characters he invented.we'll never know, sadly, and obviously i never knew him personally, but somehow, i like to believe that roald dahl would have appreciated the colorful and excessively imaginative background story that is given here to his chocolate maker willy wonka! enough about the writer, though, what did i think of it? well, i watched it at the cinema, together with my 8-year-old daughter, and we both loved it. could have done with a little less singing, perhaps, but it's a joyous and stimulating spectacle that is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face from start to finish.if anything, ""wonka"" is loyal to the flamboyant mindset of roald dahl. it's absurd without being ridiculous, it's child-friendly without being childish, it's impossible but simultaneously fascinating, and you'll be getting a couple of unusually wrapped but valuable life-lessons along the way. willy wonka is a naive but very optimistic young man who arrives in a mediterranean city with the dream of opening a candy store. he learns about life the hard way, as bad luck and sabotage pursues him, but willy never loses his optimism and finds good-hearted allies. i really don't want to write too much about the plot, as it's more than worth discovering and experiencing.i had confidence this would be a good film, and this solely based on how the duo paul king and simon farnaby previously handled the adorable ""paddington"" films. they do make use of digital and cgi effects a lot, but it's due to the story being grotesque and fantasy-like. the performances are excellent. i have great admiration for timothy chalamet who doesn't depict willy wonka quite as eccentric as johnny depp or gene wilder did in the past, but nevertheless finds the character's right balance between pleasantly deranged and unworldliness. hugh grant is hilarious, although allegedly he didn't enjoy it much. at the end, all the dots nicely fit into the legacy of roald dahl, and i think that's beautiful.",8

"1279","wonka"," quiet up, and listen down","thevictoriousv",2023-12-18,"roald dahl once wrote that he found gene wilder's performance as wonka in 1971's willy wonka and the chocolate factory to be a way too ""sappy and saccharine"" version of the character he first envisioned. well, if that one was ""a bit too much"", dahl is lucky to have passed away before he could witness the timoth√©e chalamet version.here is a wonka who is full of cheer and whimsy. being that it's a prequel, i guess we are to understand that this is set before he adopted more kooky and sinister traits, ergo this isn't quite the wonka we know. the real issue, perhaps, is the casting. chalamet can be dark and brooding (dune), and a little creepy if he needs to (bones and all), but having him dial up the whimsy feels off.of course, i also believe that there's a missed opportunity here. a while ago, with regards to fxp's the bear, i wrote this: ""when timoth√©e chalamet was cast for the upcoming willy wonka prequel, many tv nerds pointed out that they could've gone with jeremy allen white if they wanted someone who has a sort of chalamet energy to him, but actually looks like a younger gene wilder, supposing that's the wonka they were going for. ... having watched the show that put white on the map, i see it even more. it's like they had some kind of character customization slider with wilder on one end and chalamet on the other and cranked it all the way up to chalamet when they could've left it in the middle and gotten white.""ultimately, however, i warmed up to chalamet as the picture went along. his singing isn't always great, yet there is an earnestness to it all that seems to have won critics over. indeed, as if this year in movies wasn't already wild enough, it now closes out with the revelation that, yeah, even the charlie and the chocolate factory fan-fic prequel is a part of the ""cinema is back"" club. it's good -- for the most part.perhaps we were foolish to presume that a willy wonka musical as done by the man behind paddington -- boasting a cast of such names as sally hawkins, rowan atkinson, and olivia colman -- would be mere soulless ip nostalgia bait, especially in the year when hollywood pictures of that ilk finally would begin to f*ck off. (so starved indeed were people for anything other than the usual slop, with its green-screened everything and persistent key-jangling, that even the return of the saw franchise, itself more ""on fire"" than before, was cause for more jubilation than, say, most of disney's output in 2023.) sure enough, wonka has more lively and well-staged musical numbers than any of disney's recent remakes and is unabashedly colorful to look at.i maintain that some aspects looked unpromising as the trailers came out and that the final product is flawed, but this was still a joyous viewing that certainly left me in the mood for some exotic sweets.one still baffling element is the casting of wonka's first oompa-loompa. instead of a little-person actor, it's hugh grant's head on a small body. i understand if little people would find this sort of role demeaning (or if peter dinklage's comments about the exploitation of little people made studios less willing to cast little-person performers in roles like this, ironically making the landscape more difficult for the group he sought to protect as they now get even less work), but this isn't really a sight one gets used to.lastly, allow me to once more evoke david ehrlich with the following musing: ""there's a delicious irony to the fact that warner bros.' first big release since discovery ceo david zaslav (once again) canned a completed film in exchange for a $30 million tax write-off is an anti-capitalist fable set in a city run by a ruthless chocolate cartel who've diluted their own product in order to hoard the profits."" hollywood will never be perfect, but sometimes, as with the year 2023, it lets out more gold than usual. golden tickets, if you will? no? okay.",6

"1288","wonka"," entertaining enough","nightwishouge",2024-02-10,"based on the previews, i desperately wished to avoid seeing this movie. but my girlfriend's little brother wanted to go, so hey, free popcorn. i was rewarded with a film that is suitably okay and occasionally pretty good.this is the origin story of willy wonka--so beholden to the 1971 version that it reuses its songs, but apparently not intended to be a canonical prequel. this wonka is kind and magnanimous to a fault, a pure being who only wishes to inspire joy and imagination through his magical confections. it's difficult to imagine this character growing into the cynical, eccentric, and occasionally sadistic recluse gene wilder played. wonka's relationship with the oompa loompa (hugh grant in a scene-stealing performance) seems carefully constructed to avoid invoking the residue of enslavement that hangs over the novel and its other adaptations. in a way, creating a backstory for a character like wonka is as foolhardy as trying to set the joker's origins in stone--he just works better when he's nine-tenths mystery--but the filmmakers establish so firmly early on that they're doing their own thing that you never really feel like they're cheapening the classic interpretation of the character by over-explaining him. this is almost more of a parallel universe story, a what-if, a big-budget fan fiction that takes what it wants from the source material and doesn't sweat the rest of it.the acting is variable. i've enjoyed chalamet in everything else i've seen him in, but his performance as wonka is a touch too ""musical theater kid"". i suppose it's good that he's having fun, smiling and dancing with a kind of sexless energy that conveys to the audience, ""i'm not a threat!"" but it doesn't exactly make for a character with depth. given that this is generally meant to be a fairy tale, i suppose it's all right to play a superficial archetype, but there were times when the character felt ""vacuous"" as opposed to ""relentlessly optimistic"". olivia colman and tom davis are a lot of fun as the unscrupulous owners of a sweatshop laundromat--very roald-dahl-esque in their playful grotesqueness. (fan fiction prompt: what if willy wonka met sweeney todd? but keep it pg, please.) calah lane is unfortunately rather flat as noodle, the obligatory sad-eyed orphan. perhaps the writing failed her, perhaps it's that chalamet was only giving her a single note to play against, but i found her lacking in charisma, which makes her character very slight and difficult to really invest in, which in turn hampered the sweetness of the ending. everybody else is suitable to their roles.the biggest problem with wonka is that it never really soars as a musical. the numbers are perhaps entertaining in the moment, but the staging often feels unimaginative and the music is forgettable. the only tunes you'll be humming on the way out of the theater are the standards from the '71 version. it almost feels as though the filmmakers made a straight narrative film and some studio head saw the result and was like, ""no songs? but the audience will expect songs in a wonka movie! quick, go shoot a few."" the third act pretty much eschews musical numbers altogether until the (underwhelming) reprise of ""imagination"". everything feels weightless and inconsequential the moment the characters start belting out a ditty, and the excess of cgi doesn't help. the movie works a lot better as a gentle comedy--pleasantly formulaic, at times emotional, and occasionally even whimsical.wonka is no paddington, but there's enough to put in the plus column that i look forward to director paul king's next endeavor.",6

"1311","wonka"," puzzling but entertaining","sunsphxsuns",2024-01-06,"about halfway into wonka (2023) i began wondering if ""reimagining"" classic films is always a good idea. do we really need another casablanca (1942) or gone with the wind (1939)? does leonardo da vinci's mona lisa (painted between 1503-1509) truly need ""cgi"" and other digital effects to enhance her iconic smile? i don't think so. yet, there seems to be a lack of wonderfully original scripts in hollywood. if that's not true, then why else would film companies continue to tamper with that which has already been wonderfully done? perhaps it is because wonka is a pre-sold property. it already has several generations of fans to bolster the box office receipts. after all, film making may be a fascinating art form, but at the end of the day, it is still a business with a bottom line.to its credit, wonka offers a clever back story of willie's origins. the film also introduces us to several new songs, some of which, are quite memorable, but not nearly as much as the reboot of the wistful tune, ""pure imagination."" one thinks of the late gene wilder even as timoth√©e chalamet performs a very capable version on the screen. chalamet is very charming, of course (he's a tremendous actor), yet the character is not written nearly as cynically as wilder's 1971 portrayal. indeed, even the brooding darkness in tim burton's charlie and the chocolate factory (2005) is absent here. wonka is far more optimistic than its two predecessors, though perhaps that is not a bad thing, especially for younger audiences.for the most part, ""wonka"" is visually entertaining and hits several high marks one would expect for a film that had a $125,000,000 budget. it's an elegant enterprise to be sure, but nevertheless has some very big shoes to fill.no spoilers here as usual, but i can share that timoth√©e chalamet reportedly was constantly sick during production as a result of having to eat an extraordinary amount of chocolate and candy.",8

"1320","wonka"," pretty magical","baileycrawly",2024-01-14,"wonka is an interesting film. as far as origin stories go, they don't exactly set it up for something you would ever think would be successful. and then, with the likes of the handsome (and talented) timothee chalamet in the cast, it's easy to think of this movie as something hastily made simply because the ""willy wonka"" property is still viewed as profitable by the studio.and, while that may be true to an extent, this movie was overall pretty decently made. timothee not only delivers his trademark second-to-none acting chops in front of the camera, but he also adds singing to his repertoire (something i, personally, have never seen him do in a role). he's got a gorgeous singing voice, which serves to make this even better.there are lots of little homages to gene wilder and the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory film as well and, although they often feel like yet another soulless act of fan service (isn't that everywhere these days?), it still holds up pretty well on its own.the music is fun and catchy, the characters are easily sympathizable and relatable, and the story flows well enough to keep me fully interested throughout the duration of the film. where it starts to fall apart, however, is in the lore... particulalry surrounding the oompa loompas and how they came to work for wonka.look, i can fogive hugh grant in part for doing a relatively terrible job in the role (he was focused primarily on the payday of it all and, at this point, who can really blame him?), but what's a little bit harder to forgive is that, given that this film is billed as the origin of willy wonka, the inconsistencies of where, exactly, the oompa loompa characters came from and how wonka ended up being tied to them is completely inaccurate and muddled to the story present in the book as well as both film versions (although more extensively in tim burton's rendition of the tale).overall, if you can suspend your disbelief and forget (to a certain degree) about the finer details of the original story, this is a fun little piece of moviemaking magic that isn't afraid to have a good time. and you should, too, if you relax and enjoy it.i want to close by giving quick props to the satirical elements tackling the government, coroprations and their shady behaviours. sure, it was played up for laughs but i can't help but feel the industry is taking a few (light-hearted?) jabs at themselves with the story behind this film.",8

"1331","wonka"," a simply delightful and magical film to bring you cheer!","meydiana-65242",2024-01-29,"wonka is the spiritual prequel to the 1971 masterpiece and family-classic willy wonka and the chocolate factory. this film is hyper focused on the backstory behind the wacky, eager and joyous chocolatier as he returns from a seven-year excursion and attempts to make his way in the world as the most renowned chocolate maker. throughout the film, wonka is faced with the success and failure of a candy-maker, while meeting a group of captive workers in a launderette, most notably a young girl named noodle, who follow him on his journey to attaining his dream and facing the chocolate cartel trio consisting of slugworth, two other well-known chocolate makers, as well as the police force. it is, in essence, the companion to the 1971 film and illuminates the humble beginnings of the titular character in a way we never thought we would see. timoth√©e chalamet's performance as willy wonka is brilliant. timoth√©e, throughout the film, is able to capture that aurora we all felt watching gene wilder play the quirky and fun candy maker. his mannerisms, temperament, humor, wittiness, and enthusiasm is unmatched, cementing himself as the willy wonka we know and love in gene wilder. as first, many seemed skeptical of how well he would perform, but undoubtedly, timoth√©e chalament is simply wonderful. another charming performance is that of calah lane as noodle, the orphan worker wonka meets in the film. her companionship matched with chalamet's well-natured character, displays such emotion and hope. lane's character is confused and silenced initially, but through wonka, she finds herself and then builds the confidence to become wholesome while tagging along with him. the last performance that was quite impressive and exciting was hugh grant as lofty, a cunning, ill-humored, and persistently annoying oompa loompa bent on making wonka pay for his crime of stealing from loompaland. hugh grant is hysterical, even though his appearance in the film is short of just half an hour in segmentation. though his screen time was limited, hugh grant's performance as an oompa loompa is both comical and entertaining. he really does capture the disposition of the oompa loompa's from the 1971 film and even sings in the original riddle-like voice and rhythm from the 1971 film too! the additional and supporting cast are exceptional as well. keegan-michael key, rowan atkinson, and company just add that much more laughs and interest to the film. the music accompanying the film is beautiful. just like the original film, the score and compositions add such wonder to this story and even contain subtle clues of songs you may have heard in the mel stuart film! such light-heartedness and beauty give the music such importance and depth, truly encapsulating the movement and tone of the film. the cgi, practical effects, scenery, and more were outstanding as well. everything was on the dot and seemed real to the point that it will leave you feeling that making chocolate that can make you fly or coming across little orange men with green hair can actually exist! overall, wonka is the perfect film, not only because of its simplicity, but how it is representative of establishing the backstory of both literature and cinema's most iconic character. though gene wilder is sadly no longer with us, he would be proud of timoth√©e's performance and the charm presented by every bit of time and effort put into the making of this film. a must see film is you love willy wonka or if you generally love this type of film!",10

"1353","wonka"," make heyday while the sun shines","njijaaj",2023-12-20,"there's a warm glow to this film. a comfort of joy washes over you as you settle down for this visual treat. it is a borderline musical and it does not take long to establish that musical numbers will come your way.. a lot. they are catchy for sure, but they are unlikely to win any awards. i really did like timoth√©e chalamet in this. i thought it was a great casting choice. i'm sure there was a lot of thought went into choosing him and it paid off. i actually preferred his of all the wonkas gone before. gene wilder and johnny depp were bordering psychotic weirdos, although i'm probably alone in that thought. chalamet takes an easier friendlier approach and makes for his friendships in the film much more believable. i don't think the film would have worked otherwise. you know it's a heyday movie now when there is an olde worlde funfair chucked in (and a giraffe) and the cast from past heyday movies (especially from paddington) make a return for this predominantly british cast. tom davis was the chef t-bone and plays bleacher in this. i actually laughed out very loudly in the cinema when he puts his lederhosen on! overall i loved this movie. my hard to please son who is 10, gave it an 8.9 so i'd trust that more than what i'm writing. overall, lots of fun with a good ending.",10

willy discovered she is the daughter of slugworth's dead brother. noodle's mother left her with slugworth, but he realised she could claim the family fortune when she grows up. slugworth dumped his niece with scrubitt and lied to her mother that she had died. willy and his friends put together a plan to expose the cartel using an accounts book abacus had spotted when he worked for slugworth. releasing the giraffe into the cathedral as a distraction, willy and noodle go beneath ground to find the book but are cornered by the cartel. they are trapped in the container where they are to be drowned in chocolate. before entering, willy asks the cartel to give a jar of hover chocs to the oompa-loompa to repay his debts, but the three men and father julius eat the chocolates, and lofty appears and rescues willy and noodle. confronting the cartel and the chief outside, willy and noodle expose their actions to the police and the public revealing the contents of the account book, and their chocolate is released through a water fountain, ruining their business. the cartel uncontrollably levitates due to the hover chocs, while the chief of police is arrested. the crowd celebrates by tasting the chocolate containing willy's ingredients. willy unwraps his mother's chocolate bar, finding a golden ticket with a last message from his mother telling him that chocolate is best shared. willy shares his mother's chocolate with his friends. willy helps noodle reunite with her birth mother, dorothy smith (tracy ifeachor), who works in the library. willy pays off his debt to lofty, but he says he could do with some help when he opens a new factory, he needs a ""chief taster"". willy purchases an abandoned castle and with lofty helps to build the wonka factory. meanwhile, scrubitt and bleacher are arrested trying to hide evidence of sabotaging wonka's shop, and eating his chocolates, they are turned into the twits. also starring kobna holdbrook-smith as officer affable, simon farnaby (also writing) as zoo security guard basil, charlotte ritchie as barbara, phil wang as colin, ellie white as gwennie (mistress of the keys), sophie winkleman as the countess, murray mcarthur as ship captain, peep show's isy suttie as fruit & veg vendor, colin o'brien as young willy wonka, rufus jones as jenkins, tim fitzhigham as sinister ship captain, susie fairfax as abacus crunch's wife, coronation street's ian bartholomew as sceptical old man, justin edwards as green-skinned customer, miranda's dominic coleman as donovan, and alison pargeter as wendy chucklesworth. chalamet is likeable as the aspiring constantly positive upcoming candy man, colman and davis are a great double act as the mean workhouse owners, joseph, lucas and baynton enjoy themselves as the pantomime villains, young lane gives a confident performance as wonka's assistant, and grant as the pompous wisecracking little creature is hilarious, spotting recognisable acting and comic talents is the cast is fun as well. there are some nice songs written by the divine comedy's neil hannon, including ""a hatful of dreams"", ""you've never had chocolate like this"" and ""a world of your own"", and the return of classic songs ""the oompa-loompa song"" and ""pure imagination"" with slightly altered lyrics is good. as an origins story for the young chocolate factory character it works well, it is full of likeable characters, a charming dickensian atmosphere, with colourful costumes and set pieces, there are some good laughs to be had, the family will all have fun with this little bite of magic, a sweet and enjoyable musical fantasy. very good!",7

"1378","wonka"," a somewhat bland prequel with a sweet edge.","movieman6-413-929510",2023-12-10,"wonka is a prequel to the 1971 film willy wonka & the chocolate factory. this prequel was directed and partly written by paul king, the director of the two paddington films.young willy wonka (timoth√©e chalamet) tries to bring more flavor to the world with his own unique chocolate. when he tries to do this with his own chocolate sales, willy gets into trouble with the chocolate cartel. this cartel is run by slugworth (patterson joseph), who runs the chocolate trade in more corrupt, dishonest ways.together with noodle (calah lane) and the fellow residents of willy's new apartment complex, they secretly try to go against slugworth's chocolate trade, so that people can enjoy different chocolates and other sweets from willy wonka's unique recipes and preparation methods in fairer ways. .
the book adaptation of roald dahl, his book about willy wonka and his chocolate factory, was well received around 1971. they managed to make this film unique, once in the chocolate factory with colorful environments filled with different sweets. what further made this film unique was the acting of gene wilder, who managed to make the role of willy wonka his own with his own creative input.in 2005, the film was remade with johnny depp playing the role of willy wonka. this remake was directed by tim burton, who also gave the film his own twist, which made the film a bit more unusual and dark.now with this prequel to gene wilder's willy wonka, timoth√©e chalamet gets the opportunity to make the role and the origin story a little more personal and develop it further. unfortunately, he continues to play the role a bit safer and within the lines. as a result, the younger version of willy wonka misses his mysterious, special sides. timoth√©e chalamet's singing is good, but seems a bit less pure compared to gene wilder's singing. fortunately, other cast members know how to provide better and more appropriate singing, such as calah lane.in the original film, it takes about the first 45 minutes of the film for willy wonka's character to emerge in the film. in this prequel you get to see this character from the beginning, but after about an hour and fifteen minutes his fledgling chocolate factory really makes an appearance. in the beginning you follow willy wonka more as an illegal street seller of chocolate, while he tries to stay out of the hands of the chocolate cartel. this gives the film a different atmosphere. once you get closer to the chocolate factory, the film may seem a bit more familiar. however, the film does miss some of the unique magical environments that the original film had. in the original film, willy wonka's helpers, the oompa loompas, were played by small actors. in this film, an oompa loompa is played by hugh grant, who is transformed into oompa loompa with special effects. this way, credibility is lost somewhat. sometimes it can also come across as a bit unusual thanks to the visual effects. because more use is made of visual effects, this film may seem less believable compared to the original film.this way, this film can become a new youth film for the modern generation, who can grow up with this film. furthermore, the film may also be entertaining for fans of timoth√©e chalamet.",5
"1379","wonka"," waste of timothee","gamakunn",2023-12-21,"it was very hard to stay awake to watch this. it was even terrifying to see the actors to sing and dance. lol they are probably good actors. the problem is the script. such a waste of timothee. the story wasn't connected to the charlie and the chocolate factory which was very disappointing. chocolates didn't look good at all. wonka looked already rich and successful guy from the beginning which was funny. western people seem to like the first charlie and the chocolate factory, but i like the second one the best. love tim burton's world. if i have to say something good about this movie, it's oompa-loompa's dance, but why did they cast hugh grant for oompa-loompa?",3

2) i thought the songs were very good and the dance choreography that accompanies a lot of them was also very impressive. ""a world of your own"", ""pure imagination"", ""for a moment"" and ""sweet tooth"" were real highlights for me
3) as the title of this review suggests, i found the film to be incredibly heartwarming and endearing. i thought the friendship between wonka and noodle was extremely powerful and in general i just thought the whole film made me feel better about the world and come out of the cinema with a spring in my step
4) casting hugh grant as the oompa loompa was a stroke of genius. he's brilliant and his signature level of wit and sarcasm still shines throughnegatives (all very small and nitpicky):1) chalamet's line delivery at times was too cringey for me; ""land ahoy"" and ""absolutely insane"" are the two examples that immediately spring to mind
2) the character of larry the comedian was so annoying and just felt completely unnecessary
3) there were a couple of times where characters throw and catch things and the cutting / editing of those moments was poor
4) i understand that it's a kid's film, but it always really bothers me in films when villains don't take the easy opportunity to finish off the hero. the chocolate cartel are completely okay with blowing up the boat wonka is on when he tries to leave the city, but they don't shoot him when they're pointing a gun directly at him in their underground lair?? instead they decide to slowly submerge him in chocolate instead for some reason??",9

2. read the books

"1401","wonka"," a sweet and lovable film that captures the imagination and wonder of roald dahl's world and characters, even if the titular wonka is somewhat lacking in his diabolical side","ionicbreezemachine",2023-12-27,"after seven years traveling abroad looking for exotic flavors, aspiring chocolatier willy wonka (timothee chalamet) arrives in europe eager to establish himself. while his chocolates prove immensely popular, a trio of chocolatiers consisting of slugworth (paterson joseph), prodnose (matt lucas), and fickelgruber (mathew baynton) use their connections with the chief of police (keegan-michael key) to force willy away from selling chocolate. with no means of selling his wares, willy winds up in a massive amount of debt at a boarding house run by mrs. scrubitt (olivia colman) and bleacher (tom davis) and forced to work in their laundry to work off his debt. with the help of scrubitt's orphaned ward noodle (calah lane), wonka and his assortment of friends who are also debtors of mrs. scrubitt craft a plan to upend the chocolate cartel.wonka is the third theatrical incarnation of the characters from roald dahl's 1964 children's book charlie and the chocolate factory following the 1971 willy wonka and the chocolate factory and the 2005 charlie and the chocolate factory and the first to not be directly based upon the book. development on a new willy wonka film began in 2016 when warner bros. reacquired the rights to the wonka character from dahl's estate with the intention later revealed to be making the film a prequel to the 1971 film detailing wonka's origins. paul king was selected as director based on the success of his work with the paddington films, and even reteamed with some of his collaborators from paddington 2 on writing the screenplay. critical and audience reception has been very positive with wonka also being credited with revitalizing the movie musical genre which has struggled at the box office since 2020. wonka is a very sweet and agreeable film that tries to do right by the source material, even if it's placement as a prequel is somewhat undercut by its portrayal of the titular wonka.from a purely technical point of view, wonka is a gorgeous looking film. the production is certainly to be commended as the nameless european city in which wonka takes place feels timeless and is rich in details from the busy din of the galleries gourmet to the purposefully unpleasant scrubbit & bleacher that carries more than a few shades of roald dahl's the twits, wonka creates a world that is beautiful and sweet while still possessing a bit of dahl's signature edge and bite. the movie also features a bevy of notable british character actors in major or supporting roles with the likes of rowan atkinson, jim carter, and olivia colman being but a few whose presence adds to the engaging nature of the world created. keegan-michael key is very funny as the corrupt chief of police who does the chocolate cartels bidding, and a running gag about how he's bribed in chocolate is very amusing and very dahl like. but stealing every scene he's in is none other than hugh grant who plays oompa-loompa lofty and his relationship with wonka and how he came to be involved is very amusingly done with a rendition ""oompa loompa"" repurposed from 1971 original.i think this does lead into one of the weak points with the movie which is the soundtrack. while all the music is fine and sounds and looks good in the moment, i think the lack of differentiation among the presentation of the songs prevents any of them from standing out in a big way and it speaks volumes how the songs pure imagination and oompa loompa from the original film are included here and overshadow the new ones. we also have timothee chalamet as willy wonka and while he has a likable and engaging screen presence, i never felt like he was going to become gene wilder's wonka from the 1971 film. while thankfully chalamet's interpretation largely avoids the unnerving vision burton and john august brought to the 2005 character, the paddington influence really shows as chalamet possesses all the whimsy you expect from wonka but without the diabolical edge instead presented as a naive innocent dreamer to a fault. from the fact wonka has a very pronounced motivation of fulfilling ""his mamma's dream"", his overly trusting and generous nature, and the fact he can't read it does feel like they've tried to copy that same paddington feel to wonka which i'm not sure is all that successful. sometimes chalamet is allowed to convey a more diabolical side to his character with his usage of stage magic and illusion to evade the police, but it's often overtaken by the focus on sweetness and innocence that paul king and simon farnaby are more inclined towards.in terms of cinematic depictions of willy wonka, wonka is a marked improvement from the 2005 film while not reaching the level of the 1971 original. while the film's production, atmosphere, and supporting performances are incredibly well done, the music is pleasant without standing out and chalamet while likable in the lead role never sold me as an early version of gene wilder's take on the character. a pleasant enough experience especially if you enjoyed the paddington films, but i don't expect to revisit wonka in the same way i revisit willy wonka and the chocolate factory.",7

"1412","wonka"," whimsy delightful, and family focus","rgkarim",2023-12-16,"likes:the setting
-we're back in the origins of the inventor, which means stepping back in time, and king's direction has executed tis well.-glorious european design by trade brings an old timey delight that wonka held long ago. streets abuzz with society in these gorgeous streets of cramped alleys, large squares, and buildings that hold so much charm.-it provides that classic 1971 feel, but holds the tim burton charms and presentation at points to blend the world into a playground best for sharing candy treats.-as the movie progresses, the imagination comes to life to continue to give dahl's extreme fantasy setting life, helping fill in with color, to what started as a very greyish world.the costumes
-adding even more personality are the various costumes that come into the works.-certainly no marvel or star wars, wonka's elements again go back to tradition and matching the very evolution and practicality of fashion, as seen in various piece films.-the suits are straight and stiff, the dresses are flowing and conservative, but hold status, and the ""riff-raff"" have more character than the elite, that only continues to grow with each sale of chocolate.-and wonka himself may not be the aura of personality like the other movies, but that traditional look is still there, has explanation, and like the others gradually shapes into the beginning of the madness.the acting
-a solid cast to bring the life, king's recruitment of actors and actresses was delightful in bringing a dahl story to life.-i'm going to focus on four in this cast, because the list is first billed, but be assured that king has brought together people to make a cast that fits in the whimsical wonka world.keegan-michael key is a fun twist to his christmas movie on netflix. he's a fun antagonist, gruff, but clumsy, using comedy as his forte to make things fun, and an expression that feels very child and goofy. fantastic line delivery that felt like solid ad-libbing, he netted points for the fun feeling.paterson joseph as slughorn is a fine leader of the cartel. malicious, conniving, greedy, and more fill his delivery with spice, but never quite losing that fairytale restraint for a movie to be too scary or loud in a kid's movie. an excellent blend of malice and silliness i expected.-calah lane a wonderful member who holds the heart and soul of dahl's focus, the child aspect with adult lessons to learn. lane brings a lot to her role as noodle, a fantastic dreamer, but hard knock life delivery that is perfect for this movie. her chemistry with chalamet is spot on and i loved her engagement with the camera.-of course chalamet is the star and once again dips well into a movie with commitment, talent, and accuracy in getting an aspect of wonka. he's charming, goofy, vulnerable, and inspiring all at once, and that hard combination is done well for much off the movie. solid interactions, great physical acting, and that gleam he matches to wilder's look long ago, quite chilling in just how good this guy is.the story/sentimentality
-it's a dahl origin story, and while i don't know how much is from his notes and works, i must say it felt welcoming to the wonka universe.-wonka keeps to the writer's focus on fantasy worlds, good lessons, and the consequences that come from greed, all nicely portrayed in that same coy jab that we've seen.-yet, the movie takes the musical element and starts to expand more on wonka, adding these touching moments that burton did that hold deeper ties and investment that further mold wonka into something more.-and all while keeping it fun for kids, the stories that come together have sentimental value, and keep to elements of fun wonka's world is known to have.the music to a degree
-it's a musical, and you need music. fortunately, wonka has you covered... at least to a degree.-the quality is spot on for a theater visit, great use of instruments, tight control over vocals, and a solid use of technology to get you into the number.-each song does add that dahl story telling twist, one part moral boosting, one part character examining, and plenty of parts aspiration and dreams that wonka always sings for the audience.-there are touching piano solos, blends of splendid instruments blaring, and the numbers themselves have elements that feel like others, helping boost the themes and messages as only movies can.-that's the delight of the wonka music to a reviewer and fan like me.the special effects
-better than the original, technology evolution has done much to help make these worlds come to life.-wonka, to me, feels like a theater show with special effects of the cinema, glorious sets that only computers and a studio can make to help add that immersion factor.-several accidents have much better evolution than 1971, with chocolate, candy, and other delights matching that look of burton's studio.-and to keep the animation looking real with what looks practical and cgi mixed, again a solid entry in my eyes that really just brings dahl's words to life.the comedy
-by far one of my favorite elements is the comedy. a blend of adult and kid humor that never crosses the line to inappropriate.-wonka's stumbling and naivety, the sarcasm of noodle, the idiocy of the constable and the villains... it all works in a nice balanced use to relieve the moments.-the winner is hugh grant, an oompa loompa with attitude, sarcasm, and quite honestly the most traditional wonka charm of the bunch. perhaps an influence to the latter, perhaps not, he was my favorite element in use that blends older humor tastes, with new generation flair.the charming feeling
-what ties it all together is the charm and delight of the wonka-verse in this movie.-paul king has done this tirelessly in his movies, and wonka somehow has that youthful feeling that still speaks to the kid inside of me.-like paddington, this movie just holds so much, speaks so deep, and is just a fun escape that got me back into the movies and away from the internet wars.-that's why this film has the heart and shininess to it, and makes for a good time out with groups at just how much the hope, inspiration, and struggles you can see without getting too lost in ""new directions.""dislikes:the pacing inconsistency
-there are times the movie is slow as molasses, slogging through awkward world building, and the first day struggles on the town.-then there are times where it's like the flash has taken over and achieved the impossible, or maybe shown how far work ethic has fallen.-either way, wonka's issue is time balance, editing that took out a lot and made an inconsistent up and down that could have had better use.-it's not the worst, but, i wonder what potential it had if these elements could have been extended or smoothed out on the story, numbers, and fun.the plot hole issues
-let's get this out, we don't know if this a true prequel or if this is a new start based on the internet, so let's just focus on this movie.-wonka's got great consistency, but again, there are things that don't make sense that i can't say too much to spoil.-let's just say the crafting element seems a bit too fantasy, some of the building opportunities are a bit too fast, and the suspense of disbelief a tad more than what a dahl story had.-i'd have liked to see time balance help iron this out, and perhaps more time to talk, but again, this movie was doing a lotmissing wonka's darker wit
-wonka is coy, sarcastic, and a bit of a darker and sterner side to his comedy. i missed that in this movie.-yet, as this is before the infamous spy ordeal, i get why it might not be there and we only see the dreamer side.-story aside, missing that sarcasm and that comedic spike was something i held, fortunately filled by the oompa loompa that would accompany about a third of the movie.the music on another role
-by far the most disappointing to me, is the splendor of the music and the unique quality
-frozen, greatest showman, la la land, and others are better to me in terms of variety of musical numbers than this film, a shame given the potential of the director and the world.-wonka's music is good quality, but many numbers start out the same, many have the same build up and opening, then kind of get different later in the song.-not that they aren't good, but without the visual elements to help, the songs didn't have quite the portfolio of originality that i had hoped, leaving me disappointed that the musical element sort of flopped outside of the wonka dream tone.the verdict
it may not be a dive into the factory, but wonka turns out to be one of the most fun movies i've seen in a very long time. that whimsical nature and paul king's direction, really blends youth and experience together diving back into the world that grabbed me at five years old. it's a quality world building and special effects use, enough to make the impossible, possible, but never overwhelm it. a family film with so much charm, it really was a fun dive into the origins and escapism that made a theater visit fun with the technology ad songs. such a charming cast and tight direction made this movie worth every penny, and though missing some variety, some of that factory wit, and even a little more of the adult fortitude, wonka accomplished a lot and made the whole experience super fun and engaging to say the least. i find this movie to be quite worth a recommendation, and hope that under king's direction, we get a few more installments into this world of wonka. my scores of this musical melody movie are:adventure/comedy/family: 7.5-8.0
movie overall: 7.0-7.5.",8

"1415","wonka"," i got a cavity","df4205",2024-02-07,"much like the mary poppins follow-up, this prequel to the much loved willy wonka and the chocolate factory falls flat at worst and mediocre at best. while it's not a horrible film, it falls well short of the bar set by the original staring gene wilder. walking in the footsteps of a legendary, beloved classic is a near-impossible task as it is, but this film barely seems to try.the music/songs:the problem with modern day musicals, this one included, is that they're not songs - they're conversations set to a tune. while they sometimes meet the technical requirements of rhyme, getting there is quite ponderous as they fail badly in terms of meter. by the time a character has finished singing one sentence, i could've listened to three songs from the original. this, i think, is why the songs are largely unmemorable because each one requires us to essentially learn ""modern major general.""compared to the original, these songs also seem largely lacking in point. whether, as many others point out, they're far too frequent or some other reason, they just don't inspire a person to sing along. the original songs either gave us insight in to the character's state of mind, they're foibles, or their comeuppance. here, its more like ""ow, i stubbed my toe! it really hurt! i'll be walking funny all day!""the characters:grandpa joe, charlie, veruca, and willy are all timeless, well-known and had time to be explored/fleshed out. heck, even the one-shot people like the scientist with the machine telling him it couldn't cheat and the psychiatrist demanding his patient tell him where a dream told him a ticket was had more personality and are more memorable than most folks we see here. the villains are cartoonish caricatures lifted right out of a neil breen film - twirling their mustaches, talking openly about how evil they are, and doing incomprehensibly stupid things like keeping records of their misdeeds.though timoth√©e chalamet seems a capable actor, the writing for willy wonka doesn't give him much to work with. here, willy is presented as an ever-jolly fellow, constantly smiling and looking on the bright side of life. does that seem even remotely like the enigmatic, wise-cracking, flippant, wise, distant, playful, fun-loving, often enraged and borderline psychotic willy portrayed by gene? the fun of the original willy was that he could be all those things because from the time he 'fell' off his cane and did a roll you learned you could never know what to expect out of him from one moment to the next. this incarnation just doesn't seem the same man who would show such unbridled rage as during his ""you stole fizzy lifting drink,"" speech. yes, people can change, but we should have gotten at least a hint of one of these other moods/behaviors during the movie, just to show him as being capable of capricious behavior.final thoughts:i agree with those that have already said it, it's a nice looking movie. the visuals and effects are excellent, but is that enough to carry a film? the original didn't have things like cgi and even adjusting for inflation, the budget for the original is a penny in the cup compared to this one, yet i can watch the original again and again and again...this movie just isn't going to get the same kind of love and devotion. while the actors do what they can, the movie winds up being too ""sweet"" for it's own good. the original was accessible to both adults and children alike, this one seems to lean heavily towards favoring children. there's nothing wrong with that, per se, but if you want your film to be timeless, you have to make it so adults aren't going to want to pull their hair out or to suddenly remember they need to cook a 2 and a half hour dinner.",4

"1419","wonka"," a wonderful watch","kjproulx",2024-01-26,"it was hard for me to not have some small expectations going into wonka, simply because i am a huge fan of willy wonka and the chocolate factory. that original film from 1971 is a film i grew up watching many, many times. when i was younger i also liked charlie and the chocolate factory, but i have since grown a distaste for it. in my eyes, after that johnny depp version, there was nowhere to go but up. i'm very happy that i got around to checking out wonka though because it was just wonderful to watch. far different from the other versions, here's why i recommend this one.willy wonka, a young man with aspirations of opening his own chocolate factory, works his way up the chain at a job that pays him almost nothing. with the help of some newfound friends, he may just have what he needs to get started. sadly, he is being hunted by what the film calls ""the chocolate cartel,"" a group of people who wish to take wonka down. his magic and wonder are too much for them and that scares them. this film is silly through and through. the villains all made me roll my eyes on multiple occasions, but wonka was meant to be a family film and it more than succeeds at that.even though i was watching this film based on the name alone, paul king was the second reason. his writing and directing on both paddington films was stellar. those films are delightful and not only made for kids, but the emotional core and overall messages make them worth watching, and i feel the same way about wonka. it's a fun, charming family film, but the way the film wraps up at the end had me in tears. it focuses on a lot of silliness to keep kids engaged, but i truly feel that adults will get more than they think out of the emotional ending, as well as the references to the original classic film (especially in the music).i would also be remiss if i didn't mention the fact that this film is first and foremost, a musical. the trailers don't exactly portray it as such, but there are quite a few musical numbers. i thought the musical aspect added to this film and brightened it up many times. timoth√©e chalamet is also fantastic in the role, but he's great in everything, so i wasn't surprised there. if you're looking for a simple film that is fun and will likely put a smile on your face, look no further than wonka. i would gladly watch chalamet in a sequel to this.",8

"1432","wonka"," a bit of a wonky wonka","boristhemoggy",2024-02-07,"with dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor willy wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.remember this is an origin movie, exploring wonka's young life, and not remaking the original film. this review could be long, so if you just want a nutshell review, here we go:
is it fun? at times, yes.will i enjoy it? if you concentrate on the bits you like, yes.is it worth the price of a cinema ticket? no.will it get an oscar? absolutely not.now, wonka has been given a great cast. it's obviously benefitted from a huge budget. ($125,000,000) the cgi is very good, but not quite faultless. the story is great, and definitely worthy of a decent film telling.however...
timothy chalamet looks the part, but at his young age he simply does not have the ability to act with his voice and his face and body, as well as a seasoned actor. also his singing is excruciatingly ordinary, and the songs were not even close to films such as the sound of music or mary poppins. i can't even remember a single song and the film has only finished 3 hours ago. he was pretty flat, carrying out every scene in the same way without ever showing anything but that smile. it really felt like he was just along for the ride and not invested in the story. he clearly failed to understand the character of wonka properly and that showed in his performance. i think he was badly cast, he's not yet ready for a role like this. or, maybe he was just poorly directed?if you are going to make a musical you must make the songs tuneful, and memorable. not one song in wonka is either of those things, and because chalamet's singing isn't great, it fails as a musical.i dislike olivia colman, but it is fair to say her performance was one of the best in the film. she magically brought the character of mrs scrubitt to life and was one of the standout performances of the film. pure acting talent, nothing more to be said.i've never heard of paterson joseph but as slugworth he struck a brilliant balance between bad guy, and almost-comic book character. i could easily become a fan of his. he wasn't given the easiest part of the three chocolatiers, but his performance was very decent unlike the other two who i honestly felt presenetd as out of their depth amateurs.keegan-michael kay was another decent performance as the chief of police. he nailed the part of bumbling fool, but without being completely silly and slapstick childish.i felt an affinity for the characters indebted by mrs scrubitt, mostly because of their predicament. but had we not been told they were indebted i would not have guessed as they seemed to be happy and lived cleanly and were well fed. none of that indebtedness really rang true but the characters were played well anyway.the rest of the cast slipped between average and really poor, and i have no idea if that's down to acting ability or direction. i suspect the former as colman was so great in her part. sally hawkins shone in her tiny role, and i wonder why such a fabulous actress was given such a teeny part? it really doesn't make sense.the script was odd. i found odd sayings such as ""everyone being on the same page"" slipped into the dialogue and that really timestamps a film. there were a cluster of dialogue faux pas' such as that and i felt they had been put in there to satisfy people who like that nonsense kind of talk. overall the script wasn't bad, but it failed to light up situations and people. there was nothing at all that i felt moved me or touched me, and i took nothing memorable from it.it's made about $570,000,000 which isn't a huge amount for a film like that about a much beloved story. i suspect many who remember gene wilder bringing wonka to life were expecting something almost as good as that film. but while people new to wonka might enjoy it on some level, and i very much expect many to do that, it falls flat as part of the wonka world.overall i don't think it's a bad watch, especially if you're not familiar with willy wonka, or if you are a chalamet fan, but i am glad i dind't pay for a cinema ticket, and i won't be watching it again.",5

"1437","wonka"," too sugary for my taste","spanking_machine",2023-12-10,"there's a lot of things to say about this film, i guess we could call a prequel to the original willy wonka & the chocolate factory from 1971. sometimes filmmakers make amazing prequels -cruella (2021), comes to mind- other times not so much.the story takes us to the very beginning of the chocolate factory and the adventures and misadventures a young willy wonka had to face on his way of making his dream into reality.there's all sorts of new things happening in this movie. for instance we learn about how willy wonka and his first oompa loompa met and what had to happen for them to start working together -which added some color to the story, both figuratively and literally speaking-. another thing, which some die-hard fans of the original film were not happy about, is that they turned wonka into this joyful and agreeable creature - a gentle magician that pulls things out of his top hat ala mary poppins, if you will- someone that doesn't have a mad and scary side, totally unlike the previous interpretations of this peculiar character. so if you're one of those people that loved those unrestrained and darker scenes that we have seen in the previous films (yes i'm referring to the famous boat/tunnel of terror scene) well let's just say this might not be your cup of hot chocolate.also let's not forget this movie is a musical, therefore expect to hear songs. now whether the songs are as good as the original 1971 film, or whether they are any good for that matter, that too is open for debate.so all in all, i can understand why fans of the 1971 classic would be annoyed about some aspects of this movie, but let's be honest, the bar was high to begin with, however the question remains, is it not a good film? i kinda wish the first half of it was not as slow, the second half sort of makes up for it with some exciting thrills and action.in the end, i guess only time will tell whether this movie will stand the test of time or fade into obscurity like so many recent remakes, prequels and sequels * cough mary poppins returns cough *.",6

"1440","wonka"," disappointed","helenegulla",2023-12-10,"charlie and the chocolate factory is my all time favourite movie (2005 version). i watch it 2 times every year; on christmas eve and during the easter holiday. to be honest i was counting down the days until this premiere since they announced it, which was nearly a year!i was expecting it to be a little similar to the originals and that it would have something to do with christmas, however it didnt. i felt like i was watching oliver twist, not willy wonka. what disappointed me the most was the storyline. we get to know some of wonkas childhood in charlie and the chocolate factory, for instance that he grew up with a prestigious dentist father (dr.wonka) who refused him chocolate/candy and he was sent away for chosing candy over his father at the age of 11. in this movie the story is completely different, showing us a loving (poor) mother who makes him chocolate from scratch on their houseboat. he persues chocolate in the hopes of seeing her again. this doesnt fit what we already know, and i prefer the original version. it would be much better if they went with this in my opinion. i always assumed that he wanted to prove his father wrong, that was his motivation to success. the end of charlie and the chocolate factory where he made his father proud was moving.also, the discovery of the tonka beans and their magic is a big part of charlie and the chocolate factory. the ¬´little man with green hair and orange skin¬ª doesnt look like an oompa-loompa at all. he also talks english, not their language (which was fun). and the version of him going there and just finding 4 of their beans is boring compared to how it was originally. he basically just saw them right away, took them and left. it is a lovely movie, but there is a lot of signing (the songs arent even that great) and some scenes just doesnt make any sense. the scene where they milk the giraffe and start signing is cringy. i barely managed to watch it finish. all in all a fairly good movie, but nothing compared to charlie and the chocolate factory. i love that movie and all the harry potter movies (same creators), but this is just average. sorry. it felt rushed and just did not fill my expectations. hopefully someone else chares my opinion and makes a even better version in the future.",6

"1496","wonka"," pure magic fantasy illusion and chocolate","glori1491",2024-01-07,"for me, the film that i have enjoyed the most of 2023, one of the best of this year, this is how the celebration of disney's 100 years had to be. this film, which is an original prequel to the cholate factory, tells us about the beginnings of willy wonka, a half-wizard cholatero who in his childhood and youth always had a lot of magic, fantasy and illusion that guided him to follow his dreams and the dreams he created with his mother. wonka arrives in the city where the best chocolate shops are with the hope of making his own shop (the dream he always had with his mother), due to his innocence (since he saw the best in people, he didn't know how to read but he said that he trusted what others did), he arrived at a boarding house where he signed a contract that he did not know how to read (he was left owing 1000 coins, 27 years of his life), just as there were 4 other people in that house who also fell into this trap and the girl noodle with whom wonka made a great bond, wonka puts together a plan to sell chocolates and get his friends out of this prison and always take care of noodle, along the way he has to fight against a corrupt church and 3 owners of chocolate factories (which had a monopoly), takes us on a journey of music (beautiful music, with the song from the original film pure imagination and many originals), colors, chocolates, fantasy and illusion in which one gets lost and when you realize the movie ended up leaving our hearts with more hope, excitement, excitement and desire to eat chocolate. it shows us a great timoth√©e (truly one of the best actors of the time), who manages to make wonka his own character (nothing to envy of johny deep), with his own characteristics and he looks spectacular, associated with a great cast that manages to make an excellent film. i love seeing the strength that musicals have gained again in recent years, and they make us want to sing everything we do as the song said. this musical has some of the best musical scenes in recent years. and i'm going to close my review with my 2 favorite quotes from the movie: everything good in this world began with a dream. so keep yours, and the secret is not the chocolate, what matters is the people you share it with.",10

"1499","wonka"," a sweet and magical confection of a film!","msecaur",2024-01-31,"i would have completely passed this film over if not for the fact that it was written and directed by the brilliant paul king of ""paddington"" and ""paddington 2"". in anyone else's hands, it would have become yet another lifeless, overstuffed, unnecessary origin-story prequel. but in his, it becomes, like the paddington films (albeit with a bit less slapstick bear humor and far more music) an equally whimsical, quirky, wondrous, and warm film about how one person, just by being themselves, can change the world around them, as long as they remain positive and don't give up on their dreams.i've always felt that roald dahl's 1964 novel, while not without its dark moments, was more joyous than many of his later books, a wondrous ode to his love of chocolate and a giddy exploration of the wish-fulfillment of being handed the keys to your own candy factory. king has tapped into and run with this sweetness, but he keeps it tempered, just as dahl did, by following the mantra that adults are not to be trusted and make the best villains via his (and co-writer simon farnaby's) introduction of just enough grotesque, menacing, yet somehow funny grown-ups to keep things from becoming too easy for the protagonists without making the story too grim.speaking of protagonists, as the title suggests, this story is all about the man himself, willy wonka, and while it took a few scenes for me to get used to seeing anyone but the incomparable gene wilder in the role, timothee chalamet gives a wonderful performance that definitely grows on you. by the end of the film, he literally moved me to tears. as a sort of amalgam of chaplin's the little tramp and a young harry houdini, his youthful, wide-eyed wonka definitely leans more towards the warm-hearted, twinkly-eyed side of dahl's incarnation and wilder's interpretation than the nonchalant candy maker who calmly accepts the possibility of naughty children being boiled into fudge or thrown down a garbage chute. all young willy wants to do is make the world a better place with his chocolates. yet chalamet still manages to capture the eccentric, energetic, excitable, reckless, inventive man of the 1971 film version and roald dahl's novels without letting his quirks become overpowering (yes, i'm looking at you, johnny depp) such that it isn't a stretch to imagine that his wonka and the man he will eventually become are one and the same.timothee chalamet also pleasantly surprises with his singing and dancing skills, which come in handy considering that, in spite of what the trailers will tell you, ""wonka"" is an unabashedly old-fashioned movie musical courtesy of neil hannon's fun, catchy, and tuneful original songs. while chalamet may not be josh groban, he has a sweet, natural voice with lots of color and personality, not to mention a gorgeous vibrato. for my money, i would much rather buy a record of his over nick jonas or harry styles any day, and i hope that he continues to be given the chance to further develop and show off his skills.in short, ""wonka"" is a wonderful and unexpected surprise in more ways than one. king's childlike view of the world and his deftness at telling stories that are neither too clever for children yet too inane for adults matches perfectly with the world and words of roald dahl, a feeling clearly shared by dahl's grandson luke kelly, co-producer on this film and guardian of dahl's estate, who allowed ""wonka"" to be the first time roald dahl's characters have ever been used in an original story. worlds away from tim burton's nightmarish 2005 ""charlie and the chocolate factory,"" ""wonka"" instead meshes beautifully with roald dahl's original 1964 novel and the 1971 film, giving fond nods and easter eggs in abundance for those paying attention, while also managing to stand on its own feet as a great film, whether or not you've ever heard of oompa-loompas or let yourself explore a world of pure imagination before.",10

"1515","the marvels"," a fun time with three very likeable leads","kjproulx",2023-11-10,"when it comes to the character of captain marvel, the fan base has always seemed to be so negative. i personally have enjoyed brie larson's portrayal of the character and enjoyed the first film for the most part. hearing that her story was shifting to include two other marvel heroes as co-leads had me raising an eyebrow, but i'm always open to things changing. my biggest concern about the marvels before seeing it was the fact that two series' on disney+ seemed to be a prerequisite first. i've been following the entire franchise from start to finish (including the shows), and i really liked the character of ms. marvel, so i found myself excited. i can see how viewers who haven't followed the shows would be turned off though, which is a real problem this franchise is facing at the moment. let's dive deeper, but also review this film on its own, which i did have a good time with.the marvels picks up after the events of captain marvel, wandavision, and ms. marvel. at a mere hour and 45 minutes, the film jumps right into it. the three of them begin to switch places after being exposed to energy. they quickly have to learn to work as a team to stop a looming threat. the kree are back, led by dar benn (zawe ashton), and her motivations are all because of a storyline that feels forced to include captain marvel and something she did in the past. this was easily the worst part of the film, as i was completely uninterested in it. her power stems from a bengal, which ms. marvel has the other half of and that was far more interesting. sadly, the villain as a whole just felt like a device instead of a fleshed-out character. the villain almost hurt the film a little too much for me, but the trio of actresses here was a joy to watch.brie larson, iman vellani, and teyonah parris are absolutely stellar as a trio working together. their chemistry was so much fun to watch. it's easily the reason i'm giving the villain storyline a pass and saying i enjoyed the movie. the majority of the movie is about them learning to use their powers together and i couldn't get enough of it honestly. on top of that, the integration of kamala khan's family was hilarious and used perfectly. i also enjoyed the subtle, quiet moments where they share heart-to-hearts with one another. certain conversations between carol and monica actually had me tearing up. the subtle touches here and there were very nice. the action is surprisingly fun to watch and the cgi didn't stand out as much as it did to me in the first captain marvel film, but yes, the elephant in the room here is that this film isn't accessible to everyone, which is a real shame.this is the part that bothers me to even have to mention, but here we go. from iron man to avengers: endgame, there was always a plan and it was only a couple of movies a year to follow. i'm someone who chooses to follow everything, even if it's good or bad because i would like to see where everything eventually builds to. i can sense another finale in the coming years, but they are simply making far too many projects for the average viewer to follow. i fear that avengers movies won't even draw the crowds they used to once they finally come out. this frustrates me because the majority of the projects are still good for the most part. it's just that there's too much and far too many characters. this is coming from someone who likes or loves a lot of the newest characters, so i can only imagine how fans who have fallen off the franchise are feeling. anyways, we're here to discuss the marvels.in the end, the marvels is a solid popcorn flick that i sat back and had a good time with. if the cast didn't work so well together and the humour didn't work for me, i would be calling this a lacklustre movie all around. nia dacosta definitely pulled the best performances she could out of these actresses and i commend her for that. i also just have to say that the standout of this film is iman vellani. i loved her in ms. marvel and she shines again here. she's just so happy to be a part of this franchise and it really shows. there are certain scenes that will annoy viewers, but honestly, i recommend this one to fans of the mcu, unless you're someone who already dislikes any of these characters/actresses. otherwise, it's not great by any means, but i had a good time and i think others will too.",7

the main events were cut too short due the length of the movie, leaving the plot a little shallow. so this one could've actually been a little longer.even though i love cats, i think there were simply too many of them, considering the amount of screen time they actually got.the main villain was awkward. i couldn't tell if she was badly directed or if the acting was bad, but she just seemed to be really out of place. most certainly she was badly written.all in all, it was an okay movie with entertaining action bits and comedy. that's certainly more than we got to see from mcu in 2023 as a whole.",8

"1531","the marvels"," it achieves everything it sets out to do","livingwitness",2024-02-12,"all this movie was trying to be was a superhero movie that appeals to twelve-year-olds. it achieves that. if i had have seen this when i was twelve, it probably would have been my favourite mcu movie ever.i can see why a lot of people were unhappy with this one because it doesn't really do much beyond that, and there have been much better ones in the last few years. however, i think people are being a bit silly if they saw this movie and expected it to be anything other than a cgi heavy movie for 12-year-olds.for the most part, i do think this movie works, though. pretty much all the jokes land, which hasn't always been a given in the mcu movies of the last five years or so. the action sequences are middle of the road, but you can follow what's happening and there's at least some kind of point to them.i don't think the cgi in this movie is quite as good as the cgi in guardians of the galaxy 3. however, it never looks cheap, either. i also feel like they probably should have just picked an aspect ratio and stuck with it because changing the aspect ratio in certain scenes didn't really add anything. this was a problem thor: love and thunder had as well.overall, this movie was fine. there's been much better mcu movies over the years, but this is nowhere near as bad as some people are making it out to be.",7

"1537","the marvels"," the latest marvel film arrives in a rushed and scattered manner, leaving little to entertain you with.","movieman6-413-929510",2023-11-09,"the marvels is the sequel to captain marvel. this sequel is in-depth and written in part by nia dacosta, director of little woods and the 2021 candyman sequel.after captain marvel's (brie larson) final actions with the kree empire, the tyrannical kree dar-benn (zawe ashton) tries in her own way to return the kree empire to its former glory. these actions put other worlds at risk.captain marvel tries to stop dar-benn, only to find her powers tangled with those of monica rambeau (teyonah parris) and kamala khan (iman vellani). when one of them uses their powers, they switch positions with each other. the three must work together during this force entanglement to stop dar-benn.this new film from the marvel film series actually comes with some housework for the viewers. to clearly understand everything in this film, she actually expects you to be familiar with the first captain marvel film and the marvel disney+ series wandavision and ms. marvel. without this knowledge, there is a chance that you will not be able to clearly understand everything that exactly happened in this movie. a lack of this information can only make this film seem more obscure. furthermore, the film sometimes seems a bit rushed and scattered. this could also be because the three writers of the film are not yet at the beginning side. for nia dacosta, this is only her third writing effort. the other two writers have only written stories from tv series. although some of this series are also part of marvel, this unfortunately did not provide much further experience.when the characters use their powers and move places, it only makes the events in the beginning of the film even more unclear. especially when they don't seem to change places every time they use their powers, something that isn't really explained in detail in the film. the changing of superpowers is also something that has been used before in superhero films, such as in fantastic 4: rise of the silver surfer. even though this film had its limited aspects, she still managed to turn it into something comical every now and then.due to the rushed pace and small aspects of this film, there seems to have been little room for some light moments of comedy. the young iman vellani knows how to provide some cheerful moments, but unfortunately this is quickly overshadowed by the more serious tone of the rest of the film and her co-stars. brie larson and teyonah parris play characters who have a history with each other, but in this film they are given little time and opportunities to do something with it. this is samuel l. jackson's 15th marvel film project, but he doesn't get many opportunities to do anything special in this film and has just some room for light comedy moments. zawe ashton also plays more of a standard villain, which you as a viewer don't really care about.due to the rushed aspects behind the film, the visual effects do not always appear convincing. when a green screen or further cgi is used, this is unfortunately visible. the visibility of this visual effects word sometimes even takes you out of the story.",4
"1538","the marvels"," stronger than the first","masonsaul",2023-11-11,"the marvels is a lot better than the original even if it's still using sky beams 33 films in. the shorter run time helps a lot more than it hinders and it's just a really funny, wacky cosmic adventure that manages to be a contained story whilst still setting up exciting things for the future.brie larson is great, given so much more to work with this time so carol has more personality and greater depth. she's still as funny as before but more remorseful, dealing with both the legacy and fallout of her actions as a soldier as well as feeling guilt over not spending as much time on earth as she should've.teyonah parris gets the majority of the exposition yet still makes monica a fully fledged character again. there's an initial unease at being reunited with carol in these circumstances whilst still dealing with everything post blip that she's so good at conveying.iman vellani is the best though, improving everything with her presence. the enthusiasm she has for simply being in this world remains so genuine and as she's finally meeting her idol there's so much fun to be had when she's constantly freaking out. there's plenty of emotional heft too as she sees first-hand the sacrifice required to be a hero.samuel l. jackson is back to his fun loving version of fury which feels like a huge apology for secret invasion. zawe ashton is another one-note mcu villain who has fun chewing scenery with some solid motivation until the third act betrays it all for a big cgi fight that doesn't make sense for the character.nia dacosta's direction isn't entirely free of studio intervention or feeling occasionally voiceless but this is still some of the strongest direction recently, helped by the body swapping antics of the plot which means the action sequences have a unique selling point for this one.the mcu has serious ongoing issues with its use of cgi and there's no doubt there's some weak points here (with a likely chance the team was massively overworked). however, the film generally looks pretty good in that department and the added time thanks to a later release date clearly helped a lot.",7

"1543","the marvels"," mcus lowest point","milstar",2023-11-30,"the marvels is a film like barbie, made for women and by women, and yet, wasn't half as successful as barbie and majority of their audience were men. as one of them, who skipped barbie (as opposed to women who skipped this), i gotta say this was complete waste of time (and money). it's just a bad movie. but let's start from the beginning.brie larson wasn't a very good choice for any marvel superheroine, certainly not for an obscure character like captain marvel. but the movie came and the rest is history. and now its half-sequel is here. and boy, as i stated already, it was royally bad. the director, who skipped the post-production on the marvels middle-way thru, attempted to sell her film as wacky, goofy fun. i can only say this. the marvels is not wacky, but it is goofy. and goofy not in a good way. superheroes are goofy by default, but this took the game a step further.the plot is the biggest flaw. it lost its marbles after the first ten minutes and i didn't care about it for the rest of its 105mins running time. which seems too short for these kinds of films, although 105mins was too much for me. the biggest selling gimmick, our trio exchanging powers, even after all obscure explanations, never really made any sense and their switching powers seem to work only when filmmakers tell you they work. not one of the three heroines has a meaningful character arc, the movie should be about carol danvers, and while there was room for all three, i never had the feeling they were experiencing an emotional journey. kamala just wants to be there, monica acts like a job drone and carol in the search of something that is even unknown to her. even the villain is just a flat-out cardboard villain. people singing sequence is gross. kittens swallowing people as a means of transportation massive gross. music apart from generic bombastic tunes is meh, cgi atrocious, the editing a work of hack...a fail on very single level. the eponymous trio lacks chemistry. kamala's quotes are sophomoric, but given she is an overexcited teenage girl, that can be forgiven, monica seems the most level-headed of the trio, and brie surprisingly acted less robotic and more nuanced than in the original captain marvel (those trailers didn't do her justice), but not in a game-changing manner.i guess we are reaching now the twilight of superheroes. all pointing that similar fate awaits aquaman 2.",1

"1557","the marvels"," marvel best captain marvel film yet.","gusherpop",2023-11-11,"as with a lot of studio-created girl groups, the women fronting ""the marvels"" are carefully styled, wear coordinated outfits during their big numbers, have a few flashily choreographed moves and, because they've clearly put in the rehearsal time, know how to harmonize (more or less). the group has been created for maximum bankability, familiarity and relatability, and to that instrumental end, it delivers exactly what you expect of it and not a single thing, idea or beat more. its members are nice, even at their most ostensibly fierce, and so unrelievedly bland that it feels like an affront, especially to all the women here doing so much hard work.this is the 33rd movie in the marvel cinematic universe, which continues to expand even as its cultural interest and resonance diminish. ""the marvels"" will dominate the box office, of course, at least during its opening weekend, just because it will flood theaters. it's pointless complaining, i know (believe me), but it's frustrating what weak tea this movie is because the director, nia dacosta (""little woods,"" ""candyman""), has talent, the cast is appealing, and there's a lightly gonzo scene that shows you what the other 100 minutes could have been. it's almost as if the suits at marvel studios know it doesn't matter if their movies are any good. once again, brie larson plays captain marvel a.k.a. carol danvers, a former air force pilot who inadvertently picked up her superpowers once upon a time. she kept on flying throughout the decades, though sometimes without a craft, hurtling through space and fighting alongside the avengers all while maintaining her dewily youthful looks. when she first appears here, she is hanging out with her scene-stealing orange tabby, goose (played by tango and nemo), on her spaceship and doing something important-looking. soon, with goose perched on one shoulder - no spacesuits here - this very special cat lady is zipping off to a planet and into another over-plotted, overextended escapade. this time she's joined by two super-empowered beings from the small screen: kamala khan a.k.a. ms. marvel (iman vellani), a captain marvel superfan from jersey city (and disney+); and monica rambeau (teyonah parris), an astronaut (introduced as an adult in the series ""wandavision"") who's part of s. a. b. e. r. in the interest of moving this review along - and because i had no idea what nick fury (samuel l. jackson) was doing in space with a bunch of uniformed lackeys (other than barking orders with his usual gruffness) - here is how the movie's production notes describe s. a. b. e. r: ""a space station covertly acting as earth's first point of contact and defense from a rapidly expanding universe."" written by dacosta, megan mcdonnell and elissa karasik, ""the marvels"" reunites old friends and foes while introducing new characters and developments, all of which will presumably be folded into future installments, as is the marvel way. the big fights and minor tension are principally generated by the villainous dar-benn (zawe ashton), the ruler (or, in marvel-speak, supremor) of the kree people; she wields a mighty hammer and bears a grudge against captain marvel. in one of the larger set pieces, dar-benn takes brutal aim against other enemies. as terrified men, women and children flee and buildings fall, the scene briefly summons up visions of our world, which the movie otherwise phenomenally shows the true nature of marvel. as is always the case with marvel directors, dacosta's principal job seems to be to keep the greased gears moving as she folds in innumerable close-ups of happy, sad and mad faces, all of which are meant to remind viewers that their heroes are just like us, only super. to underscore this point, kamala's fangirl shtick goes on too long; the character is doodling images of her idol when the movie opens and sometime later wears a t-shirt emblazoned with captain marvel's image. once the character calms down, so does vellani, an appealing performer with comic timing who nicely bounces off both larson and parris. they, in turn, have been given an unfortunate surrogate mother-daughter dynamic that is fortunately underdeveloped because all you really want to do is watch goose, who's indeed golden.",9

"1564","the marvels"," a marvel of action, comedy, and fast pace. editing makes this movie feel incomplete","rgkarim",2023-11-10,"likes:fast pace
-this is not some convoluted tale, this is a very big focus on essentially entertainment, action, and fun.-the marvels puts the petal down to the floor and keeps that pace going to keep your mind entertained with very little downtime.-it amplifies the action, supports the comedy, and keeps the theme of fun without getting too lost in eternals like drama, which may be a plus for many given some of the dryer pieces on the tv.-thus, those wanting just that escapism, get this for the most part.funny, to a degree:
-the movie tries to be one point back to the 90s feel of the first captain marvel, while also trying out some new things that bring ms. marvel.-it worked for me. there were some really funny moments that had me in stitches. primarily nick fury and kamala's parents were the ones making me laugh, but i appreciated the effort and some mix-ups the movie did.-plus, the writing accomplishes some well-time lines to be entertaining and representative of the characters they built from the previous series.-plus, for those that love the current trend of stuffing a lot of jokes into a short time, this is a plus and a like for you as well.the acting:
-certainly not award winning, ground breaking, or even top caliber for the marvel universe, this cast still has some shine to it.-jackson's role might be sillier and less of the grit and grime i like, but the man's turn of phrase and looks still make me laugh and what he accomplished with this role.-vellani does her job well as the ever enthusiastic khan, a fan girl at heart with a lot of that pep and obsession that we see in the comics. she's light, airy, total fangirling, and yet surprisingly deep when she needs to be. certainly the sore thumb to the rest of the cast's dynamic, she achieves much in bridging a lot of things to come.-parris' role is much like her wandavision, feeling one part drama, one part comedy, and one part invigorating. she's got a decent grasp on the character's trauma, and delivers her lines well with fortitude, edge, but yet never going too far. i really liked her chemistry with so many characters.-larson is intense as ever, really diving into the extremes and keeping that chilling face of stone cold passive force. yet, the woman did dive into some comedy and i was pleased with some of the things she accomplished in her action hero role. most notably about the second half of the movie when she hit her stride, this was better for me than her previous roles.the story elements, a little
-the movie has some pockets of character drawing and actual ethical components that strike hard and paint the superhero world again in shades of grey.-danvers and rambeau's stories hold a bit more punch, some relevance to me making it surprisingly complex, and giving us that relief from the silly storms of stuttering and speaking that this movie is loaded with.-khan's story holds touching moments as well, which as a bridge really help add some moral lessons that might go well with an extreme fan to learn.-surprisingly, even the villain's motifs have some surprises and perhaps the most impressive thing about them, so that's a plus as well.the mid-credit scene
-it's the only scene so you can leave afterwards if you want.-however, it really helps with the excitement factor for many and showing the next steps coming to help straighten out the rumors of the mess that is marvel.-i won't say more, but this was one of the better end credit scenes that sort of felt like the original three phases.the action:
-the marvels' fighting moments finally start feeling like we have someone who understands a superhero movie fighting elements.-there are about three noteworthy fights i will call them, and these held the energy, pizazz, and character that movies like the avengers, winter soldier, guardians 1 and 3, and shang chi held.-a tad trending into stiff choreography at times, the movie fortunately uses the fast pace to really unload that comic book feel.-diversity settles in that though there is a common fight element, the scenery and the amount of things happening freshens it up a bit and make it really fun.-and that first battle, was probably the one that showed the most promise and was the peak, though the others aren't bad, but for a few things i'll mention soon.-overall, this action element was very pleasing to me.dislikes:the villain is forgettable:
-i agree with other reviewers i have read, the main antagonist is quite honestly one of the lesser villains i have cared about in a very long time.-dar-benn's plot is stronger than her character, lacking any real development, unique aspects, or even those memorable moments outside of some cool fashion, one notable speech, and her piercing eyes.-her origin story is simplistically boring and lasts less than thirty seconds, and any attempt to connect with her crew or rivalry, shockingly limited and lacking compared to others.-i held no connection or suspenseful purpose to her and felt she was an accessory given everything in this movie. the actress did a fine job, but not even her skills could save her character from the chief flaw of this movie.too much comedy?-it depends on your tolerance and like and style for this to be a dislike.-i love a good comedy that balances and delivers those lines perfectly and has a variety, which this does several times for me.-yet, the movie is a bit too dependent on the jokes, a lot of banter, nicknames, lines, and an aggressively comedic style that is too much for viewers like me.-khan's character can be super annoying, and her chatter grates my nerves before they had her try a new approach. while even her parents excessive judgement got a bit looser and haphazard that didn't work for me.-too many puns, an odd joke with singing feeling out of place, and even some dark comedy that feels out of sorts, the direction for this movie may have needed some fine tuning to match some of my other favorite movies.the visual effects:
-at times, they are amazing with what they have come up with to make this comic book come to life with the effects they do.-plasma bolts pop, punches and walls break, and there is color all around that is super exciting and that dazzle i love for the theater.-and then there are times where the effects look weak, forced, and editing has led to bad blends, stiff movements, and very cheesy looks that mirror a cel-shaded video game.-it's minor dislike at most times, but something i do agree that it's not their cleanest work.the editing/adaptations:
-the rumors state there was a lot of editing and i felt i could really see it in this film that hindered more than helped it.-the marvels has a lot of awkward and unimpressive elements that really tore into the experience they were hinting at in the first set of trailers.-while the edits give you that fast paced, escaping into a lot of fun and comedic moments, it really tore up the story, character involvement, and action in the grand scheme of things.-the origin stories and connecting points are forgettable, blink and you'll miss it moments, lacking that marvel polish.-obstacles that start as a set-up of being tough to crack are surprisingly easy to get over, and even the darker morale questions feel tagged on and bland.-one whole segment of the movie on a planet with water felt incredibly rushed, so much depth gone with very obvious transition struggles and an action scene that felt even more rushed than most.-and as for the other action moments, i feel these two lost some edge and suspense, perhaps even style from how much was left out, all too cram so much into this movie that feels like a launch point/wrap up/media launcher.-this dislike i feel is the worst part of this movie, for while it works to keep entertainment, the movie does take some serious hits in a complete story on its own and one that feels every element is needed.-throw in that i feel khan's story got chopped up enough, that the marvels now feels like more captain marvel 2 is the better title.the verdict
the hate for this movie is a bit stronger than i think needed after seeing the film. while certainly not my favorite to come out of the gate, the marvels holds a lot more to in terms of fun, fandom, and that entertainment complex than several other mcu adventures have been. i enjoyed the fast pace for the feel and drive, helping keep the comedy good, the plot moving, and the action having that superhero slam that the original phases mostly held for me. it's just a good time, and one that does not rely too much on the proceeding movies to enjoy, so you don't have to wait too much given they fill in the gaps. it's purely going to be mind-numbing entertainment and mostly escapes some of the other themes marvel got caught up on. yet, the movie's cuts, while entertaining, really did a number on the movie feeling entirely about the marvels. origin stories are highly reduced, impasses are surprisingly easy to get through, lots of shifting around to try to keep all pieces in the movie, an entire section feeling very rushed, and action that feels too short are all things that really feel incomplete to me. a director's cut is certainly needed for fans like me who want all these things extended upon, especially the forgettable villain that has promise, but just gets lost to the comedy and time constraints of this movie. still, it's not the horrible piece others call it to be for me, but yet feels like there is still some organizational needs to helping get them back on track.my scores are:
action/adventure/fantasy: 7.5-8.0
movie overall: 6.5-7.0.",7

"1569","the marvels"," give ms. marvel the keys to the mcu already.","pjtaylor-96-138044",2023-11-19,"'the marvels (2023)' may feel like relatively minor mcu, but it's honestly better than quite a few of marvel's other recent projects. it's getting a bad rap seemingly because superhero fatigue is settling in, as it's really no worse than (or all that different to) any of the other lesser - yet still enjoyable - entries in its wider series. its poor box-office performance isn't really anything to do with the movie itself, as the weak marketing campaign has meant that a lot of people just don't seem know it's actually out and those who do would rather catch it on disney+ when it inevitably drops there in a couple of months. speaking of the soon-to-be-more-expensive streaming service, the picture does kind of feel like something that ought to have premiered straight on the small screen. it's not that it's bad, but rather that something seems ever-so-slightly off about the whole endeavour. the narrative never quite gels together into something truly cohesive or, indeed, essential. the parts are all there and the a-to-b-to-c of it all lines up perfectly fine, but a lot of it feels like it's retreading old ground and the newer elements don't really get all that much time to shine (for example, some scenes play out like the culminations to character arcs that just aren't in the film). however, despite its legitimate rough patches and a general haziness that gets all the more prevalent in retrospect, the picture is quite a bit of throwaway fun once it gets going. this is mainly thanks to the compelling central concept that sees the three heroes switch places whenever two or more of them try to use their powers at the same time. this leads to a couple of really entertaining action sequences that are impressively choreographed and consistently kinetic, with the first major switching fight being the highlight of the entire affair. the other major reason the piece works as well as it does is iman vellani, whose kamala kahn is an absolute delight whenever she's on screen. the enthusiasm of the character seems to stem from the genuine enthusiasm of the actor; this energy seeps out of the screen and straight into your heart, putting a smile on your face whenever ms. marvel gets a moment in the spotlight. the other two leads, brie larson's captain marvel and teyonah parris' professor marvel (?), are both solid as well, don't get me wrong, and the supportive dynamic between the three main characters holds the story aloft even in its weaker moments. the youngest of the trio is clearly the most endearing, though, and i kind of wish the piece had focused more on her as a proper sequel to her series. the villain is very weak and some elements of her plan don't quite line up, but she does what she needs to and acts as a formidable foe for the good guys without threatening to steal a single scene from them. the other side characters, including kamala's family and nick fury, are as enjoyable as they've ever been and raise the quality of what could have been a fairly weak b-plot (as does a certain cat-like creature). ultimately, this really isn't a bad effort. it's perfectly serviceable popcorn entertainment that's competently constructed from familiar materials (even if it lacks the style of some of director nia dacosta's other work). it's as fun as it is forgettable, an enjoyable - if undeniably minor - entry in an ever-expanding cinematic universe. it's pretty good, and it's certainly better than you may expect given its generally poor reception.",7
"1570","the marvels"," the flopvels: hollywood is not making movies for profit anymore. or for entertainment.","mgicnick",2023-11-11,"here we have not just another financially disastrous so called ""flopbuster"" , but the mother of all mcu flopbusters to date with the movie scoring negative records. marvel/disney did it again, they managed to spend too much for an underwhelming final product that would have made sense only as a 30 million production going straight to streaming (in which case i may have awarded a higher score) not as an aspiring blockbuster, which begs the question if they are totally out of touch with reality there at disney. the marvels is a watchable movie only to stream while waiting for a pizza delivery or to take the kids to see but not good enough by a long shot to make mature audiences flock to the cinemas to offset the massive production and advertising budget.the movie is trying too hard to be funny and lighthearted while wasting what used to be one of the most iconic hollywood actors until he started playing such roles, samuel l. jackson, who is reprising a mere shadow of ""nick fury"" character that use to make billions at the box office not so long ago; now he is an inconsequential minor cheerleader orbiting an incoherent bunch of female spandex-clad superheroes fighting a badly cast, totally unconvincing, instantly forgettable female arch-nemesis. simplistic shallow story that we've seen many times but done way better, no suspense, disconnected action, characters with the depth of a pothole no one cares to identify with or remember as soon as the movie is over, unnecessary messy cgi, with a badly done touch of sentimentality and feline cuteness, it's not worth the fuss, just wait for it to stream if you really need to watch a pretty average movie.the ""superhero fatigue"" explanation cannot be the deciding factor here when the product is actually bad and not made to appeal to the masses and thus turn a profit.",1
"1571","the marvels"," a lot of misses with little payoff","hasanyasinhere",2023-11-11,"1. the villain is written very poorly and is mostly there because of the plot points which they want to show in the movie instead of the organic growth which you would expect. the villain was very shallow and her acting was very sub-standard compared to thanos, ronan, high evolutionary and even hela. she laked scene presence and fear factor was lacking.2. monica rambeau character is really like a side supporting character whose job is to say the lines so that the conversation can move forward and the audience know that the scene is going to end. in the whole movie she was always coming up with the solution without showing how she figured it out. maybe these scenes were cut from the final draft.3. nick fury is a shadow of himself and is no longer the guy with the plan. instead he is just there to reassure others and to always tell the stakes and to beg for help. this all makes him like he's not worthy of the status he's been given and is more like a poser.4. the cats subplot and the singing planet subplot was very cringe for most of the fans in my cinema and they could have added some different stories instead which could have showed more engaging dialogues, scheming etc.5. carol danvers was better in this one than captain marvel movie still she is still acting like this lone ranger with so many plot holes in her story which no body knows about like where has she been all these years, does she have any other friends or any other stories or battles which she was busy with in the past years. she could not show more about her character, her motivation which was a shame. she stills feels alot forced than organic.6. ms. marvel was better than her 2 other co stars and did show more of her motivation and character but still at time she was too annoying, behaving like a child without any concerns for the situation that she was in. she should have acted more like how peter was in infinity war, like how he was fearful but was trying to act brave for tony but you could see that he was scared himself and you could see that he wanted leadership from tony and dr. strange and was following along their orders which was much more believable. in the marvels it was lacking and ms. marvel was acting like nothing serious is going on and that everything will be fine and that she's confident.overall, the movie did not deliver and the overall story is forgetful and very isolated as well.",2

and when did she and tessa thompson's character become such close friends?? i thought i'd hate the singing planet part, but it wasn't bad; didn't enjoy it, didn't hate it either.i was confused about how they got 'untangled'. maybe i missed something, but i don't think it was properly explained. it also felt quite unrealistic that, out of everyone in the mcu, only these three characters had light powers. i would have expected more characters to be entangled, but i guess that might have complicated things.it felt longer than it actually was, but in a good way, like the runtime was filled and the movie didn't drag. but it also felt like some parts of the plot were simply missing.there was excessive hugging, i didn't care them by the last two or so. also they just moved into monica's house? i really love the credit scene and what it sets up for the future, however people complain movies these days are just set ups for others. i don't think this movie did that too unnaturally. only the ending.first movie in a while that's made me feel like superhero fatigue may not be a thing, other than gotg 3. like loki s2 is currently making me feel like there's superhero burnout.i believe the chemistry between the characters could have been portrayed better, but i don't necessarily see it as a flaw from this particular movie, more like an issue with the movies/shows that preceded it. as mentioned earlier, the fan-girling between ms. marvel and captain marvel makes sense. but, the connection between aunt carol and monica, despite knowing the backstory, didn't quite hit the emotional chords. that emotional aspect, is what the movie was missing in general.i think with so many movies and shows, plus significant gaps between a movie and its sequel, there's a risk of losing the emotional connection between the two. the time span from ""captain marvel"" to ""the marvels"" is quite extensive. nowadays, marvel movies seem more focused on connecting superheroes' stories rather than emphasizing the emotional connections. it's all about how the multiverse links up and how many characters can be packed into a movie to showcase a unified world. it's fun at times but feels unnecessary at others. i don't see it as a flaw specific to ""the marvels"" movie; it seems more like an overarching issue within the mcu. reminds me of diseconomies of scale lol. i wonder if star wars franchise has the same problems of being too large.monica feels like a character that should've stayed as a side character, at least for now because it felt like she was promoted too quickly to shared lead roles.i feel like ms. marvel was the only character with real depth from having her own series and being more recent. captain marvel had a movie, but the issue is that people seem to dislike her because she only appears when needed, kicks ass, and then disappears without much exploration. i'd genuinely love to see more of her and her intergalactic adventures. the movie's villain comes from a 30-year stretch of captain marvel's adventures that we never got to see, and it feels like they just threw her in to compensate. similarly, captain marvel's character seems under-explored, and it's disappointing because i wish they delved deeper. i love her, but her depictions have always felt a bit lackluster. it's frustrating that both captain marvel and brie larson have so much potential but aren't given enough to work with. so i get why people hate her, but i wish marvel did something to change that. this movie helps, but she wasn't the highlight of the film.ms. marvel truly carries movie; it felt more like her film than a captain marvel sequel. if you liked the ms. marvel tv series, this movie brings that same kind of fun to the table. and i'll say it again-i won't believe anyone who claims it's not fun because, despite its flaws, it's undeniably fun. just being a hater if you don't accept that it's fun at the very least. at the very least.edit after seeing some reviews: i find that those giving sub 3/10 ratings are a bit excessive- close the extremes of rating either 10/10 or 1/10. i typically reserve such low ratings for movies like ""cosmic sin (2021),"" morgan freeman's ""vanquish,"" ""beast,"" or ""it's a wonderful knife""-movies that are genuinely dull and uninspiring lol.",6

movie at the theatre due to disney discontinuing the release of any movies/tv shows on dvd/blu-ray where i am (not to mention doctor who, which they now own, will no longer screen on free-to-air tv for the first time since it began here. thanks a bunch, disney!). i refuse to basically be bullied into getting disney+, and consequently have missed out on all the marvel shows. so when the first trailer for this movie made it seem like 'the ms. marvel & photon movie (guest-starring captain marvel)', i wasn't overly enthused since it was carol/captain marvel who i wanted to see more of (after actually having *liked* her first film...'unpopular' as that opinion may be), whereas i knew nothing about these other two.the movie begins with kree warrior, dar-benn (sorry, supremor dar-benn), digging up an all-powerful bangle (someone really needs to round up all these powerful magical items in the universe and hide/destroy them so villains can't keep getting their mitts on them), while the other one is in the possession of captain marvel fangirl, kamala khan/ms. marvel (just as well i'd at least seen the trailers for her tv show via youtube and thus was prepared, otherwise i probably would've been wondering wtf was up with the animated daydream sequence). meanwhile, carol's living a pretty solitary life in space (with only that scene-stealing flerken, goose, as company), though she can at least communicate with fury. for those who felt carol was 'too serious'/'lacked personality' previously (give her a break, she had amnesia!), she seems to have more life in her now and her dynamic/friendship with fury remains as entertaining as ever...that is until she sticks her hand in some ""mysterious glowing sh#t"", then he becomes none-too-pleased with her.though she's not the only one, as kamala and monica rambeau (daughter of carol's old friend, maria) make the same mistake, causing all three to unintentionally switch places whenever they use their powers...making for something 'different' with the fight scenes to what we've seen before, as the characters are constantly doing swapsies whilst fighting bad guys, trashing kamala's house as a result (on the upside, she eventually gets to meet her hero and fangirls out, apologising for the copyright infringement on the captain marvel name with her self-appointed 'ms. marvel' and determined to give monica a superhero name too). once the three 'marvels' come together, it's fun seeing them interact and the different dynamics they have. there's the uncomfortable tension between carol and monica (who's mad at carol for not being there to support her following the death of her mum, maria. um...she was busy saving the universe, cut her some slack!), while kamala learns to tone down her hero-worship of captain marvel, after witnessing carol making the tough decision to abandon some skrulls (rescuing the ones she can) after dar-benn's attack.it's not easy being carol, who gets blamed for everything, is met with suspicion/hostility by kamala's family (who i understand being concerned for kamala, given her age/the fact she's involved in stuff that could get her killed, but they seem fine with monica, whilst resenting carol, and they wear a bit thin after a while), and although carol's the one to defeat dar-benn, it's monica who gets the 'big hero moment' at the end, closing the hole to another reality that dar-benn ripped in space. it almost feels like monica's the lead, while carol's just there to support her. eventually monica learns the real reason carol wasn't around (after destroying the supreme intelligence, which had unintended consequences that led to dar-benn's planet dying and now she's stealing resources from other planets to save hers, carol felt too ashamed to return) and forgives her 'aunt'. still, the last scene of the movie (mid-credits) is all about monica reuniting with her mum from the other reality she gets trapped in (kelsey grammer also makes a cameo as beast, looking better/more beast-like than he did in his previous appearances) and so this captain marvel sequel's ending isn't even *about* captain marvel.i waited around for a post-credits scene, but was just met with a blank screen and what sounded like a flerken barfing up something. speaking of, goose once again proves to be the true hero by hatching a litter of flerken kittens whose ability to swallow not just objects, but people as well (whilst keeping them alive), proves crucial...though too bad this wasn't thought of when the skrulls needed rescuing. as previously mentioned, brie larson's much more 'livelier' in her performance this go-around (though she also gets some decent emotional/dramatic moments), this was my introduction to both teyonah parris's monica (who spent the majority of her time spouting technobabble/science gibberish and i wasn't that fussed on until after she forgave carol, then she got more likeable) and iman vellani's kamala (who's entertaining, even if she overdoes the screaming/""oh my god!"" exclamations a bit...though at least it's warranted when she sees what goose can do for the first time) and i appreciated the montage of the trio teaching themselves how to work with the whole swapping-places-whilst-using-their-powers thing.zawe ashton as dar-benn (who's much more fetching than her smurf predecessor) did what she could playing yet another mcu villain who's doing bad things for what is, in their mind, 'the right reasons', but when the 'marvels' show her mercy/try to do her a solid, she threatens kamala's life, then goes all kamikaze (what is it with accusers exploding? first ronan, now her...find another way to die!). it's a shame that test audiences apparently didn't respond well to an extended sequence on a planet populated by people who communicate through song (i imagine it got trimmed), as it was actually one of the movie's more memorable/fun scenes. i personally feel the ott hate for this film is unwarranted, as it actually wasn't as bad as i'd feared (and with a ringing endorsement like that, how can you *not* want to watch it?).",7

"1635","the marvels"," bland, lazy, and uninspired...the marvels is anything but marvelous, not even as a marvelous disaster.","darwinskid",2024-02-10,"the marvels is exactly the sort of movie that critics and trolls would dismiss the output of marvel studios back when the marvel cinematic universe was in its second and third phases - shallow, childish nonsense with empty spectacle. the actors and director try but ultimately the story is too undercooked with not enough heart and soul put into it, and it rushes everything that there is just not enough time to properly invest into the characters.since the terrible box office run, i have come across many attempts to defend this motion picture, and i have also seen some people try to justify their argument that the reason why its performance was terrible was a result of an atypical situation. each and every one i must say has not been either compelling or sound in logic, so to save a reader the trouble, i am going to list the most common ones you may run into, and my reactions towards them.""it's not a perfect movie."" well, no movie is. even the top 10 movies of the internet movie database's top 250 list have technical and continuity errors listed for them, so while one can argue they are perfect in various ways, evidently they are not in all ways. statements of this sort are just empty ones if we're being honest, because it admits that there are issues within the picture that cannot be completely defended and spun around to appear of great quality.""i didn't hate it."" well, aren't you being kind. here's a newsflash for you though, you are not supposed to hate it. 99% of films are designed with the intention that the audience will come away liking the picture, even if the filmmakers did not set out to entertain or excite the viewer with spectacle and pretty colors. the people who constructed this very movie were hoping to draw enough favorability from the general population to bring in amazing profit. these statements are neither a compliment or a very good endorsement if you ask most people.""it's just a fun movie, do not overthink it!"" this argument would probably work if the film was not built on the foundation of a cinematic universe that has been up and running since 2008, which has a history of producing content regarded as some of the best in superhero cinema in particular and blockbuster filmmaking in general. a silly, no-brainer yarn is a step-back for marvel studios after all they have accomplished in the past, and they shouldn't settle for it, either. furthermore, the movie asks a lot from the viewer, if you did not see either wandavision or ms. marvel on disney+ you will be very lost, but to make matters worse there is a lot of plot mumbo jumbo that is introduced in the film that is too shy in detail that you feel another movie or series is missing for better context. the plot is just not as simple as it wishes to present itself as, and rather than coming across as complex, it is coming across as complicated nonsense.""people who didn't like it are allergic to having fun at the movies!"" this is such a strawman argument. sometimes the problem lies with the filmmaking itself than of the individual, who may (for all you know) have come in wanting to very much enjoy it.""it bombed at the box office because society rejects female led movies."" yet the very same year, barbie a major box office success. the original captain marvel picture also performed good in theaters in 2019. other female led films and television series also have performed well, why this movie underperformed is the same reason why many male led films underperformed - lack of interest and lack of faith in the product.""it bombed at the box office because of the strikes."" yet barbie and other movies released in the year did fine despite of the strikes.""just you wait, in a few years it will be regarded as the blade runner for a new generation."" i genuinely question if the people making this argument have even seen at least one version of blade runner or really understand why it went from a box office failure to an acclaimed work of science fiction filmmaking.such a disappointment, i was hoping marvel studios would aim higher for a follow-up to captain marvel, i liked the ms. marvel series quite a bit, and while i had issues with wandavision i did think teyonah parris was quite good as monica rambeau and thought the conflict between her and carol danvers could have played out very interestingly on screen, but it is dealt with fairly quickly.the worst marvel studios has made to date? no, but it is not far from holding the title.",NA

"1670","the marvels"," could have been great if there was actually plot!","moviewarfare",2024-01-21,"i found the first captain marvel movie to be relatively enjoyable. i had a lot of gripes with it but it was okay for the most part. however, marvel studios has been in a sort of downward spiral since endgame so my hopes weren't high for this. so is this a marvellous entry or another to add to marvel's recent dumpster?one of the big issues in the first captain marvel was how incredibly stoic and bland captain marvel was. there was nothing emotionally engaging about her character. the sequel does improve upon this aspect by making her less stoic. she has more of an emotional and some actual proper reaction to things occurring. she also shows a fair amount of emotionally vulnerable moments, especially concerning her relationship with monica and her mother, rambeau. there are 2 strong scenes with her. one is a flashback and another where she is opening up is something i wish the film had more of.a key element of this movie is that if captain marvel or monica or ms marvel use their powers at the same time then they will swap places. the first act of this movie is very entertaining because of this. there is a great action set piece in the first act where all 3 end up fighting in different locations but keep swapping during it. the biggest highlight of this film is iman vellani as ms marvel. she is extremely likeable and her performance is wonderful. she is enjoying every moment in every scene and it feels like the actor is having fun. it also has a kind of cool mid-credit scene.unfortunately, this is where the praises end. the plot is incredibly paper-thin. the hero has to stop the villain, that is it. there are no layers or depth to anything in the plot or proper character development or arcs. the plot is so bland that the movie adds a pointless side quest that adds almost nothing to the main narrative. we have a planet where everyone sings and it is as stupid as it sounds. it happens and it is just so out of left field. it's not funny, if anything it is very cringy. i hoped that they would at least do something special with the singing planet, maybe they would fight by singing or have special singing weapons or something. however, they just fight normally, so what was the point? there is also a side plot with the flerken, the alien cats, that comes out of the left field and is a pointless distraction that has nothing to do with the villain.on that note, the villain dar-benn might be the worst villain in the mcu. she is the new leader of the kree as her planet was put into chaos due to captain marvel destroying the supreme intelligence. this could have been an interesting element as from her perspective, captain marvel is the villain that destroyed her planet. if they showed more of her struggles at being a leader, how terrible the planet has become and how she is genuinely doing this at the goodness of her heart for her home, she might have been interesting. sadly this is not the case, despite having a sympathetic motive, she is just overly aggressive to everyone, including her allies. she is a one-dimensional villain who never becomes much of a real character with any depth. she is also somehow able to fight all 3 protagonists and has a hammer-like ronan from guardians of the galaxy despite having no power stone which is never explained.my biggest disappointment is monica's, ms marvel and nick fury's role in this movie. monica doesn't do much at all apart from spouting exposition and being a macguffin. her now sour relationship with captain marvel is only touched upon a bit and barely explored. she just ends up following captain marvel for the whole movie and doing some things near the end. this is also the same for ms marvel who is also very underwritten. her being a big fangirl of captain marvel is the only reason she is here. she has no character arc or development. this is a shame as she could have been used in more effective ways. she could have been the contrast to captain marvel. a naive, idealistic hero vs a battered and burnt-out hero. ms marvel could help captain marvel to lighten up and be more hopeful again while she learns how it isn't all fun and games and there are a lot of responsibilities with being a hero. unfortunately, she is just comic relief and that is it. nick fury is just kind of there. the movie is just very tonally inconsistent. we can go from a quite moving scene to something so incredibly dumb and stupid within minutes.overall, what an absolute shame this movie ended up being. it is so gut-wrenching to see what mcu has become since endgame. all the heart and effort put into their films are nowhere to be seen any more. i do have a small glimmer of hope that they are going to do better in 2024 onwards. they only have 1 mcu movie in 2024 which is making me hopeful that they are slowing down and putting effort into their future project. if captain marvel 3 even happens, i hope they write a plot this time.",3

"1689","the marvels"," mcu nuggets, not much else","tmauthor23",2023-11-20,"ask yourself this: would meryl streep make a good super hero? or robert deniro? the argument here is that even in the hands of an oscar winner, a comic book hero demands a very tricky performance to succeed. too serious, you get the green lantern. too goofy, you get howard the duck. even oscar winning directors (the eternals) can fail to understand the balance between drama and spandex jammies.the movie does little to build on captain marvel's exploits. instead, in its short running time it focused on developing the relationship with the other two leads, monica rambeau and kamala khan. the central theme revolves around an alien (kree) civil war and a new rip in dimensional space. what ensues is a mishmash of plot points involving the three leads attempting to seal the rip in time space, and untangling their powers, while the alien war creates multiple issues within the movie and the broader mcu. we get more info on the sword organization and the saber space station in an already crowded acronym landscape.it's confusing, to say the least. other than small roles (samuel jackson as nick fury as one example) by capable actors, larson is the lone acting presence required to do lots of heavy lifting; but she struggles to bring any sympathetic beats in her performance, opting for a stoic and stiff presentation. it's all too serious and too self involved to care much. and khan's juvenile approach feels better suited to her disney+ tv series, which is intended for a younger audience.the potential tie in to other films may interest die hard fans, but all in all the film fails to entertain and provide anything new. this is a recurring trend in recent mcu movies, that all appear burdened with connecting the dots between earlier films and the many marvel tv shows disney continues to pump out. this is unfortunate. for every wandavision we get a shehulk or the doa secret invasion.and it's not just marvel that's suffering this treatment. for every season one of the mandalorian, or andor, we get a boba fett or an ahsoka. so star wars gets ill served by the disney studio too.not recommended.",2

"1707","the marvels"," a missed catch in the marvel cinematic universe!","godfather0219",2023-11-27,"to me, ""the marvels"" (captain marvel 2) can be considered the worst performance by marvel in terms of basic skills to date. whether it's the script, action sequences, or the pacing of comedy elements, all have glaring issues, especially in editing, which is simply astounding. the arrangement of some scene transitions is almost as problematic as in ""scarjo"", which is truly shocking.what's subtle is that there are many places in this film that could have been developed, and the director also understands this, so those parts are highlighted. for example, the relationship between captain marvel and monica, or the plot where ms. marvel should have been disappointed in captain marvel, which would have allowed her to grow further in her understanding of heroes, are all obvious areas for development.however, after these parts are pointed out, they are casually passed over with ""pitch perfect""-style sisterly bonding, ultimately making the whole of ""the marvels"" like a game of catch. the ball is potential; you can always clearly see the ball, but both sides keep dropping it, with only a few successful catches. in the end, because the ball is too conspicuous, it actually highlights the chaos of the whole game.furthermore, the acting in ""the marvels"" is a bit confusing. among the main characters of the film, almost only iman vellani, who played ms. marvel, turned in a sufficiently complete and consistent performance. as for brie larson, who played captain marvel, and teyonah parris, who played monica, both give a sense of being at a loss, appearing indecisive between seriousness and comedy.as for the main villain played by zawe ashton, she was originally a boring character with no play, so it's natural that she didn't perform much. conversely, samuel jackson's nick fury, just after the events of the series ""secret invasion"", suddenly became the kind of character who keeps making jokes and sarcastic remarks, making people feel that this is not the same character at all. so like captain marvel and monica, it has less to do with their acting skills and more to do with the script of this entire movie, which is overly fragmented in style.interestingly, although the problems are so obvious, the overall level of ""the marvels"" is probably about the same as ""thor: the dark world"", and there is still some entertainment value. at least for me, it's easier to bear than recent films like ""shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings"", ""thor: love and thunder"", ""black panther: wakanda forever"", and ""ant-man and the wasp: quantumania"", and it's more entertaining.in summary, looking at the hidden segments, ""the marvels"" indeed holds an important position in the marvel cinematic universe. it's just a pity that those basic skills, especially in terms of editing, are handled too poorly. at least from my personal estimation, next year's golden raspberry awards will likely not miss this film...ps: by the way, i think that park seo-joon's planet can be considered the biggest highlight of the whole film. but because of this, the complete lack of explanation about the fate of that planet in the later plot is also a surprisingly casual arrangement that can even affect the depiction of the main characters. honestly, i think the comedic level of that planet, even if it were used to directly make a one-season sitcom, wouldn't pose much of a problem...",2

movie review -the marvels review: nia dacosta brings the first ever female superheroes assembled version with the marvels, featuring three mcu superheroes. brie larson as carol danvers, teyonah parris as monica rambeau, and iman vellani as kamala khan join forces against dar-benn, played by zawe ashton. this is the first time that we have three leading ladies and a female antagonist together in a marvel studios' film. that adds one more reason why this film should attract more females to cinemas. however, i, as a male viewer, didn't have any issues watching and enjoying it. the marvels has to be one of the most comically funny superhero movies in recent times. gotg 3 and thor's cosmic adventure did attempt that organic comedy but couldn't bring it out the way they wanted. here, the marvels does it. and it's so visually attractive. some films look grand on imax and are made for such experiences. the marvels is certainly that one. what this film lacks is emotional entanglement and usp factors that define the overall motive. if you aren't looking for that, then be assured, you'll have a blast watching the marvels this diwali.carol, aka captain marvel (brie larson), has destroyed supreme intelligence at kree land, which makes things worse for the locals. amongst them is dar-benn (zawe ashton), and she is off to settle the score with carol, aka the annihilator (a pet name they gave to captain america). she harnesses the power of the band (a similar bangle kamala khan has) and pairs it with her staff, named the universal weapon, to tear apart a jump point in space. more jump points mean more problems in the timeline and more destruction. the trio of the marvels-captain marvel, monica rambeau (teyonah paris), and kamala khan (iman vellani)-must assemble to stop dar-benn from destroying earth and other planets, but there is a problem. all three female superheroes possess similar powers that are connected to the power/light and the jump point has made their powers entangled. whenever they use power, they switch places, as in, they transport through time spaces. will the trio overcome the problem and find a way to stop dar-benn?it's no secret that the marvels is the mcu's shortest movie ever, and let's hail the screenplay writer, editor, and director for that. 105 minutes is the full runtime, and you have 10 minutes of ending credits in that, so the ride is actually only about 95 minutes long. you find your seat, finish your popcorn, and half the film is over. you then put your hands on cold drinks and samosas, and the film is over. hell yes, it's that super-fast! mcu needed a break from some of those boring flicks that always felt 15-20 extra long, and here the marvels did it. they were reading a lot of reviews, i guess. even nia was of the same opinion. when it starts, when you are in midway, and when it ends, you don't even get time to calculate that. it's fun at all-time high for the mcu, but the only problem is that it's too predictable.kamala has a bangle, so that makes her equally powerful as dar-benn, and eventually, they win. it's too mainstream, man. kamala's fangirling looks cute in the beginning, and since she is a teenager, it all looks so humorous. but after a while, the same fangirl moments start getting on your nerves, and you feel like, ""is captain marvel a god?""we didn't know it"". the musical parts are hilarious. you don't get a moment to analyse what just happened and why you laughed. but a moment later, it all feels soapy. are we into an opera show? i asked my friend on the right seat, and he was already scratching his head. kamala can't use her powers to clear the mess at home. why? carol can't tell about her story from aldana, but she can take kamala and monica there. what's the logic? dar-benn's end and monica's sacrifice are so overly dramatic, as if we didn't know about the end credit scene. oh wait, there is a huge surprise in the end credit scene, and i should advise you not to leave your seats before that.brie larson's performance as captain marvel is maybe a typecast, but that's the best thing about her. cm has to be how fans imagine her, and she has that certain appeal beyond her glamour. iman vellani is set to win the hearts of all teenagers who watch the movie. her accent and innocence just can't be hated or disliked. she is the fan girl you want to be; she's lost in a fantasy, but that's okay for that age. when she was dancing at aladna, the entire theatre was hooting. it wasn't that high of a moment, but you know, sometimes your character and your portrayal make it bigger. teyonah parris, as captain rambeau, has done well in that emotional scene, while the rest of the time she was just passing the time with a decent act. zawe ashton has been impressive, be it in terms of looks or that ferocious attitude despite such a glamorous face. zenobia shroff's possessive mother and mohan kapur's urdu dialogues are going to impress indians, while samuel l. jackson's fury remains unshakeable. saagar shaikh, gary lewis, park seo-joon, and other supporting cast members are okay.talking about visuals, the marvels is a cinematic treat. i have been lucky to get a chance to see it at imax, and that has certainly escalated my viewing experiences. the visual effects are simply beautiful. the fight sequences are breathtaking and so well choreographed. the first action sequence when the leading ladies keep switching places, and then in the ending when they again switch places under some boundary against the antagonist, are enough to recommend this film for big-screen viewing. i also love the sound effects of imax. when your seats vibrate during noisy scenes, you feel like living the moment in real life, and the marvels has some scenes of that standard. nia dacosta has made a super entertaining film, no doubt. it's just cliched, that's all. from the basic surroundings to every major conflict, everything is predictable. that's the biggest issue with the marvels. some scenes go overboard while trying to make a funny impression, but they work against the film, especially that mediocre climax. so much hype around the band and dan-berr and you don't even give it a proper, large-scale conclusion? the marvels lacks a few textbook things like this, while the rest of the film is super entertaining and full of joy. take your families and enjoy the female superheroes' assembled version from marvel studios this diwali. don't worry, the cat won't eat you.rating - 5/10*",5

"1714","the marvels"," the worst movie in the mcu","jimpapadakis81",2023-11-26,"getting right into it, this movie has quite possibly the worst villain in the mcu (and given the fact that the likes yon-rogg and whiplash exist that says something) dar-benn has 2 goals, restore her planet's atmosphere, hydrosphere and sun after a civil war destroyed all three (and yes, they did unironically steal the plot of spaceballs) and take revenge on captain marvel for destroying the supreme intelligence and triggering said civil war. now, how does a planetary civil war cause the death of its sun? i don't know and neither does the movie. it's never made clear why these two motives are conflated, she could easily find an uninhibited planet to take the atmosphere and oceans from and probably its sun as well, then marshall her forces to go against carol danvers, trying to do both at the same time by siphoning the resources from 3 separate civilized planets that carol has ties to not only puts her in the croshairs of the god-like being that is captain marvel but also makes her an enemy to pretty much every civilization in the universe, both of which might either interfere with her plan or cause a galactic crusade against hala which could leave it worse off than it was before.her way of achieving her convoluted goals is to use a pair of bracelets called the quantum bands (which actually resemble more the comic book negabands, but i can't imagine why they wouldn't want to use that name) to manipulate the jump point system to siphon the aforementioned resources from said 3 planets. now, nonsensical motivations are not always bad (see thanos) as long as the villain is themselves are interesting, engaging and consistent, dar-benn is none of the three, the actress is simply subpar, she miserably fails to be intimidating and those metal bits in her teeth made me want to laugh every time she opened her mouth, she also has no progression in any level, her goal itself is noble, save her planet, but she tries to achieve it an triple-genocidal manner even though she doesn't have to and yet she never doubts herself nor do the atrocities she commits weigh on her in any way, her power or threat level don't fluctuate either from getting the first qb in the beginning to getting the second and blowing herself up. she's completely flat, she never progresses in power, motivation or character, she's simply ""the bad guy"" and any depth implied beyond that is an illusion that's never paid off in the script.however, as gotg proved you can have an awesome movie with an uninteresting villain as long as your heroes make up for it, in the marvels unfortunately the protagonists are anything but. to begin with the movie is very short to fully develop three different characters, and it can't rely on previous characterization because carol (despite already having a movie of her own) has very little actual character, monica rambeau is side character from a d+ show who's biggest claim to fame is excusing crimes against humanity and ms. marvel is arguably the most complete character but very few people watched her show, nevermind it was explicitly promised that no mcu movie would require d+ shows to be watched first. the performances don't really make up for the lack of actual characters, with brie larson being seemingly uninterested in the whole thing, teyonah parris being plain flat and iman vellani bringing significant energy and effort in her performance but unfortunately unable to compensate for her co-stars' failure to deliver. meanwhile, the less said about that bts guy the better.now, a lack of personal development can be circumvented if the relationships between said characters are well constructed (again, the rocket-groot relationship in gotg vol 1 comes to mind) but, you might've guessed it, there's very little of that, monica is briefly mad at carol for abandoning her and her mother even when maria had cancer, but that's quickly overcome and henceforth the movie tries its damnest to convince you that these 3 are the best of friends and even family but it falls flat. meanwhile, carol, despite her appearance, is supposed to be a woman in her 60s, she never comes across as that nor as someone who has spent the last 30 years cruising space seeing any number of incomprehensible things and correcting injustices and i simply can't see her as monica's ""aunt carol"" because they don't just look the same age they act like it too.the main ""mechanic"" of the movie is that the 3 protagonists are ""entangled"" when dar-benn first utilizes the quantum band, it's never really explained how and why but the end result is that when the 3 use their powers at the same time, they swich places. the main reason for this isn't just to bring the leads together but also to shackle captain marvel with the other two because given the power she has previously demonstrated every threat in this movie should be a walk in the park, which could be fine, after all every superman needs their kryptonite, if they didn't apply this effect selectively and then practically forgot about it altogether. additionally, none of them bring anything unique to the table, their powers function identically and they don't seem to utilize their unique skills at all, monica is a scientist who rarely employs any science and carol could be a skilled tactician and leader (finally justifying the moniker of captain) but she displays nothing of the sort.the ending is probably the worst part of the movie the final fight takes place in a small room with space as a backdrop greatly confining them and drastically reducing the scale of the conflict despite the power levels dar-benn and carol have shown before, then dar-benn takes the 2nd qb and it causes her to overload with power and explode after opening another portal. also, monica instantly just knows information (presumably because science is tantamount to clairvoyance now): she just knows dar-benn is gonna die after putting on the 2nd bracelet, even though she has shown no adverse effects even after prolonged use of the first, she just knows that carol can use her powers to revive hala's sun and survive, she just knows that the portal is a tear to the multiverse (because what would a post-endgame marvel movie be without shoe-horning in the multiverse?), she just knows her powers can close it and she just knows she has to be on the other side of it to do it. meanwhile, as monica is closing the portal, carol decides to rush in to save her from getting trapped in the other universe even though that would mean the tear stays open and their whole universe is destroyed including the person she's trying to save, which either makes her a moron or a straight-up villain.she fails and afterwards she reignites hala's sun by just flying into it and then back out with no problem whatsoever, which makes her even more overpowered than she was before, which given the lengths these same writers had to go through to tone her down so she could be part of a team seems counterproductive to any future projects involving carol. not that it's their problem given i don't expect any of them are gonna be involved in said projects or any future marvel projects.overall, the marvels is shaping up to be the biggest box-office failure in the mcu and arguably one the biggest box office bombs for a movie of its caliber and i hope instead of blaming the sag-aftra strike or ""superhero fatigue"" or whatever other excuse they have lined up, feige and marvel take a long, hard look at everything they've done post-endgame and try to change their course before they irrevocably lose all the fans that elevated the mcu into the most successful franchise in history.",2
"1715","the marvels"," starts strong, then goes off rails","svynronin",2023-11-10,"the movie starts strong as you get to know all 3 of the main characters. it helps that as they get to know each other, the audience also gets to know them better. the problem is what starts out as a good premise slowly delves into a chaotic story with plenty of plot holes. the main villain was subpar and seemed more of a device to create conflict more than an actual character with depth or substance. the teeth are distracting, and she doesn't come across as someone to be reckoned with, or to even really care about it. kamala's family gets old after a while and should have stayed home, (why were they taken to space again?) it was working until carol went to the water planet where they communicate through song. not only was this not funny, it was weird and out of place. her being the princess was a good idea, but it never really went anywhere and it brought up more questions than answers. then there was the herding of cats on a space ship. the jump the shark moment if there ever was one. did no one ask questions about this story, or were they too scared to ask? i like all three characters. all have their own unique personalities and they make a good team. they also are a good foundation for future stories. the writing on this was just terrible. it's getting to a point where marvel just pays anyone with an idea to make a movie without any editing, criticism, or work in developing an actual story. this movie was somewhat similar to the last thor movie, where it starts out well then goes off a cliff, or better jumps a shark.",6

"1723","the marvels"," better than expected","felix-bergman",2023-11-08,"after the slew of forgettable low rating marvel movies and disney+ series since endgame, and particularly after the roller coaster of mixed quality that was the ms. marvel show, i didn't have too high hopes going in to this one, but was pleasantly surprised. it could have done away with some forced cameos and some repeated scenes that does basically the same thing over and over, and instead focused a bit more on character growth and dialogue, but over all it worked well. the three leads of monica rambeuo, captain marvel and ms. marvel worked well together, it didn't feel like they were rubbing it in the audience face that it was a female lead cast, it was just a super hero movie that happened to have female leads. at 105 minutes it's on the shorter end for a marvel movie, but it means it is more dense and rarely gets stale and it doesn't overstay it's welcome, though the comic reliefs in the form of kamala's family and goose the cat/flerken could have been given slightly less screen time in my opinion. one of the biggest problems is that to fully be on track going in you have to have watched not only captain marvel and endgame, but also wandavision and ms. marvel. it's getting very hard to keep up and make sure you are caught up and remember enough before going in to each new marvel movie, but if you aren't you could be left clueless as to what is going on. over all not on par with marvels best, but a step in the right direction compared to the latest bunch on movies, a sentiment i heard echoed from several of the 50 or so people that had made it to the cinema for opening night.",7

i had quite some problems with the first captain marvel movie, specifically brie larson that came off as a quite unpleasant character and way too perfect in the context of the story. i liked her better here - the story made her not so perfect anymore and she tried to tone down her apparently innate smugness.although i wasn't very convinced by the ms. marvel tv series, i thought that iman vellani gave an engaging and somehow charming performance. her portrayal as the fangirl worked.i guess teyonah parris did alright, although i kept thinking that her character didn't really bring much to the table apart from being ""the explainer"".what did not work was the relationship between parris and larsons characters in the story....that just did not resonate.let's get to the villain. well, she had an interesting look. that's all i can say about her. her motivation is quite dumbed down and her character just felt flat all around. sad, could have been handled way better in the context of the story.visually i'd say it was better than some previous isntallments in the marvel cinematic universe. i didn't mind some cgi imperfections, it was colorful and varied.regarding the action scenes i'm torn. they are cut in manner that makes it hard to follow sometimes and nothing special, but they entertained, even though there was no emotional heft in any of them.the story is as simple as it gets, but at the same time there are so many inconsistent rules and logical flaws that at some point you just give up. the mechanic of the switching places is pretty much just a gimmick that makes barely any sense in the story. it's essentially an amusement park ride, you rush from a to b to c and you never really care why.what is good and bad at the same time is the pace. it has no lengths so it flies by fast. but it also seems to have been made for the tiktok generation, requiring virtually no attention span. this comes at the cost of character depth. but maybe it's better that way, confer above comments on the story.having sad all that, i nevertheless give this a 7. i was entertained by it. it is mindless, it is sometimes cringy but is also ok fun.",7

"1740","the marvels"," better than captain marvel, but could've been better","ajacayen-90247",2023-11-08,"it has been a while ever since i went to a theater to see a marvel movie. because of how uninterested i was, let alone how quantumania and love and thunder hindered my love for superhero movies, i have become indifferent with the mcu. fortunately, because of how cool the trailers look and the return of one of my favorite marvel heroes alongside two other characters i am unfamiliar, i am curious to see how the marvels would turn out, which is a sequel to captain marvel and ms. marvel. i would say that, for the most part, it is an enjoyable film but with major creative decisions that did not quite work with me.starting off with the positives, in my point of view, is brie larson's carol danvers aka captain marvel finally having more personality. unlike the first one where she felt too stoic and showing little to no emotions, here she was able to show off her soft side whenever she is interacting with the other two superheroes and as she tries to become a leader since she hasn't been able to manage a team yet.iman vellani as kamala khan or ms. marvel was an absolute delight to see on the big screen. even though i am aware that not a lot of people have seen her television show or may not have liked it in general, we cannot deny how much energy she brings whenever she was given the screen time. even though some of her jokes did not land, you can see how she reacts to serious situations, striving not just to get appreciation from captain marvel but becoming a real superhero.as for monica rambeau played by teyonah parris, there were moments from her that i thought she was cool whenever she was showing off her powers, especially when she is fighting together with kamala and danvers. but there are things that i felt were just unresolved or was like an emotional baggage towards carol that just didn't work for me.the rest of the cast was fine. the khan family were all adorable and supportive to look at whenever they interact with kamala, samuel jackson as nick fury is as good as always but park seo-joon felt like he was there but for no reason at all. but of course, like with almost every marvel movie, the villain always tends to be underutilized. even though zawe ashton did her best in her role as dar-benn, i wish she could have been better.speaking of ""could have been better"", the film's runtime, which is actually the shortest for an mcu film, truly affected the story. there are a lot of sequences that could have been expounded a lot more and the way the movie progressed felt too fast, like it wasn't giving enough time for fans to take in the information and just being spoon-fed a lot by rambeau. this includes how the superheroes are switching in the first place and how they are able to track down following planets.not to mention that certain scenes in the second act felt so off and just trying to be funny for the sake of it - which is one of the major reasons why the mcu is already in a decline in terms of quality. i would not give out any spoilers but let me just say that it transitioned to genres that i did not expect and it actually turned me off for a while, just waiting for it to be over and go back to saving the universe again.in conclusion, the marvels is most likely going to make people even more turned off due to the creative decisions that were made, probably from the studio as shown in several videos on youtube. but on my end, just ignoring how the franchise is being ridiculed as of this moment, i would say that the cast saved most parts of the film and in a way, was better than captain marvel and not as bad as people might expect - but could have been so much more.",6

(this summer's monster megahit barbie film quickly crossed that bollywood musical line and it never came back!)if i had any criticisms, it's that, firstly, the film far too quickly glossed over the reason why the kree race now calls captain marvel ""the annihilator"". that revelation was very crucial and is far too important a plot point to quickly gloss over. secondly, speaking of ""far too quickly"", the finale quickly devolved into a non-stop slugfest, but then again, that's just what i want out of a superhero action movie. if i'm ever in a mood for a thinkfest, that's just what films like watchmen and oppenheimer are for! does that make me an easily pleased person? yes, it does. am i ashamed of that? no, i am not! for better or for worse, i unconditionally enjoyed the marvels, warts and all, but don't take my word for it, go see it and judge it for yourself! end of soapbox sermon!",8

'the marvels' scores in its runtime as well. none of the scenes drag endlessly and there is definitely more action than talk this time.'the marvels' triumphs as a dazzling spectacle that seamlessly combines action, heart, and a stellar cast. this one breaks free from the complexity of previous storylines, delivering a refreshing and heartwarming take on superhero narratives, leaving audiences eager for more, especially after those enticing post-credit scenes.",6

"1782","the marvels"," a good fun film","alindsayal",2023-11-12,"i think most people can agree that this isn't currently the best time for the marvel cinematic universe and some of their projects haven't got the best responses. the next film to come out under this banner is the marvels and i saw it the other day and here is my review for it. the premise of the film sees captain marvel get her powers entangled with kamala khan & monica rambeau forcing them to work together in order to try and save the world.main character
ever since she was cast as captain marvel it feels like brie larson has received a bunch of unnecessary criticism and i am going to say that i thought she was really good here. it seemed that she was actually having a lot of fun here and she made carol danvers a likeable character and one that i actually cared about. she has progressed as a character and the film does a good job in making her less over powered then she has been in previous films.supporting characters
i wasn't a huge fan of the disney+ show ms marvel but i can't deny that i really enjoyed iman vellani's performance as kamala khan in this film. she is a complete fangirl here and she added so much energy to the film and was really fun as part of this larger project.teyonah parris reprises her role as monica rambeau and i thought she was very good too, she is the most serious of the three characters and the film does an okay job of showing that but parris sells it well and makes you care about how her character has been affected by other characters actions. the chemistry between these three characters is what carries this film.samuel l jackson is once again back in the role of nick fury and he is clearly having the blast. the serious character from secret invasion is gone and he is here for comedic relief and though that is a little frustrating i can't deny that it was fun watching him here.zawe ashton plays the main villain dar-benn and she does a decent job, this won't be one of the most memorable mcu villains but i thought the character was pretty well written and ashton did the best she could with the amount of screen time she had.story
the story is okay, i think it does a really good job of establishing the three characters in case you haven't seen the disney+ shows that kamala & monica are in. it establishes a bond between the three main characters and the issues that concern them, they also give the villain an interesting motivation that makes some sense. but the issue is that none of it is developed enough, it feels a bit rushed and like certain arcs aren't given enough time to shine and that holds the film back a bit.script
the script is also just okay. there is some pretty good humour and some moments of conflict that hit hard but there just isn't quite enough. it doesn't take many gambles and is quite generic which leaves it a little short.style
the film looks pretty good it avoids the cgi issues of some previous mcu films and has some fun action sequences that due to some certain story choices allows for some real creativity. it's more of a pacing issue that the film has, it takes a bit of time to get going and then seems to rush at other times which makes it a little jarring.overall
overall, the marvels is a good fun film. it will not save the mcu but it is a quick and easy fun film to go see, i think the reviews have been pretty harsh and i think it is worth a viewing especially for comic book fans.rating - 7/10.",7

for me, we may be dealing with one of the most uninteresting villains in this film, although i liked the performance of the actress who embodies this character
overall the marvels is just a good movie
do not ignore the post credit scene.",5
"1798","the marvels"," the cats stole the show","pairic",2023-11-15,"the marvels: at times the trio act like the simpsons or maybe the three stooges but supply as many laughs as both of those in their prime. well. it's all carol danvers' fault, after she destroyed rhe supreme intelligence, the kree have a civil war which ecologically wrecks their home planet hala and damages their sun (we learn this at the start). dar-benn, the new leader of the kree, retrieves one of the quantum bands, of which kamala khan (ms marvel) has the other half. dar-benn harnesses the power of the band to tear open a jump point in space. this causes damage the resulting anomaly is investigated by from separate sides by monica rambeau and carol danvers. when rambeau touches the anomaly, she, danvers, and kamala switch places through teleportation. the switching causes the three to fight each others' kree enemies. this results in some slapstick comedy scenes which also advance the narrative. how will they sort this out? nick fury is involved as well, so is the lovable cat who sprouts tentacles from his mouth and swallows the kree leader's henchmen and many kittens appear.. the skrull once again have to be rescued by the trio and danvers learns lessons about her great white saviour complex. we even get a planet where the inhabitants communicate through song, colourfully dressed like aliens from stos or early episodes of stng. some great battle scenes and one to combat, all delivers with a soupcon of humour. not the greatest of the marvel films (this is the 33rd film in the marvel cinematic universe (mcu)). but well worth watching. directed by nia dacosta, who co-wrote the screenplay with megan mcdonnell and elissa karasik. 7.5/10.",8
"1799","the marvels"," blends teamwork, girl power, comedy and emotion with action-adventure and positive themes","rannynm",2023-11-14,"while it is far from perfect, the marvels is a captivating film filled with adventure and laughter. it has unexpected twists and turns around every corner that help make it an entertaining movie.the marvels centers around members of the avengers. carol danvers (brie larson), better known as captain marvel, has found herself and her superpowers linked with monica rambeau (teyonah parris) and new teenage superhero kamala khan (iman vellani), aka miss marvel. these three powerful women must team up to stop dar-benn (zawe ashton), the ruler of a struggling civilization who has set her eyes on taking resources from thriving planets. however many secrets about carol's past resurface as they do so.iman vellani's performance as kamala khan overpowers the movie with a new side of joy to the mcu. her explosive personality bursts through the screen as a huge highlight throughout the entire film. i love her character as she brings it to life with a passion. there are so many insane plot twists throughout the film and, while most are a great addition to the plot, a few get a little too crazy for my liking; though they aren't wild enough to drag the movie down. i enjoyed the plot being based around three strong women who are in charge. it's something not seen as often in superhero movies, especially in the past, but the mcu has been doing it a lot recently and it's very empowering. my favorite part of the movie is towards the beginning when monica, kamala and carol first discover their powers have been entangled and they find themselves fighting soldiers in three different places and switching back and forth between locations throughout the battle. it's super fun to watch and my eyes were glued to the screen.the message of the marvels is that true friends and family will love you and always be there for you no matter what. carol learns this throughout the movie as she sometimes worries about what the people who care for her will think about her past; eventually, she accepts that they will love her for who she is now and not what she's done before.i give the marvels 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. it releases in theaters november 10, 2023.by kendall b., kids first!",8
"1800","the marvels"," may have earned marvel a brief stay of execution from martin scorsese","darthvoorhees",2023-11-12,"no one was more prepared to hate 'the marvels' than i was. i have vehemently agreed with every complaint and critique leveled at the mcu for years. individually i've liked and even loved some entries but as a cohesive whole the mcu has brought moviegoing to cynical cashgprabbing and story telling lows. post-'endgame' has been a real chore and with the mcu on the ropes and having hated the last four or five films i was sure there would be nothing to like in 'the marvels' when i was brought with to see it.well, i ate some humble pie. 'the marvels' is an interesting film to dissect because in truth it doesn't do much right. those mcu problems are all still there...(in fact this might be the absolute worst in being a commercial for half realized properties) and it has a horribly dull villain who is evil for the sake of evil. the drama is all contrived as well.and despite that you cannot deny that 'the marvels' has a distinct personality of its own. the worlds visited are all very unique and don't mimic the grey russo brothers look of 'captain america winter solider' that nine out of ten marvel films have in the past decade. the idea of the singing planet is very funny and shockingly irreverent for a marvel film. the sequence with the flerkens is equal parts gross and cute which is a great combination. so in a movie with a mercifully short runtime i ended up smiling a lot between some moments of groaning.but let's be honest what elevates 'the marvels' is the performance from iman vellani as kamala khan/ms. marvel. she is charming and funny and steals every scene she is in(and brie larson and teyonah parris are no slouches either). i know the bar is low but vellani injects a sense of fun and wonder into khan that is infectious especially compared to someone like mcu veteran samuel l jackson who has stretches where he seems like he is sleepwalking through the material. the true testament to how much i liked vellani's performance is that she is given a cringe sequel set-up that she is able to make genuinely hilarious despite the fact i hate sequel set ups.the titanic that is the mcu is still sinking but 'the marvels' is a banger rendition of 'nearer my god to thee.'",7
"1801","barbie"," an amazingly perfect blend of social satire & fun","zkonedog",2023-08-01,"for a film like ""barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. it needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director greta gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.for a very basic overview, ""barbie"" sees its titular character (played by margot robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in barbieland. well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to weird barbie (kate mckinnon) to figure out what is going on. as it turns out, a rift has developed between barbieland and the real world that only stereotypical barbie--accompanied by beach ken (ryan gosling)--can mend. but when barbie & ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.in terms of plot, somehow gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with ""barbie"". a mere mention of the term ""patriarchy"" in today's polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. much like, say, jordan peele before her did with horror flicks like ""get out"" or ""us"", gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. sometimes, that proves to be the best ""delivery service"" and it is certainly true in this case.of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film's shenanigans and softer moments, and ""barbie"" comes up aces in that department too. robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film's own dual nature. but more often than not it is gosling who steals the show every time he's on screen. to do what gerwig wants to do with ""barbie"", the ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of gosling (one of hollywood's most underappreciated acting talents). the rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.""barbie"" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn't short the area of pink paint for no reason. dp rodrigo pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. all of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of lizzo, dua lipa, billie eilish, and even gosling himself!not only do i feel that ""barbie"" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like ""the flash"", ""mission impossible: dead reckoning 1"", & ""oppenheimer"", but it subsequently vaulted gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside nolan, villeneuve, peele, etc.). after not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, i was utterly blown away by this experience.",10

"1804","barbie"," amazing cast & set, but the political message was too strong","fscsgxp",2023-07-20,"i've been excited for this movie for over a year. the casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! the set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. it is perfection.the first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. i'm a woman myself, and i'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. so sad.( spoilers ahead )even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. they manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the supreme court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. so they are no better than the kens in the end. how sad! isn't there a world where they can be better? include the kens and all be equals?? what are we trying to teach young girls? that feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? also, i would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..",6
"1805","barbie"," the best version of itself","masonsaul",2023-07-21,"barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. it's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.margot robbie is perfect casting as barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric barbie land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. she has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with gosling works beautifully.ryan gosling is phenomenal as ken. note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in the nice guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. it all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.will ferrell is essentially playing lord business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in barbie land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.america ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with ariana greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of barbie.greta gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a barbie land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.the soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.",10
"1806","barbie"," i would have preferred to see this as a 30 minute tv sitcom","ed-shullivan",2023-12-27,"mrs. shullivan and i enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various ken's we agreed that ryan gosling appeared to be the main character and not barbie.don't get me wrong, both ryan gosling and margot robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of ken and barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the ryan gosling ""ken doll"" with an enhanced cgi eight (8) pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for ryan gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through barbie's vision of the changing world.the visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the 1960's elvis films such as blue hawaii since barbie and elvis were popular icons within the same era. the downside of the barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male ken dolls.all in all it was a decent film, not to be considered a future film classic, nor a memorable ryan goslng or margot robbie performance worthy of an academy award but just like barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era. it would not surprise me to see a tv producer turn this barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly 30 minute tv sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold mrs. shullivan and my own attention for.i give the film a decent 6 out of 10 imdb rating.",6
"1807","barbie"," funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one","dello_",2023-07-25,"i had great expectations for the barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (greta gerwig and noah baumbach) and the stellar cast with margot robbie and ryan gosling leading the way. unfortunately i found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.starting with what i liked, the performances were great and in particular ryan gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. and the positives end here.unfortunately the negatives are much more important. sorted in a order of increasing gravity:
* some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. in particular i am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about mattel. furthermore, the mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. this is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. there are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. this is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: i found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. first of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and i don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. i want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. this is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. on the other side the barbies are perfect entities. in a certain way it seemed ""birds of prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in hollywood behind. not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. this is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. all of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. that was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.in conclusion, i was very disappointed by the ""barbie"" movie because i actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. i've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. however the great merit that i have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. and so, even if i didn't like it i'd suggest you to watch ""barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!",4

"1811","barbie"," i don't see how it was preachy","thepopcornexplorer",2023-08-04,"in this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. now everything in the movies and tv shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and tv shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.so let's start with the actual review, greta gerwig seems to have found an actual legitimate story for the type of message she delivered, contrary to most criticism i didn't find the movie preachy or biased at all, i actually felt it was incredibly balanced and the message made sense considering the plot. sometimes i do agree that these (for some reason) delicate social topics tend to be pushed into films because a lot of studio directors want to align with trends to make a few more dollars, but in this particular film i didn't felt that at all!it's a fictional story that has the ability to tell a bit of historical context of one of the most (if not the most) famous dolls in the world and how it impacted the world culture and how it actually affected women's image with its controversial decisions.the other aspect of this fictional story is providing perspective, of how women are perceived and treated in our society, the rooted systemic issues we tend to ignore and with the barbie plot device provide some fun and interesting analogy of how society would be if it was the other way around and women were the ones holding most power.but again there's no hidden dark meaning, it's just a woman's perspective and if you think about it, even though reality change a lot considering the country where you live, it's not that ridiculous, the story is ultimately about equality and its a fun innocent approach to it.margot robbie is insanely talented and its amazing to watch her portray this role, for once i am hoping that we keep the dialogue opened and stop inventing false theories .",9

my rating 6.5/10i've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because i'm a great fan of margo robbie, ryan gosling and greta gerwig's work.i held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and i'd love it or a huge disappointment and i'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.how ever that's not the case i didn't love it and i didn't loathe it i have to accept that i
just didn't get it ?perhaps it's because that i'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see barbie.the audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that i didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.no spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. barbie and ken leave the other barbies and ken's behind in barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical barbie played to perfection by margo robbie . barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by ryan gosling joins barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at venice beach california complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of barbie land are reversed in the real world . the question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?pink cloud sunny barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?margo robbie and ryan gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while i hope it's popular for the creators of the movie i'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?the male population that greta gerwig cleverly parodies through ken and his ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and i think the disney generation of under 15 would be bored .i did enjoy the technical aspects of barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.i also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like stanley kubric's 2001 a space odysee , saturday night fever, and of course the wizard of oz .it's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of warner bros then in 2019 they finally announced margot robbie and greta gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.director greta gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with noah baumbach basing their story on the famous barbie fashion dolls by mattel . it is the first live action barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .mattel, the toy company that created barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in greta gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the barbie world intact and i suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous barbie dolls get a mention in this film.noah baumbach is executive producer as well as his partner greta gerwig and margo robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million us$.margo robbie has been quoted as saying ""that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences ""the thing you didn't know you wanted.i'm not so sure about that statement as barbie didn't reach my expectations and i felt the thing i didn't know i wanted wasn't what i wanted at all.top marks to cinematographer rodrigo prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that greta gerwig named ""techni-barbie,"" after the technicolor format. also top marks to two time academy award winner designer jacqueline durran. it's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,",6

greetings again from the darkness. a reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. however, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional lady bird, 2017), greta gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. this strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.ms. gerwig co-wrote the screenplay with her real-life spouse and fellow filmmaker, noah baumbach (marriage story, 2019), and it's fascinating to see what they have produced. whether you find the film entertaining is another matter altogether, yet we tip our cap to the strange, visually-stimulating, and thought-provoking end result. many will go in-depth on analyzing the gender politics and feminist approach to the story; however, i'm just here to discuss this as a movie, not a movement.two-time oscar nominee margot robbie stuns in the opening sequence (a tribute to 2001: a space odyssey) as the original 1959 barbie. in fact, ms. robbie is terrific throughout in this more-challenging-than-expected role. she's so much more than a pretty face in high heels, as she's previously proven in a risk-taking career featuring memorable turns in such films as the wolf of wall street (2013), suicide squad (2016), i, tonya (2017), as sharon tate in once upon a time in hollywood (2019), and last year's underappreciated babylon (2022). this time she portrays 'stereotypical' barbie, whose everyday is perfect in barbieland. it's here where we meet a diverse group of barbies featuring issa rae, alexandra shipp, emma mackey, sharon rooney, dua lip, and others. we are also introduced to ken (two-time oscar nominee ryan gosling, terrific here), whose mood for the day is totally dependent on whether barbie acknowledges him. an equally diverse group of kens features simu liu, kingsley ben-adir, john cena, ncuti gatwa, and others.barbie's paradise is rocked one day when she begins wondering about death. a trip to ""weird barbie"" (a kooky kate mckinnon) lets her know that the only cure for this existential crisis is a visit to the human world, where a sad girl is playing with her doll. it's really an imaginative hook to allow the two worlds to collide. unfortunately, only bits and pieces of the human world clicked for me (loved the rollerblading at venice beach). it makes sense that barbie is shocked to discover the misogyny and patriarchy ruling the human world, but there are three other elements at play here: ken discovering that men don't take a backseat to women in this world, and in fact, they dominate; the corporate office of mattel plays like a slapstick cartoon with will ferrell as a nonsensical ceo; and the mother-daughter duo of america ferrera as gloria and ariana greenblat as sasha. the big twist occurs in that latter sequence, and it's ms. ferrera who dishes out the gut punch soliloquy about what's expected of women and how they are viewed. this monologue is the lesson director gerwig wants viewers to leave with.barbie's return to a much-changed barbieland finds ken and other kens treating the dreamhouse like a frat house. see, the boys have learned how to run things their way ... and at its core, that's my main issue with the movie's theme. empowering women is a good thing, but why did ms. gerwig feel the need to make everything either a win for the women or a win for the men? i have always thought equality was the goal, not dominance. it's this approach that gives the film a serious and dark undertone in a quite heavy-handed manner. sure women enjoy having power. so do men. that's no great mystery solved, and in fact makes these obvious points somehow more obvious.let's talk about a few other less ominous topics. helen mirren delivers an admirable voiceover as the narrator, and a depressed barbie and ken's affinity for horses are nice touches. two of my favorite segments are barbie's first interaction in the human world ... a ""beautiful"" woman on a park bench played by oscar winner ann roth (a renowned costume designer who did not handle the costumes for this film), and a conversation with barbie inventor ruth handler (played by rhea perlman), who named the doll after her daughter. while i hold firm on my belief that the film is not especially entertaining/fun, i'll also admit the song and dance around the ""i'm just ken"" number was a hoot. other than performances from margot robbie and ryan gosling, the star here is the production design from six-time oscar nominee sarah greenwood. the film looks amazing, even if you might get your fill of pink by the end. barbieland is quite a sight - it's a shame the rest of the movie didn't deliver this much fun, and instead pitted men against women.",6
"1824","barbie"," a lot of fun....","brockfal",2023-12-15,"firstly, let's just say that i am not in the ideal demographic for 'barbie', being male, 66 years old, and i don't have children, so it's taken me a while to get to this film. anyway, what a lot of fun this film is. the concept works brilliantly and it's all carried through with self effacing charm and humour that both wins you over from the start , opening wonderfully with a parody of 2001, and then keeps you engaged throughout. margot robbie is perfect in the lead and ryan gossling couldn't be better as ken (or one of the many ken's), and the whole thing chugs along effortlessly and humorously. the idea of the conflict between the wonderfully created female world of barbieland and the male dominated real world is milked for all it can give, with director greta gerwig hardly missing a trick. on so many levels this is a clever and tremendously entertaining film and i really loved it - even an old guy like me....",8

"1827","barbie"," a sheer pleasure to watch.","adamjohns-42575",2023-08-10,"barbie (2023) -*i wrote this review about three times and i'm afraid it's still a bit of a ramble.i didn't go in to watching this expecting it to amaze me, but to only provide a few basic giggles. i suppose i'd thought that it would be too juvenile and aimed at teens and tweens, but actually it was very good and the more i recalled of it, the more i wanted to see it again.there was so much nostalgia throughout this film, even for me as a gay man, who as a child learned that he needed to catch his sister in a good mood if he wanted to play barbie with her and ultimately ended up playing with his 'star wars' figures a lot instead.the little touches and the interesting special editions of the doll that popped up throughout were cleverly used and some of them easy to remember from trips to the toy shop and the times that i used to sneak in to my sisters room to play with her collection whilst she was out.add to that a great deal of humour in various styles and it would be hard for even the most masculine, anti-feminist not to find something to laugh at in this film, despite the fact that it took the mick out of men in general.yes it did make a point of empowering women of all backgrounds, which it was always going to do, but i felt that it did it without making such a harsh attack on men that the average male would feel threatened by it or take the jokes with anything but a pinch of salt and there is always the hope that some people would learn from it.essentially it was just parodying the way that women have been treated over the years and showing that treatment up for the stupid behaviour that it was and sadly still is by exploring how a matriarchy might effect men and the ways that they might react.the general production of the film came across like a cross between 'elf' (2003), 'the lego movie' (2014), 'big' (1988) and so many others of that oeuvre.all of it, but specifically barbieland was brilliantly designed and constructed, colourful and fun, with a great soundtrack and some real laugh out loud moments, a lot of which were quite adult. and while the majority of those jokes might go over the heads of a younger audience, i could see why it was given a 12 rating. the adventure had an emotional depth that might not grip younger kids.with regards to the cast, margot robbie was great in her role of stereotypical barbie. i loved the scene where ""ugly betty"" (america ferrera as gloria) was applying margot's make up as it seemed so ironic, but i'm afraid that barb's leading man ken really stole the limelight, especially with his song ""i'm just ken"", which has featured very heavily on my itunes lately.ryan gosling was superb as the plasticised blonde and blue eyed man, although at times i wasn't sure whether his toned abs might not actually be a plastic prosthetic, because they weren't totally natural looking.however, i think that i've found a new appreciation for ryan after the disaster that was 'la la land' (2016), because he was just so good in this role. it was another irony that he stood out so much in a film about barbie, which repeatedly referred to ken as just an accessory.i also loved rhea perlman in her casting. the usually brassy little lady seemed perfect in her role and i thought that she could have performed helen mirren's narrator part as well, because, for the amount helen actually said, it didn't really need another celebrity and rhea's character would have leant itself to the voiceover easily.""weird"" barbie, the doll who was played with too much, performed by kate mckinnon was fantastic and an absolutely great addition to the story.i also liked michael cera's character allan, it wasn't anything very new for him, but delivered a different kind of comic relief with his subtlety and non presence.i did however feel that will ferrell had some typical ferrell moments that were a bit daft and could have been left out, but in the end even he was appropriate in his part of the ditsy mattel ceo as well.there really was an amalgamation of comedic stylings, which i felt would make it appealing to almost anyone.i'm not sure that i caught all of the cameos dotted throughout, but there were some definite surprises and i looked forward to trying to spot them all when i saw it again.i did notice that there was a lot of british actors among the cast though. at least three of them were from the tv series 'sex education' (2019-23).not that i'm saying that all those brits were a bad thing, but it was odd that they were mostly playing americans. i would assume that a lot of it was filmed in the uk, making it easier to use them.ultimately i enjoyed the inclusion of all of the british cast, 3 of whom that i've had the pleasure to work with myself.i specifically liked connor swindells as aaron dinkins. after his roles in 'sex education' and 'sas: rogue heroes' (2022-) i felt that this was yet another example of his diversity.and on the topic of diversity, i really appreciated that people from all walks of life were represented in the film, but not made a fuss of or shoved in my face to prove a point that the film and barbieland was an educated place. i spotted the wheelchair barbie amongst the rest, but they didn't include her in the story just to tick a box and i was glad of that, because i'm tired of films trying too hard to be politically correct and compromising the end result to achieve it. that doesn't mean that i wouldn't have been happy to see her play a key role if it had been relevant to the story of course.on my second viewing of this one i felt that there was also a more subtle message about not taking people for granted and another about the fact that you can't stop things from changing. i think it was those ideas that mellowed out the overall strong female empowerment and equal rights message that rightly seemed to be the primary element of the film, because you couldn't help but feel for ken, whilst also empathising with barbie.i also remembered that i had thought the end montage to be somewhat lacking in power and i think that was due to the clarity and rush of the images that went by. i would have liked it to have been a bit brighter and certainly visually clearer.as a whole though it was a real pleasure to watch and left me with a smile on my face. i'm pretty sure that i will end up with it on dvd, because it was one of those films that will always make me feel a joy to watch, which i believe the world needs more of.838.49/1000.",8

"1829","barbie"," how is this movie so popular?","tommy-97761",2023-09-13,"i realise that i am hardly the target audience of this movie, but even so, slogging trough the movie i am baffled as to what the appeal is? there must be something with all the money it made at the box office, right? i haven't read any other reviews yet so as not to spoil my own impression of the movie.i've waited for the home release and i will admit, i fell asleep a couple times and am not compelled at all to rewatch the movie any time soon.there are some visual gags and some good jokes but i felt like those kind of ran out in the first 20 minutes or so. once you get pass the novelty of the movie, what else is there? not much in my opinion. the only thing that could hold my interest was ken and his subplot, but the things happening around and to barbie i couldn't care less about. the movie didn't make me care at all about anything that happened and as such left me bored and looking at my watch. the ending scene i pretty much fast forwarded. if there was supposed to be any kind of emotional response, i detected none. is i said, sure, i am not the target audience but the movie being so successful i expected at least something other than boredom. my only emotional response i guess is sadness, because of the inevitable copycats and sequels that will try and leech of the success of barbie, which isn't any good in the first place.edit: in hindsight i reviewed my rating and gave a bit more, because days later stuff like the mojo dojo casa house, or i'm just ken just stuck with me more than i like to admit so there are memorable things and as i said, the opening of the movie is indeed fun. i still think they ran out of ideas and weren't sure how to end things and as such would be weary of a sequel given that there weren't enough ideas for a single movie imo.",5

"1831","barbie"," the ken stuff goes on way too long","thalassafischer",2024-01-18,"the weirdest thing about barbie is that greta gerwig couldn't even do barbie without making such a huge deference to ken. i get that she was trying to make a statement about how women feel by using the ken's as an ""opposite mirror"" to try to get men to understand patriarchy. i do get that. but aren't there multiple speeches about how taking care of men and fixing them isn't women's job?good lord there was a point where ryan gosling's pity-party singing just gets on my nerves and i almost wanted to turn this flick off. i told myself that at some point barbie would stop being a bad musical and turn back into a funny film with some adult commentary about gender roles in society.",6
"1832","barbie"," this movie tries to be too much","brianjohnson-20043",2023-07-24,"i wanted to like it. but i just didn't. the story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. the story itself should nearly always be more important.all of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. and the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. but i rarely laughed. and that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. there also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.i also found it annoying to see will farrell play a similar part to what he played in the lego movie. sure he's a ceo rather than a dad. but he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. it just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first lego movie provided to its audience.i'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.i also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. there was barbie, ken, many other barbies, many other kens, the crazy barbie, the ceos, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. and it's not just that they had all of these characters. they also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. i felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. and obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the barbie world.honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the easter egg stuff about odd barbie products over the years. and easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. they should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.",4
"1833","barbie"," surprisingly good","jeremy_urquhart",2023-07-23,"i think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action barbie movie could ever be, with greta gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. it's bigger in scale than her previous two films (ladybird and little women, both of which i prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. it's very funny in parts, and though i guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""what's a fascist?"" is something i heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.margot robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. it is barbie's movie, but ryan gosling's ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). i don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. i also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way i imagine some people will read into it. barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but ken goes through one too, and i thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.it's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, i don't think all did. it does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but i did expect that. and it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this.",8

"1839","barbie"," a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes","fredrikgunerius",2023-08-01,"the big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of barbie, mattel's historic toy doll. unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. that a movie about barbie would be guilty of americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - barbie also views everything through the eyes of hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer greta gervig (lady bird, little women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. the filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. alas, barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. there are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of barbie and ken's days in barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.",5

"1856","barbie"," life is plastic!","kelboy10",2023-08-06,"firstly, let's start with what was good about barbie and move forward from there. the colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. what it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. in the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.this silly satire soon finds itself covering too much ground about how the world of barbie is female dominant, alongside how the real world is male dominant. it evolves into a feminist movement film that is a little dated, then slowly back peddles and suggests everyone should be who they want to be. that all you have to do is find out who you are and what your purpose is. it almost becomes lost within its own thought pattern without really conveying anything meaningful. it feels like a load of thoughts with no conclusion or that somebody has thrown a pad of post-it notes in the air. the musical tone and lighthearted comedy that seemed set to propel this movie into box office glory, felt neglected to some extent, when real world themes were contemplated. what was working at first will slowly devour with over dramatic speeches of everything that is wrong with a male dominated world. as well as other complaints about having so much on your plate and being too god damn tired.barbie finds herself wanting to leave barbieland to feel real emotions rather than go through day to day life like everything is perfect. the cross-over between worlds worked to some degree, to me it was showing the girl leaving behind her dolls and becoming a woman to join the sometimes scary, but real world. (margot robbie) portrays barbie very simplistic, her approach works as that seems to be what greta gerwig aimed to show. greta gerwig differentiates the worlds developing both barbie and ken as they learn from their experience interacting with the real world. there appeared to be references to the matrix to me as barbie is given a choice between staying in barbie world or going to the real world to discover what's causing her malfunctions. also the owner ruth marianna handler gives off an oracle vibe in the scene where she offers barbie tea. one little girl blames barbie claiming she set women back decades making them stereotypical girly girls without a purpose except looking pretty putting clothes on and off and doing house chores.(ryan gosling) gives ken a lot of charisma and is purposely obnoxious at times creating an antagonist for barbie. the ken's are portrayed as weak little love puppies in barbie world without a purpose juxtaposed with how women are received in the real world. gosling reminds me of a wrestling villain that the crowd are wanting to hate on, he is a little over the top as he is turned against his fellow ken's by barbie manipulation. the poor performance of gosling attempting to cry towards the climax added to the later half of the movie losing it way. it all becomes a little too silly leaving the audience flabbergasted at what absurdity they just witnessed.",6

"1859","barbie"," preach preach preach","maskedminty",2023-07-21,"let me start by saying that i'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. i believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. but damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. it's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. the movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then barbie and ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. this movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but multiple times. these characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! the chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, you cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. barbie should have understood how kens had been feeling in the barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). yet what do they do? they manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (i guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)
i can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: people are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. the only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and margot robbie and ryan gosling have acted very well. besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and i would have respected the creators more. pass.",5

"1868","barbie"," its just barbie and ken","olcare",2023-08-11,"there's so much to say about the movie, so many points to touch on that i don't know how to express it correctly.let me start by discussing a few parts that i really liked. first of all, ryan gosling's performance was amazing; it overshadowed everything in the film. a masterful and remarkable performance. while not margot robbie's best performance, she did quite well too. i didn't find the other actors or actresses quite as impressive.another aspect i found impressive was the costumes; in my opinion, the film definitely deserved an oscar for them. they were the best costumes i've seen in a long time. similarly, the color coordination was superb.i also enjoyed the production; most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint. the comedy in the film was of good quality, and there were scenes that i really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watching.now, moving on to the things i didn't like, and the area i'd like to emphasize the most - the screenplay. after watching a strong first half, i became very invested in the movie, but the ending suffocated me. trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless. the film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half; there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner. i understood the message, but i ended up leaving the theater feeling frustrated.in addition, there's a part i absolutely disliked: barbie's convincing kens with their beauty and then reclaiming barbie land. it felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie. it definitely could have been written more cleverly. moreover, the metaphorical scene of classic barbie talking to the creator (metaphorically) and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed. it was emotional, yes, but personally, it felt heavy.in short, summing up the technical aspects and acting, the film scored a 6.5 to 7 from me. however, the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed. women are our treasures; we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other. let's love one another, let's love our women - they are our mothers. they are all invaluable, and so are we. hopefully, one day everyone will be equal, just like barbie's aim, and you can achieve your goals just like ken does.note: regardless of everything, people should stop comparing barbie and oppenheimer ; barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign, and it's necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts.",7

"1872","barbie"," ""barbie"" is fun and visually beautiful, but unfortunately barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy","fernandoschiavi",2023-07-22,"despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by greta gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clich√©s. the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to margot robbie herself as a producer. ""barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. and the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. debauchery is the great ally of gerwig and baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. it won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did mattel let this film see the light of day?"" laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.in the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the barbie universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. in these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by rodrigo prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: a space odyssey. here, we'll catch glimpses of ""the wizard of oz"" and ""the truman show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of jacques demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of gene kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of the little red shoes and all that jazz... it's a lot. ""barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.but, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, greta gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. the production is very much in line with a famous quentin tarantino interview in 2021 given to bill maher on his hbo broadcast ""real time"" in which he said: ""ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. the film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.the film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if warner, mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). greta gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""stereotyped"" barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character sasha, played by ariana greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).the truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in hollywood today. to resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is barbie (we even have a barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). the men in barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. ken is just an accessory. when barbie and ken come into the real world, everything changes. ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. barbie finds unbridled machismo (if barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). romance between barbie and ken? not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. ken even rejects the doll at one point.ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. we also have the passage of the protagonist gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.all male clich√©s are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). here, the barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the kens in a kind of macho dystopia. everything ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (stallone, godfather, horses, zack snyder, etc.). barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". for the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. the unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). at the end of the plot, gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. kens are beaten because they are ""d*mb"". the barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective ken jealous with another ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (after all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? a basic and inexplicable plot hole here).""barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. sasha and gloria are the main latin characters here and the barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. the detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by margot robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and ryan gosling (hilarious as ever). the musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.""barbie"" talks about choices and changes. in the hands of greta gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of barbie in front of ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. the work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action barbie, that is undeniable. the problem is that, in the end, barbie doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. ""who is barbie?""",5
"1873","barbie"," everyone watch this","kimberlyely-27550",2023-07-25,"barbiedid you grow up playing with barbie's? if so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of barbie. some people think barbie's are harmful to children. other people love barbie. this new movie called, barbie, explores why barbie could be problematic. greta gerwig is the director, previously she directed little women. it stars margot robbie from birds of prey and suicide squad, ryan gosling from the notebook and la la land, michael cera from arrested development, helen mirren, and rhea perlman.in 1959, ruth handler, the co-founder of the mattel toy company, created barbie. she wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. this thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. the movie will show you that handler's idea that barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. barbie (margot robbie) and ken (ryan gosling) live in barbie land, where women are in charge. barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first barbie is very carefree in barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. when she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. not only is gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. ken has always felt left out of barbie land, until he travels to the real world with barbie. unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. he finds out men are in charge, and wants that for barbie land. what his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. alan (michael cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. he has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. meanwhile, ken and barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.the dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. the cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of barbie land. robbie's role as barbie was much different than when she played harley quinn. barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while harley quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. these roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.there is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. mattel hoped that barbie would be an inspiration for women. unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. along with that, the company, mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. years after barbie was made, handler was found guilty of tax evasion.barbie shows one of the reasons the wga (writers guild of america) and sag (screen actors guild) are striking. they all want better pay, meanwhile the top ceo's of company's make millions a year. however, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. i would encourage everyone to go see this movie. it was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.",10

"1876","barbie"," great if not ham-fisted message but a sloppy movie.","dmmart-28624",2023-07-23,"i was pretty excited to see this film and hope i'm not going to get put on a list for saying i didn't enjoy it that much. the message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. barbieland is the opposite of real world where barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. however, the ending just puts barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which i hope is our goal. the movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. you could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. they wanted ken to take the patriarchy back to barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. it's all payoff and no buildup. good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. i think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.",6
"1877","barbie"," mind blowing","tforbes-2",2023-08-01,"barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way! i was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since i have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.and what we have is a combination of the twilight zone and 1971's willy wonka and the chocolate factory.it really focuses in on one barbie (margot robbie) who finds herself out of her element, and her struggle to comes to terms with herself. though the film has some weirdness to it, it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shines.and its messages pack a wallop!!!the casting is top notch, starting with ms. robbie in the title role. ryan gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well, with a wide range. but one actress truly deserves a best supporting actress oscar, and that is america ferrara. the other performers are likewise great!i'm also struck by how mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isn't always flattering. and toward the end, we have the barbie doll's creator, ruth handler (rhea perlman) tell ms. robbie's character some facts about herself that are less than flattering. that scene alone is incredibly powerful.and of course, the visuals are something to behold!on the whole, a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality! highly recommended!",10

"1879","barbie"," not written well enough","jfgibson73",2023-09-25,"i thought the storyline of this movie was not well structured. the first act was mostly fun with some genuine humor. we see barbie living in a world that looks like the toys brought to life. when she decides to go to the ""real world,"" it disrupts life for the residents of toyland. we also learn that many girls resent barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females. then, the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the barbie world and treating the women poorly. so now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself. it gets very muddled and isn't much fun at this point. i thought they should have kept it simple, because they seemed to be on the right track early on.",4

(beached off wasn't funny, but after that, the laughs started coming in). (4th wall ugly joke, margot is the wrong example for this, was the biggest laugh in the theatre )8. so to summarise, i really liked the beach battle, the dance scenes, the plotline, the comedy, the tone, the aesthetics and the atmosphere in that theatre whilst watching this thing.from what i watched, it was well put together, well excecuted and everything came together so well. and that cherry on top quip üçíüéÇ from margot robbie was just üëåoverall, if you have problems with the some of the messaging, you will not enjoy it, bottom line.

""stereotypical"" barbie (margot robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend ken (ryan gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. ken seeks a closer relationship, but barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. barbie holds one of her regular parties at her dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. the following day, barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. her friends, including writer barbie (alexandra shipp), physicist barbie (emma mackey) and lawyer barbie (sharon rooney) tell her to visit weird barbie (kate mckinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. weird barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. weird barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of the matrix). driving her pink convertible outside of barbieland, barbie finds ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. barbie and ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at venice beach, los angeles, california. the two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. at toy manufacturer mattel, the creators of barbie, the all-male board members are informed that barbie has entered the real world. the ceo (will ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. at the local school, barbie encounters a tween girl named sasha (ariana greenblatt) who criticises barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. meanwhile, ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. it is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to barbieland. feeling distraught by sasha's comments, barbie soon meets sasha's mother gloria (ugly betty's america ferrera), a mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with sasha's old barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to barbie. soon, mattel agents arrive and take barbie to headquarters. they attempt to put barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with gloria and sasha's help. during the pursuit, barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (rhea perlman) who recognises her. returning to barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. the kens have taken over, while barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. barbie tries to convince ken and the barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. barbie becomes depressed and returns to weird barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and barbie's self-confidence is restored. meanwhile, the ceo and board members are making their way to barbieland. with the assistance of sasha, weird barbie, ken's friend allan (michael cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, gloria repeats her moving words to all barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. ken intends to cement the changes to barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become president and replace all other roles taken by the women. the restored barbies manipulate the kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. the barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of barbieland's previous societal system. they decide to make changes, including better treatment for the kens and all outcast dolls. barbie and ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without barbie, she encourages him to find himself. barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. she suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of mattel co-founder ruth handler. ruth explains that she created barbie as a toy that represented what girls ""wanted to be""; she named ""barbie"" after her daughter barbara. after a montage of home footage of young girls playing, ruth explains that barbie's story has no set ending. after the barbies, kens, and mattel executives bid barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. sometime later, gloria, her husband (ryan piers williams), and sasha take barbie, now going by the name ""barbara handler"", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. also starring issa rae as president barbie, hari nef as dr. barbie, shang-chi's simu liu as tourist ken, kingsley ben-adir as basketball ken, sex education's ncuti gatwa as artist ken, jamie demetriou as mattel cfo, scott evans as stereotypical ken, ana cruz kayne as judge barbie, ritu arya as journalist barbie, derry girls' nicola coughlan as diplomat barbie, dua lipa as the mermaid barbies, john cena as ken merman, asim chaudhry as warehouse employee, ray fearon as dan at the fbi, erica ford as skipper, emerald fennell as midge, lucy boynton as proust barbie, rob brydon as sugar daddy ken, and costume designer ann roth as the woman on the bench. robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable ""stereotypical"" barbie going on an adventure, gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking ken is splendid, mckinnon is hilarious as the mangled weird barbie, ferrera is good support, ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner noah baumbach (frances ha, marriage story) were given full creative freedom for the script. they are unafraid to poke fun at the barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. the visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (""pink"" by lizzo, ""dance the night"" by dua lipa) (the original ""barbie girl"" by aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by nicki minaj and ice spice with aqua) and fun song and dance routines. it could have been a conventional girly barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. very good!",7

"1909","barbie"," way too preachy","gianthaole",2023-07-23,"my wife and i did the double feature of barbie and oppenheimer. barbie started off strong and ryan gosling is very funny in the movie. the problem is none of the barbies are in a comedy. this movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. it maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. so who is the target audience? who are the preachy moments for? if you are thinking of watching something this month, choose sound of freedom or mission impossible.",4
"1910","barbie"," a lot of fun and surprisingly funny","hjalsayegh",2023-08-10,"the movie is surprisingly well written. yes it is a fluff piece, it's called barbie after all, but for what it was a lot of thought went into all the little details.fun both in barbieland and the real world, the jokes were surprising as quite a few of them were at mattel's expense.it tackles real world issues but in a fun and light hearted way. it is however 100% targeted at women, i'd say middle aged since that was the majority of the theater and the topics not really suitable for young girls.i do wonder if it was a bit harsh on men as it did lean way too much into he vs she debate in the second half.margot robbie was amazing as barbie but ryan gosling very much stole the show. he owned every second of his screen time.",8
"1911","barbie"," lots of plastic but not fantastic","jamesrupert2014",2024-01-07,"plagued by strange un-barbie-like thoughts, barbie (margot robbie) leaves 'barbielend' for the 'realworld' (along with tag-along ken (ryan gosling)) where she (as a doll) has been rejected by a child, only to discover that the male-dominated realworld is not to her tastes. the film has some fun moments (especially in the first third) and fabulous imagery but the social-messaging was a bit heavy-handed and i quickly lost interest in the story, especially during the interminable and unmemorable song-and dance numbers. anyone interested in a parody of 'mattel's barbie' would be better served watching 'lisa vs. malibu stacy' (simpsons s.5, ep.14), which is much more clever, funnier, and a lot shorter. evidence that 'barbie' has not shamed me out of my gynophilic mindset: i rated the movie an extra star simply because margot robbie is soooo pretty.",6
"1912","barbie"," didn't meet my expectations","olelmao",2023-07-21,"i wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(it was nothing that hasn't been done before. it didn't really say anything. i hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. we understand, the patriarchy is bad. but i didn't go to this movie to be preached to.i was hoping it would be a bit more camp. i was expecting it to be like the barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. this was far from that.the ending was also a bit dragged out. it was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.i didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see raquelle or any of barbie's sisters apart from skipper.apart from the criticism, i thought the costume design was really well executed. margot robbie looked fabulous at all times.",4
"1913","barbie"," we're all dolls","klastaitas",2023-07-28,"without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would barbie find herself?and more importantly where would we find ourselves?in a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), greta gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.barbie is perfect. until she's not. and she's becomes accustomed to our culture. the perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. this is the story and it is told brilliantly.there is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. the set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to greta gerwigs skill as a director.to view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. this is what the movie displays. go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. a message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.we are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. it is amazing to see greta gerwig and noah baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. the comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.the soundtrack is astounding and in particular billie eilish's song ""what was i made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that barbie and ken have been through.a brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on youtube.",8
"1914","barbie"," a lot like the lego movie - except for the 2nd half","vic_max",2023-07-29,"as a guy who never played with barbie dolls, i was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; i purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.it's amazing to think that, a few years back, amy schumer was going to star in the title role. though after seeing margot robbie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.anyway ... like most moviegoers - i enjoyed this movie. it's a lot like the lego movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. the ""2001 a space odyssey"" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.however unlike the lego movie i can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. the first half was energized by all the barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the ""real world"".but unlike the lego movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn't able to keep the momentum going. while there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.the message was good: you don't have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. however, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.the empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. it almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.but - don';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! there's a lot to like and it's kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the barbie-love that spans generations. enjoy this experience with a big audience and you'll be glad you did.",7
"1915","barbie"," a triumph","pedropires90",2023-07-20,"i appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of greta gerwig's first two films. i knew absolutely nothing about barbie except that it was a doll. the trailers didn't impress me. i slept less than an hour last night. i watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the wb logo appeared in pink.the conditions were set for this to go wrong, but gerwig's vision for barbie won me over. the film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny barbie land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where i felt some issues, mainly with the mattel executives' characters. let's say it was the only time i felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. the third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. margot robbie is great in the role of barbie, but there's a big surprise in america ferrera, and ryan gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. all the supporting cast is hilarious.younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. however, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. the feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. it's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.",8
"1916","barbie"," cute but shallow","steveinadelaide",2023-07-24,"so i headed to the cinema to watch barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. i had high hopes. unfortunately, it fell short. barbie takes us on a journey, with margot robbie portraying ""stereotypical"" barbie as she leaves her world of barbieland and enters the real world. she encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. the plot feels predictable and filled with clich√©s, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. the acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in barbieland but not in the real world).nevertheless, greta gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; mark ronson and andrew wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; rodrigo prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. the movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the real world. the animation breathes life into barbie's world on screen. amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from ken (played by ryan gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by barbie.i had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. throughout the story, barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. however, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.barbie isn't a masterpiece. it's not a disaster, either. it's an entertaining film for kids and adults. the movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. it doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. it left me feeling amused and bored.cute but shallow.",6

"1919","barbie"," barbie, swing and a miss","michelle-kissler",2023-07-21,"this film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. however, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler barbie's heels.the script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including stem-based jobs. she helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. playing with barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional barbie doll. instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. the friendships between the barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. there's a monologue by america ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. i thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.in the spirit of equality, i also had high hopes this film would promote barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). it didn't go there at all.one aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of barbie and ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. it was evident that barbie did not reciprocate ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. the movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. ken, was extremely co-dependent and barbie just saw him as an accessory. yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.in terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. additionally, the ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. it came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.additionally, barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. it would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. sure she's 'ordinary real-world' barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. the story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.overall, i had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.",5

'i'm just ken' sequence is boring, and how barbies solve the problem is super easy and simple because it's in barbieland. i feel even defeated how gender inequality is treated this lightly and carefreelysoundtrack is the best quality. billie eilish's song at the end almost saves the film. four-minute song captures more essence and core of 'barbie' than the film itself.",7

"1924","barbie"," not a film that will hold up (and not because of its politics)","atleverton",2024-01-07,"this movie falls apart with any sort of critical evaluation. there are good and funny moments of the film, but i don't think the film is going to hold up in the coming years. it claims to be an examination of feminism through the eyes of this doll. the dolls think that they have solved the problems of the real world by their existence, a trip to the real world makes it clear that this is not the case. the kens, who are an underclass in the fantasy world, stage a rebellion and take it over. the rebellion is put down and everything returns to the status quo. and the status quo is not gender equality, it's a ruling class and a subservient class. stripping the ideology away from the film, the story of how this universe works doesn't make any sense. the dolls are the way they are because of the way that children are playing with them. so if there is sort of a matriarchal utopia, it's because little girls and little boys who are playing with the dolls have created it. so the ending of the film doesn't make any sense because the barbies say that they don't want to return to the status quo and the kens are learning about the real me. but they're not real. they're dolls, and their realities are determined for them. that's not the only weird part about the movie, there's the scene where the creator of the barbie holds hands with barbie and shows her all the feelings of a woman so that she can decide if she wants to be real or not. but in that montage, are no scenes of pain and suffering. so this barbie becomes a real person and is set up for a life of horrible suffering because she does not understand the reality of pain. she hasn't even had a stomach ache before, or even digested food before, and now she's going to be a real woman? i don't mind films having ideologies, but i think the way filmmaking is going is not a direction in which i can follow. apart from superhero movies, which people finally seem to be tired of, modern movie making is more about the feeling of a story, than the story. and i think there are a lot of problems with traditional storytelling and films, like the fact there are never unhappy endings in hollywood blockbusters. but the structure of storytelling is one which gives satisfaction to the viewer because they can feel the process of the story coming together, and if there's no actual story where is the satisfaction for the viewer?",6
"1925","barbie"," barbie is the film we need right now","parksiet",2023-07-26,"i say this without a shred of irony; greta gerwig's barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. this is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. plus, the movie is pure joy! it's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. this is the most fun i've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.this movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just so good! like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! genuinely, it's the most fun i've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! i had a freaking blast with the movie - i loved everything it did! it's pretty much the funnest movie ever!as i write this review and reflect on the film, i had the sudden urge to revisit greta gerwig's breakout directorial effort; lady bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice gerwig has as a filmmaker. having seen her take on little women and now barbie, i can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! i'm super impressed with gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. the film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. because of her ability to do lots of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. she has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of spielberg. she's easily one of the greatest of her generation. i also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. she blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! plus, gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. i've become a huge fan of gerwig's work and barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!greta gerwig's work in barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. if the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. it all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. what could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. no one could make this movie like her. she is the movie.the secret weapon of barbie is that magic ability gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. the commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! i just absolutely love that in a given scene i could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that i did. scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! my god greta gerwig is a master! even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! i loved it! it was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; i loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! and the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! you can really tell gerwig and noah baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and i'm amazed mattel and warner bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!though barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where greta gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (you'll know it when you see it.) i think scenes like this show that, while barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. and no one is excluded from that. (men, i'm looking at you.)i know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. but trust me, i'm a guy, and i loved it. i connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. this movie is for everyone. sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. this movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! trust me, go in with an open mind and i promise you won't be disappointed.the film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! the screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. it's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! and really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. it's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. it's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. it's a breakdown of barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? greta gerwig almost did too good of a job for mattel! i can't believe mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and barbie at times. it's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!and oh my god! america ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since i saw the film. it's one of the most profound pieces of writing i've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. it's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. and i can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - i know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! america ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. no one can write a monologue like greta gerwig!as i said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and i wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as i think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:""barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.or, maybe there's another way. maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.",10

(so unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant midge so looked down on, even now?and since the ending sees mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)if the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized barbie, i'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. and if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.at any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start)

(it's actually half female.)the high point of the movie comes in the opening minutes. i fell in love with that spot-on ""2001"" parody, even though it feels like an inspired afterthought.

"1950","barbie"," overrated","staronthetopofthesky",2023-09-09,"this movie is a cinematic catastrophe that leaves viewers questioning the very fabric of reality. this film takes a seemingly interesting concept and turns it into an excruciatingly tiresome and overhyped ordeal that i wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.first and foremost, the titular character, barbie, is an annoying and grating presence from the moment she graces the screen. her incessant whining, exaggerated emotions, and dramatic outbursts quickly wear out their welcome. it's like watching a never-ending loop of a soap opera with no redeeming qualities. barbie's character is not only unrelatable but also unbearable, making it impossible to invest any emotional connection with her.the premise of a doll coming to life and entering the real world could have been intriguing, but it's executed with such carelessness and lack of creativity that it falls flat. instead of exploring the endless possibilities of this concept, the movie opts for mind-numbing clich√©s and uninspired gags. it's as if the writers couldn't be bothered to put any effort into crafting a compelling narrative.the film's overhyped marketing and anticipation only serve to underscore its crushing disappointment. it's as if the marketing team desperately tried to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and the result is a movie that leaves you wondering if you could have spent those precious hours doing something more worthwhile, this movie is a regrettable waste of time and money. its annoying and one-dimensional protagonist, coupled with a lackluster plot and sluggish pacing, make it a forgettable cinematic experience. i strongly advise against watching this film and suggest looking elsewhere for more fulfilling and entertaining movie options.",1

"1953","barbie"," hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn't meant to entertain","surecommanot",2023-07-25,"in one sense, this film was more inevitable than thanos. what do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? barbie and ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" but their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. so how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? i would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only american ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that barbie has played along the way. i get the sense that the writers here just know barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. there was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.off-screen, apparently ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and barbie had some realizations about how she treated ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. hugely missed opportunities there.bottom line: as fantastic as robbie and gosling were, i wish this movie just didn't exist. keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.",3

"1955","barbie"," awkward, brilliant, anti-popcorn movie","grinningelvis",2023-07-27,"the most surprising thing about barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. it's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. the jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.as it plays out, the first half of barbie is surprisingly drab. it's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. it's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.but then, something interesting happens: barbie actually starts landing some punches. it's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by rhea perlman. and perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. she's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. in barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the corporate barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.these are the topics that have long churned in noah baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. barbie feels like ladybird by way of the life aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (oppenheimer, of oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. the film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.it's a magical thing to see margot robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. robbie, like charlize theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. it's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. it's a joke robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star ryan gosling owns.i like watching actors having fun onscreen. i actually never expected to experience this in barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for will farrell and kate mckinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. farrell and mckinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. both fall flat. we've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. their roles feel tired after countless toy storys and lego movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. they almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that mckinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. but robbie and america ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from gerwig's best instincts. there are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. to get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. at just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of barbie's angst. in that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where gerwig has taken the audience. if it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.",7

sound familiar kept wives? trophy wives you have no other purpose except to look incredible for your stupid rich husband. that was ken.the second she went into the real world. she was cat called had her ass slapped, got arrested for defending herself, and was treated with pretty privilege at the police station all while being treated like a blonde bimbo by people in the street. the complete opposite of barbieland.i hope that people can take away from barbie and ken how the roles were reversed when they went from barbieland to the real world and you could see barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.the teen angst was a good part too. barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. she has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and barbieland totally emphasizes that.even the biggest barbie was well done up. dresses well hair done speaks delicately.everyone there was picture perfect. dainty and feminine. even the supreme court were beauty pageant champions.this movie is actually deeper than i thought it would be. it was really good i really like margot robbie i think she's absolutely adorable as barbie and i felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box.",10

'i am just ken' is still stuck on my mind, as i am penning down this review. however, i do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.in conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.",9

"1989","barbie"," sly and litely amusing","gortx",2023-08-11,"greta gerwig's mildly sly take on the doll myth works more on the margins than directly. here, a ""stereotypical barbie"" (margot robbie) and a seemingly stock ken (ryan gosling), end up questioning the standard barbie myth.of course, when it's a $150m feature (with an equal amount for advertising) based on a mega-brand toy, one can't expect a truly subversive film. gerwig and co-writer noah baumbach mostly settle for some gentle barbs and lots of winks and nods right from the pre-credits sequence. the screenplay takes elements of toy story/lego movie, stepford wives/don't worry darling/get out and the pinocchio legend to tell it's tale. most of the funnier bits are the asides.the most enjoyable aspect here is the candy-colored barbie-land designed by sarah greenwood, outfitted by jacqueline durran and photographed by rodrigo prieto. the assortment of other barbies and kens including alexandra shipp, kate mckinnon, issa rae along with simu liu, kingsley ben-adir, john cena and more also bring wide-eyed joy to their roles. michael cena is amusing as the non-ken, allan.less successful is the ""real world"" with the exception of america ferrera and ariana greenblatt as a mother and daughter, and, most especially, rhea perlman as ruth (although the movie fails to mention that she was not only a tax cheat, but also stole barbie from a german doll). curiously, once they enter barbie-land, greenblatt's sasha loses much of her real-world bite. more damaging are will farrell and his hench-men from the mattel corporation. they are simply low rent buffoons who add little save for padding out the running time. occasionally, one is reminded of all those lesser snl based films where a decent sketch is stretched out to feature length. it's clever if too on the nose and obvious most of the time. nothing exemplifies this as ferrera's monologue about how it's ""impossible to be a woman."" it's well written and beautifully delivered by the actress, but, it feels out of place in a movie where the wittiest and sharpest material up until then have been half-whispered digressions, winks and nods. it's the one time the subtext takes center stage and it sticks out all the more because of that.the ending is rather sweet. barbie is about as good as one could reasonably expect from a studio concoction with gerwig et al. delivering an enjoyable lite entertainment.",NA

"2000","barbie"," anyone remember the film ""life size""?","jaywolfgramm",2024-01-24,"from a far, i can see why people would absolutely hate this movie. just the concept of ""barbie: the movie"" is enough to make people feel like the art of cinema has been compromised by corporate america. but, as a whole, this movie was very well received. it made over a billion dollars at the box-office and was nominated for 8 oscars including ""best picture"", so clearly it some people really liked it.there is a lot to enjoy in this film. the movie does a good job with poking fun at the barbie brand without it feeling too much like a spoof. this is a comedy, so the fact that the film is really funny is kind of an important element. understandably comedy is a subjective thing, so all i can say is for me, i laughed out loud several times through the movie. the movie is clever in how it treats its ""worldbuilding"" and nicely avoids any firm answers about how this world works. because, yeah, if you think about that sort of stuff in the film there is a lot that doesn't add up.it is nice that they don't spend too much time in ""the real world"" and focus on the creative fun of ""barbie world"". the movie is more visually unique and can do more gags when that is the case.when the movie is focusing on being a bizarre comedy, that is when some of the best and most memorable things happen. when it tries to have a more serious message, that is where it loses some momentum. don't misunderstand me, the movie needs some serious stuff in order to make the comedy work. and the stuff with ugly betty and her daughter is good emotional stuff. but towards the end, they realize that barbie needs to have a character arc and feel like they tack one on last second. there are some very funny jokes towards the end, but it does become a little repetitive and the message feels heavy handed by the 5th time it's brought up. side note: i wanted a cameo from the voice actress of barbie, kelly sheridan, but she wasn't there.i will emphasize this because hollywood will learn all the wrong lessons from this movie's success. we do not want a ""polly pocket"" movie or an ""uno"" movie. what made this film a success, beyond its brand or its marketing campaign, is that it was uniquely greta gerwig's vision. the movie wasn't concerned with mass audience appeal, it would tell jokes that they thought were funny and hoped others would enjoy as well. if you want to duplicate barbie's success, give creative people control to make some out there stuff.wrapped in plastic, it's fantastic.",6
"2001","barbie"," not so jolly dolly","lejink",2024-02-04,"so, last weekend my wife and i watched the oppen part of the ""barbenheimer"" 2023 box-office two-headed monster and this week it was barbie's turn. from the little i'd incidentally read in advance about the day-glo billion dollar blockbuster, i was expecting some kind of retro-cool, existentialist, post-modernist satire on the battle of the sexes, consumerism and childhood buffed up with a little diversity along the way, but somehow with all these ducks lined up in a row, i felt the film missed the mark.it starts brightly with eye-candy sets in fifty shades of pink as we're introduced to margot robbie's barbie in her barbie-world of alternative barbies, see through doll's houses and their various incomplete consumer goods, for example our girl has her daily dry-shower and drinks non-existent tea. everything appears to be perfect in her / their perfect world, unless you're the boyfriend ken, here also in a variety of forms, all doomed to exist only in barbie's slipstream and so experience recurring frustration at getting precisely nowhere, all the time, with the object of his / their, i hesitate to call it, desire.then things start to go wrong for robbie's ""stereotypical"" barbie. she thinks of death and starts to malfunction and after a visit to kate mckinnon's weird barbie, a concept i have to say i didn't get at all, she determines to go to the real world to connect with the disillusioned mattel employee, played by america ferrera, whose negativity, channelled through her disinterested daughter ariana greenblatt, is upsetting the living doll's equilibrium. ryan gosling's wheedling ken is also along for the ride and stows away in her penelope pitstop-mobile and together they head for l. a., where ferrera lives, the headquarters of the manufacturer mattel.for me, the film went downhill fast from there with ken's head getting messed-up with perceptions of patriarchy while barbie has a meltdown over her identity-crisis. there are unfunny, over-played scenes where barbie experiences humiliation at the hands of greenblatt and her school chums, traipses down to mattel hq to confront the all-male board of directors headed by a mis-cast will ferrell as the company ceo, before returning to barbie-world with ferrera and greenblatt in tow to take down ken's new-model kendom where outdated male-superiority is literally back in the saddle.i have to admit, i got very bored, very soon with this empty, supposedly satirical high-concept, fantasy-comedy. a world box-office of 1.5 billion dollars and eight oscar nominations actually makes me wonder if i've not switched places too with barbie-world as i'm afraid nothing about the movie, including the soundtrack and unsuccessful attempts at either comedy or pathos (especially when they wheel in rhea perlman as the doll's now-enlightened creator) all missing me by miles.when at one point, all her namesakes shout ""go barbie!', i must admit i was with them 100% but for completely different reasons.",3

movie review -barbie review: greta gerwig's barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly ride into barbieland. these four soft adjectives are enough to describe the barbie movie. greta gerwig takes us into barbie land with margot robbie and ryan gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. being a boy, i couldn't have a barbie doll in my childhood, but i did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. and i don't think any boy is unaware of barbie and ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. it's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. i am not at all hesitant to admit that if i were a girl, i would have enjoyed this movie more than i actually did as a boy. nevertheless, i enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.barbie begins with the inception of barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). this very scene is a lot of fun when you see margot robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. soon, we are transported into barbie land, where all barbies are living happily. all the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. our stereotypical barbie (robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. she has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. obviously, ken (gosling) forces his company on her. however, things go wrong for barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas ken finds a motto of patriarchy. ken returns and takes over barbieland by persuading other kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. here, distraught barbie finds gloria (america ferrera), a mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. gloria began playing with her daughter sasha's (ariana greenblatt) barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to stereotypical barbie. gloria restores barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all barbies.it's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so barbie certainly ends the dry spell. i mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. it may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. the humour is girlish, yes, but i liked it too. from zack snyder, the godfather, cautionary note on margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, barbie is such a colourful comedy. it does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. that's one of the points i'd say went wrong in the climax. these characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. why? pixar's toy story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. it may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. now, whether it's good or bad, i leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for margot robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as barbie. i kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and i couldn't find it for 110 minutes. i melted, man. ryan gosling's ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. that cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. kate mckinnon's weird barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. other babies, including issa rae, hari nef, alexandra shipp, emma mackay, dua lipa, sharon rooney, ana cruz kayne, ritu arya, and nicola coughlan, are all gorgeous. on the other hand, kingsley ben-adir, scott evans, simu liu, rob brydon, ncuti gatwa, and john cena as kens add fine support. michael cera, ariana greenblatt, and will ferrell pass the time well, while rhea perlman's cameo is blasting. the biggest cheer in the barbie movie came for america ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. ariana greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.made on a budget of $145 million, barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. who's to blame? rodrigo prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of barbie and ken. barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of nick houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and i have to accept that barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without greta gerwig. this woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. a few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's chuck that discussion. let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. not to forget, who's writing it.rating - 6/10*",6
"2012","barbie"," it would be nice if barbie wasn't a children's character","skipfishh",2023-11-14,"i know they're going to curse me, but i didn't think this film was as good as the rating it has here (7.0).the first 5 or 10 minutes (introduction) before the credits are wonderful, a very well thought out joke based on the introduction of ""2001: a space odyssey"", i got the feeling that a great film was coming. but it was pure illusion.first, i'd like to praise margot robbie's performance, truly sublime, she carries the film alone, as the rest leaves a lot to be desired. it leaves something to be desired as comedy, romance and fantasy, as a political, social and existentialist content, and, above all, as a children's film.i found the very inclusive cast excellent, but the ideological proposal of 90% adult fantasy, from the sarcastic jokes, through the existentialist issues of life and death, to the political and social themes, leaving the fantasy, lightness and romance in a plane below zero, everything in the film was made for a 14+ audience, well above barbie's native audience. not that i don't consider the themes interesting, yes, i like adult jokes and i value important gender and other agendas, and, yes, here in barbie they should be included, but as subliminal themes to spark interest in a child, and not as an adult fantasy script.and why do i say that? because my 5-year-old daughter, like many girls between 4 and 10 years old, has always been a fan of barbie, she has watched all the cartoons more than 20 times each one, and when for the first time a live action version of the beloved doll appears, it's not made for children brains. it's difficult, for example, to explain to my daughter the fun of a joke about plastic and real vaginas and penises, or why barbie melancholically philosophizes about death, or so many other things on that adult level of sarcasm that the film proposes. disappointing.",4
"2013","barbie"," a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society","mrdhwong",2023-07-21,"""barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by mattel. directed and co-written by greta gerwig (""lady bird"", ""little women"") and starring margot robbie and ryan gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.in barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, stereotypical barbie (margot robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend stereotypical ken (ryan gosling). one night at a dance party, stereotypical barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. the next day, stereotypical barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. after following advice from weird barbie (kate mckinnon), stereotypical barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that stereotypical ken has stowed away onboard.if you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, i'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than mattel's barbie. since first being launched back in 1959, barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even president of the united states. there have also been many movies made that star barbie in leading roles, all of which have been cgi animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. now adding to that catalogue, greta gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.what could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""the lego movie"". when we first see barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. that is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""barbies"". it is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion stereotypical ken's desire to travel with stereotypical barbie into the real world. upon arriving, ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. in any normal instance, i would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but i quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. in barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.in addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. there were a number of moments where i found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way barbieland's populace live their lives. for instance, the barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. also, the kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. however, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when barbie and ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. there's even the occasional jab taken at mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding barbie and all her accessories. while not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. in fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie i've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.i also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal cg giving barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. as one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. later when barbie and ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. it's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.as a barbie girl living in her barbie world, margot robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. the fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. robbie's barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend ken truly wants with her. though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other kens in her world. what i liked best about robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. she is curious about what type of world lies beyond barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. it would have been easy to have made this barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.whether intentional or not, i think ryan gosling's version of ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. maybe it's because i'm so used to seeing gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. although this isn't the first comedic role gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. we watch ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. there's just something about the way gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.from the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. it offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. no matter what your general opinion on barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. in that regard, this film has done its job.i rate it a solid 9/10.",9

"2015","barbie"," great for the ladies, but kens stay away","abeburnett",2023-07-21,"oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.the biggest problem with this movie is that it leans hard into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by men (as if we're some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugated-talk about intellectually lazy) and the only acceptable man is an allen (wimpy effeminate man). this movie could've provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but no. instead in the final act, it chooses sides. and the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the ""equity"" side. the side of ""well, do unto others as you feel (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they've done unto you."" you feel like the kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. never mind the barbies oppressed the kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. but no, the kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, kens, must pay.while i laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end i felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. if they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would've been a 10/10, but they couldn't resist making it propaganda. i guess the joke's on me for taking our girls to it.also, there's a monologue in the third act which could've been brilliant, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how all humans feel (not just women, men too). every man i've ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. it's not just a woman thing.oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie. it just didn't line up with who barbie was, and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occur.in the end, this ken (me) cannot recommend this film to other kens. unless you're the kind of liberal / progressive man who believes the whole ""women are oppressed"" narrative. then you'll probably love it. every other guy though? or the women who love them? i'd recommend taking a pass on this one. or watch the first 75% and then leave.bottom line this is every bit as ""toxic"" as some forms of masculinity. this is just ""toxic feminism."" and i say that as a feminist.",4

"2017","barbie"," i didn't laugh once","ben-snooks",2024-01-08,"i had trouble following this story. i got the general idea but the dialog seemed to be all over the place. in a nutshell the story is as follows. barbie senses someone is feeling bad in the real world then leaves barbieland to try to make the person feel better about themselves. meanwhile ken discovers that men have more power in the real world than in barbieland so when he goes back he rallies the other ken dolls to take power by force. meanwhile the barbie's decide to stand up for themselves and take barbieland back. somehow there's some middle ground resolution which didn't seem to make sense. the end. i didn't laugh once so i'm not sure where the comedy aspects were. i was also disappointed when ken and barbie broke out into song in the final act. it seems that whenever hollywood has a bad story then they turn it into a musical. this film was as shallow and one dimensional as a plastic doll who can't bend their knees. the characters were so boring. nothing much happens and then i was just left waiting for the film to finish. i don't expect this film to win many awards. it was more of an idea than a film with substance. i suppose it's one saving grace was that it's very much in line with american consumerism and patriotic to the 1980's american ideals of beach culture and beauty. the film manages to capitalise and celebrate the bright 1980's fluorescent colour palette that was shovelled at teenage girls in the era, ala slap bands, rollerblades, alf and fruity loops cereal. however, barbie as a character seems to be stuck in the 1980's and is really outdated and boring in the 2020's. some things should be left to age gracefully into history. especially, a stiff plastic doll without much personality.",6

"2021","barbie"," clever, dazzling, but somewhat incoherent","bobyule",2023-07-26,"on the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what i felt was an original concept. it explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of barbie and ken as its base point. there was a strong feminist theme running through it, but i did not find this overwhelming. whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.the action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. the energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.i differ from some critics in that i thought the best performance came from margot robbie as barbie. her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. i thought that the much acclaimed ryan gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.this may be down to my age and my englishness, but i was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. the young and the american will probably not have this trouble.though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when i start wanting it to end. i made it to about two-thirds of the way through.",6

"2030","barbie"," pink political power is: fun, funny at times, deep, but aggressively weird","rgkarim",2023-07-21,"likes:the setting:
-it feels like a barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-the real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really barbie land that excels in the feeling of mattel bringing it to life.the plot's originality:
-yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye
-barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety i wasn't expecting.-it may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.the acting:
-mckinnon may have been used too much, but i loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird barbie. quirky, fun, a little bold, but that snl line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-rae is fine for when she is on screen. she's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me
-ryan gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. he's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-and for margot robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. she's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the oscar performance like some call for.the comedy at times:
-the movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. the design of barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. it was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-some of the ken lines were funny, the fact that i was like classic patrick from spongebob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-and helen mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-as such, the comedy did work at times for me.the pace:
-it's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-that is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.the music:
-by far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-the songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-as for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. remixes of barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun barbie can be.the message:
-there is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... i did enjoy this part of gerwig's writing.-it's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. i liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.dislikes:the fun vibes take a detour:
-i just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-i t felt a bit forced for me, and i longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what i would have liked to see for most of the movie.gerwig's hyper agenda
-i get this is who she is, but i've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-but barbie... barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that i got tired of.-there were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what i felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-if you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.the stupidity:
-the movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.-will ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. his little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-meanwhile, ken's handling was fine being a moron, but gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-that excessiveness again just doesn't work when i saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a disney channel original movie.the character usage is odd:
-the movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-barbie has too many characters, and some of the people i expected to have more time, were limited than i anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-they do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and i think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.the story is all over the place:
-my fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.-this might give it the unique twist, but barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-one level is like i said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-the second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going
-third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way i'm still trying to process.-gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.the verdict:
barbie is a venue that i really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing i had hoped would shine in. a geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. i loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. and the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. but the movie did not appeal to me in that gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. the detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. in addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off gerwig's better writing. thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. the score is:adventure/comedy/fantasy: 7.5-8.0
movie overall: 6.5-7.0.",7

"2055","barbie"," fantastic concept, plastic execution","ian-47918",2023-08-05,"written by ian chandler - july 21, 2023mild spoilers ahead.""barbie,"" directed by greta gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. a popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year's best films. its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one's head after leaving the theater.from its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, barbie's opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. the music is great, the narration pokes fun at the barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. margot robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from barbie. accompanying her is the equally funny ken, who is played by ryan gosling. the two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. once barbie and ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. the picture's demographic is also confusing. what looked like a kids' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (for example, what a penis or a vagina means.) the sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.""barbie"" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. it sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. it makes for a frustrating ending. the moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. it may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. it may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.how characters grow is another misstep from gerwig. many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. barbie, ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. it is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. if the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. the production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. the choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. it really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.barbie - 65/100

"2059","barbie"," fantastic attention to details","mieriks",2023-07-19,"this movie, about barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!i liked the concept, and it reminded me of the toy story quadrilogy (1995-2019). the dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. the sense of humor were present, and i noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. the attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. the characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. they acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, i think.i think the story was alright. the outer story in the first and third act was good. the beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of barbie and how barbie has affected people before, but also how barbie should affect us in the right way today. it's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. the second act is a big part of a movie, and i got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. it had its meanings, but i think much of what happened, especially in los angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. it was much small-talk, and i sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.in conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. the attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. the movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. while the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. nevertheless, the movie's exploration of barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others.",7
"2060","barbie"," this isn't the movie you think it is - and it's probably better for it.","i_ailurophile",2023-07-27,"any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. case in point, last year's slasher 'they/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. this 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. more than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - i earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. and though i somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. it's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.and yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. i can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. it bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. it is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. it's not inaccurate to say that 'barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. the cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. it rather goes without saying that margot robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but i personally am also very happy to see hari nef here so prominently, and kate mckinnon is an outright joy. the crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: i do not jest when i say that everything here looks fabulous. the music is a wonderfully fun garnish that i in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that i'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. and as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. the scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. what here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? well, i gave my answer when i first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. and if that's the worst that i can say about a picture, then i'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.the promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons i admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action barbie movie on the big screen. the first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still i had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated greta gerwig's 'barbie,' from ""a film i might like to check out if i have the chance,"" to a must-see. and now that i have? while all my doubts have been erased and i could hardly be more pleased, i can also safely say that this is not the movie i was expecting. that riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). what we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. ironically, i ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. when i was younger i'd never have thought a barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.",8

"2064","barbie"," wolf in sheep's clothing","lukell-96155",2023-07-22,"this film thinks it's the lego movie but is far more akin to don't worry darling. starting off in a matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially american and girly. all kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over barbie. through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the barbies.vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. however in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.i didn't expect a pro masculine message from a barbie movie, but i also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. i would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. is this movie harmful? yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. this burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. it feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. a feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... i don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. the fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and i hope every viewer realises that.",5

"2075","barbie"," funny and entertaining but kind of a mess","imaculata",2023-07-30,"the barbie movie is a very mixed bag. it tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. margot robbie does a fantastic job as barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. all that works fantastic. but mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. it isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.the barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. but if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that ""it hates men"", then you completely missed the point. the movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. it pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against barbie as a product. this is a barbie movie after all. that this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. but the execution leaves more to be desired.there is plenty to critique about the barbie movie that is valid. the barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. the movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. instead, it is all over the place.just the plot of barbie and ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. but to the movie's credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a barbie movie. i would argue, too much.there's the plot of mattel trying to capture barbie, with the awkwardness of a mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing mattel. it never feels entirely earnest.then there's the plot of barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. this plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.then there's the side plot of barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. the barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. at first it seems as if barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. once barbie and ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. but then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. such as mattel having a mysterious floor where barbie's deceased creator is still alive. this is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn't quite explain it either. the movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. it was a side plot we didn't need in the first place.then there is the plot of ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to barbie-land. this plot feels a bit disjointed. it ends up dragging the third act back to barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. everything with barbie trying to make the other barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly barbie, should have been cut. it feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.all in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. this script could have used a bit more editing. also, it ends on a joke about barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. when you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.as a comedy movie, you can't aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie's comedy is aiming for the lowest bar. it doesn't seem to work.",7

you will laugh out loud at the clever script from director greta gerwig and co-writer noah baumbach.clearly they have done their research with every barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.the only one missing is ""trixie mattel"", based on the drag queen of the same name.america ferrera shines like a diamond as ""gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical barbie land after barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.as a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.will ferrell on the hand as the ""mattel ceo"" didn't meet the brief.i think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this fantasy land where only barbies, kens and one allan exist.while ryan gosling is the key ""ken"" based on sun lovin' malibu ken (1979), simu liu (""kim's convenience"", ""shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings"") is one of the many other ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.rhea perlman (""cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of barbies since 1959.watch out for: ""weird barbie"" (other barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by kate mckinnon and michael cera as ""allan"". he really does fit into ken's clothes.plus the pink barbie corvette and caravan are stuff you'll want to take home with you.what i loved: the plethora of barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various kens (don't forget john cena as merman ken)
listen for: dame helen mirren's hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.the production design is so elaborate that you'll want to explore ""barbie land"" in more detail using the pause button when this big screen flick moves to bluray and streaming.the movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to aqua's ""barbie girl"".unfortunately the third act lets down the movie.on the way to its denouement ""barbie"" turns into ""barbie the musical""with more singing and dancing than ""la la land"" in the ""beach off"".""barbie"" she's everything. he's just ken.if you're a barbie girl in a barbie world then come on to see ""barbie"". wear your best pink outfit, let's go party!",7

"2097","barbie"," it swings, and it kinda hits. kinda.","drawlife",2023-07-22,"barbieheimer is among us! between barbie and oppenheimer releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and i obliged.barbie is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in oppenheimer. for a movie about a children's toy, i got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. i'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. a lot of that is because this is a greta gerwig film (co-written with her partner noah baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.the unconventional approach is something to admire. the film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. the performances from margot robbie and ryan gosling carry the film. robbie tackles the role very well. the story asks her to do a lot, and robbie showcases barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. he goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his ken as well. he also has a funny rivalry/banter with simu liu's ken.rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. some highlights are kingsley ben-adir, issa rae, michael cera and kate mckinnon.america ferrara and ariana greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. for me personally, i honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. it's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.one could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while i agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. i connected more when the film explored the nature of barbie's character. there's one scene that tackles barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. shoutout to production designer sarah greenwood and set decorators katie spencer. i feel like barbie could take home the oscar for production design. when you're in barbie land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. cinematography by rodrigo prieto makes the film feel like you're there. it has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.i am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but i think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. it just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.as a male, this film isn't made for me. i'm obviously not the target audience for it. however, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where i laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where i felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. it flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6/10.",6

"2187","the beekeper"," another win for statham","cassidyblay",2024-02-01,"just caught this movie and i've got to say, i really enjoyed it. the film is a straight shot of adrenaline, packed with the kind of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. statham, as always, delivers a powerhouse performance, embodying the role with the intensity and charisma we've come to expect from him.however, the movie wasn't without its flaws. the supporting cast left something to be desired. their performances felt a bit superficial, lacking the depth needed to make the characters truly believable. there was one character in particular, whose reaction to her mother's death (a central plot point) felt off-more excited than devastated, which felt jarring given the context.despite this, the film had its high points. the humor injected through some of the characters was a welcome relief, balancing out the tension with well-timed laughs. in summary, ""the beekeeper"" nails it as an action-packed ride, thanks to statham and the comedic moments, even if it stumbles a bit with its supporting cast.",8
"2188","the beekeper"," unlistenable audio -- zero stars","nincubura",2024-02-05,"this appeared to be the usual viligante movie by jason stratham, which are usually above average; and which reliably deliver at least somewhat plausible action... unfortunately, the audio engineering was so poor that the movie was unintelligible -- without a studio quality audio compressor.it seems that the current generation of audio engineers has damaged their hearing with excessively loud music -- to the extent that they have disabled their capacity to effectively engineer audio which properly utilizes the additional dynamic range made available by modern technology.for the rest of you... the objective of greater dynamic range is not to make whspering inaudibly quiet, and explosions make your ears ring. the objective is to expand the range downward, along with the additional reduction of the noise floor. i.e., if you drop the signal to noice ratio from -60db to -100db, that allows an increase of dynamic range by 40db. specifically, the ability to hear all the audio subtlety and nuance that was previously lost in the noise. instead, contemporary audio engineers merely dispose of that nuance and subtlety, and reduce the speaking level -- to make room for louder explosions.imagine the same situation for the video presentation, on a screen that could deliver the brightness of the sun (1 billion nits). does that mean the cinematographer should cause the screen to deliver to your eyes, the full level of looking into the sun? (unless of course the objective is to show the sun and make you cover your eyes).since i couldn't hear stratham's whistering, under all the overemphasized explosions, gunshots, crashes etc... there really was no point watching the movie after about 22 minutes.an unlistenable movie gets zero stars.shame on amazon for creating junk like this, to foster prime media dis-service.",1

as mentioned above, statham has played the lead role in an action film many times and he does a great job here, it feels like he can play this role in his sleep. it isn't the toughest role he has ever taken on but it just works and he adds some legitimacy for this role and it is fun to see him play a beekeeper.supporting characters
josh hutcherson plays an annoying bad guy here and it took a while but i liked his performance here. he is just so arrogant and annoying that you really want to see him get taken down and this made me root for statham even more in this film.jeremy irons plays the head of the company that statham is after. he again is good in the role and is charisma is on full display here. it is probably one of the easiest pay checks that he has ever got but he is clearly enjoying the role.emmy raver-lampman plays a cop and i didn't really care for her performance. she is a bit over the top and her character just makes some strange decisions and it is kind of convoluting as to why she does certain things in the film.bobby naderi plays her partner and he is also cheesy and really over the top. the two of them have decent chemistry but for me it doesn't really work in this film.story
the story is pretty basic here and focuses on this guys revenge mission and in that it is pretty cool and exciting seeing statham's character go after the people that have wronged him and the people he knows. there is also a pretty cool twist towards the end of the film that made things way more interesting. but some of the others character motivations are pretty strange and the overall explanation for statham's training doesn't work with other things that happen in the film. worse of all is the really abrupt ending of the film that doesn't really answer any questions and feels really out of place.script
this is where the film really falls flat and that is the writing. this film has some real cringe worthy dialogue here, especially when it comes to the bee metaphors. but it is like the film doesn't have an ending and like the writers weren't sure what to do.style
the film has some really great action sequences. the majority of people are just here to see jason statham beat up and kill people and you get that here in spades and it is easily the highlight of the film. the film also has pretty good pacing, it doesn't overstay its welcome and i thought moved pretty well.overall
overall, the beekeeper is an above average action film. statham is great and the action is fun to watch but it is exactly what you would expect. this is probably one to watch when it comes to streaming at home instead of rushing to the cinema to watch it.rating - 6/10.",6

director david ayer (end of watch 2012, suicide squad 2016) and screenwriter kurt wimmer (salt, 2010) are very much at home in the action-violence genre, and adding the king of cinematic hand-to-hand combat, jason statham, to the mix can only mean more action and more fighting and more violence. there is no reason to critique a movie that delivers exactly what it sets out to deliver to an audience that expects exactly that.statham is in prime form as adam clay, a beekeeper on a farm owned by retired teacher elise parker (phylicia rashad, creed). when a phishing scam drains her bank accounts, including that of the non-profit she administers, clay reacts to the subsequent tragedy by tracking down the culprits of the scheme. tech fraudsters are easy targets because we all despise them, and the film plays that up by exaggerating the obnoxious nature of those involved. a miscast josh hutcherson (the hunger games) plays derek danforth, an entitled little bleep who skateboards in the office to his next massage and wears outlandish outfits befitting a person desperate for attention. adding to the psychological drama is fbi agent verona parker (emmy raver-lampman, ""the umbrella academy""), the daughter of elise, the woman who put clay on his mission of reckoning.additional supporting roles include bobby naderi as verona's fbi partner, jemma redgrave as the president, a brief appearance by minnie driver as the fbi director (she takes three quick phone calls), and oscar winner jeremy irons as wallace westwyld, the retired agent charged with keeping derek safe. the hook here is that beekeeper clay is actually a retired secret agent known as ""the beekeeper"", and in one of the oddest sequences, his replacement (a wild character inspired by prince?) brings a gatling gun to try and end clay once and for all. the film is silly and absurd, and right up the alley of those who embrace statham's stoic bulldozer of a man.",6

"2265","the beekeper"," the cinematography, editing, action & acting are buzz worthy, the script is laughable","canpatbuck3664",2024-01-26,"the reviews i've seen for the beekeeper laud it for being ""straightforward fun"" and ""an enjoyable throwback."" the underlying message is that the beekeeper is enjoyable if you can appreciate it for the genre thrills. now that i've seen it, you're going to get what you want from the action. bones are broken, bullets go flying and the bad guys are punished for their misdeeds in a satisfying and well utilized manner. i actually think the team behind the camera deserves a lot of credit for this. david ayer gets a bad rap for a couple of lacklustre movies sprinkled in with a few great ones (including one that's in the pantheon of my all time favourites, eow) but his direction here is at least a level above from what you typically get in this style of movie. the beekeeper boasts ayer's famous gritty feel and this also accents the fight scenes. but i also think the movie looks really good between the cinematography and being cut together really well so i want to credit director of photography gabriel beristain and editor geoffrey o'brien for helping the beekeeper punch above it's weight class.i've already admitted to being a big fan of david ayer but i'm also a longtime defender of jason statham. he's one of the few leading men with the chops and screen presence to lead an action movie in our modern cinematic environment (without putting on a superhero costume). he's a decent actor but more importantly, he's also secretly hilarious when given the opportunity (if you get a chance, check out his turn as rick ford in spy, he's phenomenal in that movie). i was excited that he was getting another potential franchise to lead but while he's certainly bringing his physicality to adam clay, there's a complete absence of his charm. he mostly grunts his way through the proceedings and his character felt like a rehash and the type of role he was parodying with his appearance in spy. there's some really talented names in the supporting cast as well and i thought many of them shone through some so-so material. jeremy irons brings his gravitas to the character of wallace westwyld. he's relatively grounded compared to some big performances from his cast mates and i enjoyed his measured take. i've always really liked emmy raver-lampan in the umbrella academy and i think she's the overall standout in the beekeeper. she's very serious in her early appearances (to the desired effect) but i liked her even better when she's cracking wise and trading buddy-cop barbs with her on-screen partner played by bobby naderi. she's definitely got one of the more fleshed out characters but she's got range and hopefully her work here will lead to more roles in movies. to my pleasant surprise, my other favourite performance was josh hutcherson as the unbelievably slimy derek danforth. this might not seem like a compliment as he's playing such a detestable character but i thought he was appropriately smarmy and unlikeable without chewing on the scenery (e.g. the admittedly fun but hammy job done by david witts). i wouldn't have imagined josh playing a villain but he exceeded my expectations in this role and he deserves kudos.i've mentioned the acting, the film making and the action but i have to get to the elephant in the room now. the script for the beekeeper was shockingly inept and i kept wondering how it was greenlit in this condition? travesty is a little dramatic but holy underwritten plot & characters batman! admittedly, some movies walk a fine line in tonality but not everything has to be deadly serious. there's also such things as enjoyably cheesy or deliberately hammy. i had some trouble deciding if that's what the beekeeper is aiming for. the action scenes are unflinchingly savage and the film has a mostly-serious rhythm (the all-too-real scams, the political intrigue and government bureaucracy don't seem satirical) but then there's the tongue in cheek joking, the one-liners, the knockoff wolf of wall street bravado from the villains, the constant talking about literal and metaphorical bees and over-the-top elements (a rival beekeeper whipping out a mini-gun at a crowded gas station kind of decision) that suggest it's a secret/surprise comedy. are the filmmakers being deliberately silly? are they in on the joke? is the beekeeper laughing with the audience or just missing the mark with unintentional comedic results? i couldn't really get a firm grasp on the desired tempo here but the conclusion i arrived at was that the film was serious and that the story and the script missed it's mark. the beekeeper reminded me a little of the movie skyscraper when it would careen into silliness. there's no doubt that parts of this movie were designed to be funny but i wasn't just laughing at those deliberate choices and i don't think that was what the creative team had in mind.i really tried to meet the beekeeper on every level. my combined love of both david ayer's and jason statham's work, an appreciation of straight-to-the-point action the movie boasts and a cast that showed up to work (extra credit to emmy raver-lampman and josh hutcherson). i kept hoping for a gradual turnaround, a twist that would shift the narrative from bouncing between solid action to some disappointingly goofy dialogue and storytelling, or an ending that would ratchet up the proceedings. but it wasn't in the cards and while i don't disagree that the beekeeper is a serviceable vehicle for some satisfying statham punching & kicking but this movie could have been a lot better. i saw this with a friend in an empty theatre and we were laughing, rolling our eyes and cracking jokes throughout. i would actually like to give this team another crack at it if everyone was able to return (except kurt wimmer, he can just stay home). there's a lot of talent assembled here, i just think they hit a ground rule double instead of a home run. check the beekeeper out if you're a fan of jason statham or if you can tune out your inner critic and just enjoy the action.",6

"2269","the beekeper"," this might just be jason statham's john wick","samthebestest",2024-01-17,"the beekeeper (2024) :
movie review :david ayer directs jason statham in an action-packed drama, the beekeeper. this title has a sweet meaning, but i dare you call this film or the beekeeper's character sweet. that's sour and spicy, for sure. jason statham has done popular action films like transporter, the italian job (a thriller), the mechanic, the expendables, and fast & furious movies, but has struggled a bit in the recent past. the beekeeper is an answer to that struggle, maybe. we all know plenty of kick assss action movies, but john wick has that universal recognition like no other film when it comes to the pure, mad action genre in this millenium. the beekeeper might just be that john wick kind of chapter in jason's book. this is not an exaggeration, but a comparative statement, and don't misread ""might be"" as ""is"". it's an arguable statement to avoid direct comparisons and fan wars.eloise parker (phylicia rashad), a retired schoolteacher who has never done a bad thing in her life and has devoted her time to charity, is scammed by a huge online racket. devasted, she commits suicide. adam clay (jason statham), a beekeeper working at a garage, shared a good bond with her. eloise's daughter, verona parker (emmy raver-lampman), is an fbi agent, and she arrests adam for his mother's death. soon, the investigation reveals that it was a suicide, and then clay is released. verona informs clay that the group that scammed her mother has been on the fbi's radar for some time but is difficult to track. adam then takes his own path to find the gang and runs mad on a murder spree. his last target is derek danforth (josh hutcherson), who tries his best to stop him, but he is unaware of what a beekeeper means and how dangerous he is. i don't think i should give away any spoilers on beekeeper's identity and work and how he takes on the entire gang alone, so let's keep that part fresh for your viewing experience.kurt wimmer writes a basic revenge drama, and the screenplay adds some thrilling and brutal moments. each time the beekeeper is out hunting, he stings, and he stings sharply and on the right spot. some nerve-breaking killing moments will have your eyes filled with blood, and there will be a lot of blood in front of your eyes as well. the beekeeper has some insanely ridiculous theories about its main character and his features that look ridiculously unbelievable, but also ridiculously entertaining. i mean, let's say you want a hero who can beat anybody to pulp, can burn down any place, can breach security even at the president's party hall, and then come out of everything without a scratch. wouldn't you freaking love him and scream for him? kurt wimmer has written adam clay, aka the beekeeper, with all those features. the only problem with his writing is that it follows all those traditional packages you've been served for years. predictability is not good for any film, unless it's a known/true story.let's talk about statham man. he is a killer-a real one, i mean. hobbs and shaw showed his calibre and why he deserves to be one of the leading action stars in the f&f franchise, but sadly, the makers are too busy with others even after 10 movies. this man deserves a solo action movie like the beekeeper to prove his talent. he scares hell out of everyone in movie, be it antagonists, cops, or even the bigger players in this game. emmy raver-lampman gets a few good scenes, but even those aren't healthy ones. josh hutcherson is your rich, spoiled brat and, as expected, a greedy man and a drug addict. what more can you expect from him? jeremy irons plays the interesting character of wallace, which i think had more scope but is cut short because he didn't really enter the game of blood. phylicia rashad and jemma redgrave's support is really helpful.the beekeeper is a wacky action flick with superb action choreography. geoffrey o'brien's editing keeps it short and quick, with a gripping runtime of 100 minutes excluding credits. you'll see some decent framework by gabriel beristain that could have done better, especially the creative part of long action set pieces. the film has a few loopholes that should have been covered with some emotional quotient, but what's done is done now. the sound design and production design have been okay. it's good to see the man who made the first installment of the fast & furious franchise come up with such a violent flick that isn't about logic but is hardly illogical as far as a crowd-pleasing experience is concerned. nevertheless, he delivers a worthy action drama for the devotees of the genre and devotees of jason statham. that retrograded ambition from 2001 could have been avoided, or, better yet, this film could have been made much earlier to have a better impact. but it's not that corny anyway. so, order your popcorn and sit for this 100-minute action-packed ride, and try and ask your theatre manager to skip the intermission break.rating - 6/10*",6

"2271","the beekeper"," queen of the damned","southdavid",2024-01-24,"i'm not the world biggest fan of this sort of midbudget action film, the ones that seem to end up on the streaming services rather than the big screen these days and whilst ""the beekeeper"" isn't great it's unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and some decent turns in the support cast elevate it slightly above those.when his landlady eloise (phylicia rashad) takes her own life, after her life savings are stolen from her by a cybercrime syndicate, adam clay (jason statham) sets out to avenge her. clay though is not just an ordinary vigilante, he was once a beekeeper, a member of a special government project, highly trained and given autonomy to make his own decisions about how to progress a situation. as clay kills his way up the foodchain, chased by eloise's fbi agent daughter verona (emmy raver-lampman), clay comes to learn that the syndicate have ties to government agencies, that have the resources to mount a defence against his onslaught.so, all of the good work in this is done by supporting characters, particularly raver-lampman, so good in ""the umbrella academy"", and her partner in this, played by bobby naderi. their scenes together elevate the film somewhat. josh hutchison is having a good time too, as a higher up douchebag who believes, and with some reason, that he's untouchable. one of the problems though is that statham's character is pretty lifeless. he's proved in other films he's capable of being charismatic but here he just waffles on about bees every chance he gets, which becomes hilarious the further you get into the film and the more frequently it happens. you can only mumble ""protect the hive"" so many times, before it ceases to lose all meaning.the action is fine, if perhaps lacking something truly interesting or memorable. the cgi work isn't as good as the practical stunts, and the fighting remains a touch below something like a ""john wick"". if briefly threatens to accept its dumb nature, during a fight with another beekeeper and become more fun, but doesn't commit to it for long.there's probably a desire to franchise the character, like has happened with other statham films, but i really don't think there's much more meat on what was already a modest bone.",6

-whether direct or indirect, i laughed a lot in this movie, so much so that it made me have some of the most fun in a film i have had.-the beekeeper has plenty of zingers to sting your funny bone, making you crack up with the way statham dryly delivers a message, or irons sarcasm and logic comes out like scar.-poking fun at the government system and the political jokes were toned back, purposeful and nicely finessed to be very, very fun without being too much.-and throw the character profiles being extremely goofy and adding an element of their own only helping further make the ordeal stupid fun and entertaining, alongside some of the stunts and finishes that just scream suspense of disbelief.the story to a degree
-it's got a better story than i anticipated, one that is simple, easy to follow, and perfect anchoring to the mishaps coming.-the beekeeper's story surprisingly has some decent character development to mix in, helping give some clarity to a few of the players in this weird game of extreme action chess.-and there is a little bit of a nice ""twist"" to the mix that should help give a little more to the plot they are conveying, but not enough to trip or offset the main focus of this movie.the action scenes on many moments
-perhaps the meat of the movie, the action is all about what most will be coming to see this movie for, and i'll say, it's fun to say the least.-from the first bout on, statham and the team get creative in just how much fun a special agent can have with the masses, providing lots of playgrounds to do battle on that help mix up the theme of the action at hand.-throw in the combat essentially changing hands to be one part martial arts, one part knife play, and many parts gunplay, and well, you have one heck of an arsenal to get invested into.-and many of these movements have such rawness to it, a destructive bout of shots and editing to really give you everything action junkies want in a movie with such a hardened lead.-this is where the sound and cinema work the most. not in the beautiful shots of emotional wellness, or the beautiful backdrop, and backdrops. .
-no, instead this time it's about pulling together and bringing the pure spectacle of elite ops vs. the world, and it accomplishes it in that statham glory.the emotional fulfillment
-there are those movies that know how to deliver that shot and moment that just screams full satisfaction.-to my surprise, the beekeeper accomplished this for me, several of those moments captured in the perfect shot as the statham gets that hit or kill that just makes you nod.-it adds a little more to the violence, gives some depth to his character without words, and helps to give this movie just that bit of depth that other films in this franchise lose when it's all about mediocre presentation.the music
-a nice little mix of genres, the music has some comedic aspects and energy as clay journeys on his quest for vengeance.-one part is song you will know, a blend of a lot of tracks that match the dynamic of the scene. while the other part is a typical hollywood soundtrack of powerful instruments in the background to add that small oomph to the symphony of sound effects.dislikes:the plot
-it's nothing special and quite linear, good on many levels, but will get lost in the sea of action films that we have.-there is little diving into most characters, it's quite lacking in terms of unique fervor, and the extra information just doesn't have the delivery that much of the john wick series does.-it's not what most are going for, but... given some of the legendary actions films have a bit more meat to their, i can't say i wasn't disappointed not to have more to the story.it's sort of ridiculous
-to an extent, all action movies are ridiculous.-but in this film, the movie's stunts are sometimes a bit too silly and extreme to not laugh and lose the respect and focus i had in the first part of the film.-throw in the unbalanced strength factors in this movie being quite wider than i like to see and the movie just breaches a story that sort of lacks that organization i like to see in movies like these that have that balance of comic awesomeness and reality edge.excessive language
-by this point i've become desensitized, but the language is annoying at times to the point that again, there are better phrases and words to use.-the f and mf terminology is their bread and butter of the movie, so if you have a sensitivity for these words, avoid this movie at all costs or be ready expletive city.-it's lazy writing at times, but it sells, and at times they nail the timing and make it worthwhile.some violence hard to watch
-there are many moments that desensitized people like me can handle with no issues and laughing at the pure bliss of excitement.-and then there are some moments that are going to be hard, cringeworthy stabs, carving, and a few other means that are going to be hard to watch.-though it doesn't hit the levels of hostel or saw, it may still be something to be wary of given some of the finishing moves statham brings with it.an element of action.-mainly a lot of invincibility/superman complexes for much of the movie that can lead it to be a bit boring.-wick, olympus has fallen, james bond, and more take hits and come close to taking hits, which adds excitement, fun, and that danger sense.-the beekeeper though doesn't do this much of the movie, meaning the spectacle and finishes carry the excitement rather than the threat to our antihero. had they cleaned that up a bit, it might have added even more to the mix.the verdict:
the beekeeper is a smash hit when it comes to the mindless action and fun of watching a one man army take out the bad guys. very fast, very exciting, and holding enough merit to build a foundation that will give a meaning to the chaos and violence you are watching. comedy helps add some pizazz to the mix, a little relief to the darker undertones that go well with the action. add in the sense of justice and some engaging action that really helps this movie thrive and excel in the promised entertainment the trailers sent in their advertising. and with the simplicity comes the limitations of story, the stupid antics that are hyperbolic feats of super human levels, and some rather one sided antics that can be a bit stale. throw in some hyper language use and some hard to watch moments, and you round out this movie to some statham fun that is familiar, a tad stale, and dare i say a bit too familiar to be unique and engaging. still, this one is worth a trip to the theater for just the fun times, and definitely one worth watching at home.my scores:
action/thriller: 7.5

"2307","the beekeper"," a dumb but very fun ride","stevencayer",2024-01-22,"to be, or not to be? the beekeeper is a movie that has jason statham in it. there, if you know jason statham, i've given you all the knowledge you need for this movie and you can stop reading now. for those of you who might need a little more information, the rest is for you. this is an action movie that is the most accurate depiction of ""it's so bad it's good"". it's about adam clay (jason statham), who is retired from his job and is now beekeeping for eloise (phylicia rashad), who is letting him stay in the barn. eloise gets targeted by a phishing scam that robs all of her money. after tragedy strikes, adam goes on a revenge rampage following the money trail, using his specific set of skills as a ""beekeeper"". it's very rare when i can safely say that i loved and hated this experience. the script is horrible, but hilarious. the antagonists are cartoony, but hilarious. the violent action is great. the non-stop bee puns are fantastic, but not for everyone. the supporting cast is actually good, involving a unique role for josh hutcherson, jeremy irons, even minnie driver for some reason. i enjoyed how similar it is to john wick. he's just trying to ""protect the hive"". phishing scams are still very prevalent in today's society, and this movie is a reminder to always be careful online, unless you're friends with jason statham. he had a bad year last year with the meg 2 and the expendables 4, but this is definitely his niche. we just need to not take his movies seriously. if you see the beekeeper, just shut down your brain for a couple hours and enjoy the ride. i highly recommend this!",8

"2317","the beekeper"," give the fire fighters a break.","africanbro",2024-01-20,"the opening title sequence sets an intense and epic vibe, almost like a dark psychological thriller. this is an instant classic, instant! it's like if john wick was the equalizer, but it's jason statham, who happens to have a fascination with bees and bee analogies. while i recently haven't watched statham's best movies, this one compelled me to label it as some of his best work yet. but that's probably the adrenaline speaking. the fight scenes were both cool and intimidating, often laced with moments of humor as statham toyed with his adversaries.the story was just okay, nothing spectacular even though the big bad was essentially the biggest big-bad; but to be honest the story's just a bonus, it's like a favor from the writers because the whole movie is really just jason statham engaging in relentless action, whooping butt. i think this is the first action movie of this sort i've enjoyed this much since the first two equalizer films with denzel washington.now, my primary gripe lies in the lack of truly formidable antagonists-except for the afrikaans dude, most of the villains felt rather lackluster in posing a challenge to mr. cray. a touch of additional villainous depth could have heightened the movie's tension. bad guys could've been more bad ass. i always knew mr cray was gonna win the next fight, it never felt like the stakes were high.jason statham undoubtedly shines as one of the finest action stars, showcasing his prowess in this film. fifth movie in a year. i love how even though there's a few funny bits, they're not inherently comical; the main character has serious, no-nonsense demeanor, maintaining a dark and brutal persona throughout. the film wisely refrains from diluting this intensity with unnecessary jokes or lightheartedness. while not flawless-some minor issues with dialogue and acting in non-action segments-i highly recommend if you're an action fan. but even if you're not, because my sister had a blast with this too.also there are no credit scenes, i googled but a couple websites seem to have it mixed up with aquaman credit scene.",7

"2336","the beekeper"," he's a beekeeper.","kfstudios2009",2024-01-31,"i had high expectations for this movie, and in the end, this was just a normal action flick for a one time watch, nothing special that you are getting. i really liked the main character, the beekeeper, adam clay, that was performed by jason statham. i will tell about the performance first. statham was very cool in his role, he put humor into the beekeeper and the personality he had was really well adapted by him. the badass face, dialogues and outfit made him a really dangerous keeper of bees. from the story side, i think the beekeeper agency concept was very cool, and the main character had a motive and good reason to kill so many people. i liked the metaphor about the hive, how the society system can be compared to it, and that sometimes, you just have to kill the bee queen (watch the film to understand that part). the main antagonists, a group of rich hacker-scammers, were good enough for the role as the menacing bad guys. i just wished that the boss for the bad guys could have a better backstory and have some more space in the film, make him more important, more concerned about the beekeeper, just something to make him better. the story had a good flow, yet it was very generic. the introduction for the beekeeper agency and the scammers in the beginning was cool, but later, they got out for ideas and just went into action. the thing is, i wished more plot, more that could happen, not only fighting. anyways, a few action sequences were great and enjoyable, while others felt messy and unorganized (something i have noticed in many action movies recently). the final act did build up a good suspense to the final point, and the ending was cool and it finished well. the acting was mostly carried by the badass jason statham, and the rest was mediocre and on a very low scale. you know how it is in an action movie, the main character is out for hunting, while there is always that one person that follows him? well, there was something in here, too. a cia agent that thinks the beekeeper had good intentions for killing, but she wants to stop him before he have killed to many. and she was kind of unnecessary when i think about it. she had a connection in the story, but this could work easily without her and they could put more story instead. she wasn't performed that well, too. summarizing, the beekeeper was an ok action flick that could have been much better, and if you like badass killers and actors like vin diesel, jason statham or sylvester stallone, this one is just for you.",6

"2341","the beekeper"," buzzing with brutality and a bit of stinging social commentary","steveinadelaide",2024-01-15,"the beekeeper is not another typical sugary action film. it is a brutal revenge story characterised by biting social commentary and violent fights. the lead role of adam clay, a former operative in the secret dark government organisation called beekeepers, is played by jason statham, who wears the beekeeper's hat. adam has been left without his only friend, who was scammed online. he decides to sting the corrupt corporation that stole away his dear friend, leaving behind maimed bodies and broken secrets.david ayer, director of macho war movies, has brought the same level of intensity to the beekeeper. fights between combatants are raw, with statham as usual in his signature balletic violence. he acts like a beekeeper, protecting the hive, dealing with thugs, and methodically beating them down one by one; all of these blows hurt the system he opposes.the beekeeper is not all fists and fights (well, not quite). surprisingly, it weaves a complex web of themes. this means that its objective is to focus on unmasking the evils of corporate greed and their effects on people. however, adam's fascination with bees shows how society interacts with everyone, for even little things can cause massive changes.emmy raver-lampman as adam's friend's estranged daughter and an fbi agent, and jeremy irons playing a chillingly charismatic ceo, give impressive performances among others who make up this cast. raver-lampman brings some much-needed emotional depth, while irons drips wickedness out of every word spoken through his unique style.however, at times, this film fails to live up to its own ambitions. the story line, despite being captivating, tends to be somewhat predictable at times, while the pacing occasionally becomes clumsy, going from one action sequence to another without providing much scope for thematic exploration. moreover, dialogue sometimes becomes clich√©d, especially when too many bee-related puns come into play.however, the beekeeper has enough energy to keep your attention. this is a movie that is not scared of getting its hands dirty in either the literal or metaphorical sense. it's a brutal bee sting of a film that makes you itch to fight for what is right, even when stung in the process.so, should you watch the beekeeper? if you are just looking for senseless action, this one may not be for you. if you fancy violent movies that have an absurd plot yet still employ social commentary, then perhaps it may be worth your time to go and see it. just remember, it's a jason statham action movie. if you've seen one before, you'll know what to expect!",7

"2413","dune"," beauty without soul or substance","arabnikita",2021-09-26,"dune (2021)by now, it is undisputable that denis villeneuve is a master of creating mesmerizing visuals and dune is probably his biggest achievement as every single frame looks surreal. frankly, i expected nothing less but ironically, the gorgeous visuals are also the reason for the film's weaknesses. on one side, they create an immersive experience; on the other, it feels like the director is trying to show off instead of crafting a compelling story for the audience to connect to. nevertheless, it is a movie and it is bound to deviate from the source material so i will try to judge accordingly.while villeneuve is an artistic genius, this isn't one of his personal art house projects but an adaptation of the greatest science fiction novel, which naturally carries expectations. the world of dune is as complex as that of game of thrones where everything is intricately connected and the multilayered characters are filled with ambition; not to mention the philosophy. unfortunately, none of this is created here and half of the big name actors are reduced to saying a few lines in favor of showing 15 pointless visions of zendaya in the desert.by struggling to establish the characters and the narrative, the film ends up lacking a soul and as result, it is impossible to care about anything. yes, every shot looks phenomenal but it doesn't stir a single emotion and no matter how pivotal the scene is, it just feels hollow. the excessive long takes leave little time for development and hence, key narrative moments end up being rushed. even some action scenes feel underwhelming as they lack any energy and almost feel forced.despite the anticlimactic end, i am eagerly waiting for part 2 which will hopefully explain the world and allow the remaining characters to flesh out. chalamet did a decent job as paul but he needs to put on some muscle as he is pitiful to look at during the action sequences. at the end of the day, dune is one of the most beautiful films that i have ever seen with the aesthetics and sound being worthy of imax. sadly, the essence and complexity of dune itself feels either rushed or lost in between the grains of sand and the panoramic takes.movies.shmovies in instagram for movies and tv shows.",8

"2429","dune"," visually decent, but something is missing","alex-322029310",2021-09-27,"i have long waited to see this new attempt at turning herbert's book into a movie. the ingredients sounded promising (villeneue, zimmer, cast, ...) as well as the praise the movie has received so far.trying to immerse myself into the universe the film constructs, or better, translates from the book, i need to say for me there is something missing. i've seen lynch's adaptation, have read the book, and played the dune games (esp. dune 2) day and night in my teenage days. maybe it is because of this background, that i felt empty during most of the runtime of the movie. the book is difficult to translate to the screen, depicting not only the political conflicts, but also the inner conflicts and motivations of its protagonists vividly.the movie tries not to deviate too much from the book's storyline, which i have to give villeneuve credit for. but in contrast to blade runner 2049, the movie runs quite flat on the emotional side. but as said, maybe because i already know what happens next, and have already immersed myself into the imaginative dune universe countless times, i felt like i was in a half-dreaming state phantasizing these visuals, but not actually watching a captivating story.there is little dialogue and another point of critique is zimmer's work in this. someone here wrote that he considers the dune soundtrack zimmer's magnum opus, but to me this was interstellar (2014). the score in blade runner 2049 was already quite minimalistic, but i credit zimmer for at least using the cs80 like vangelis did, thereby finding the right sounds for the futuristic setting. but here, in dune, there is even more absence of any theme/leitmotifs, it's just a combination of a few chords and drones which sometime do not match the film's flow, with some occasional ethnic vocals which are absolutely over the top. it feels like zimmer tried hard to find the right music for this movie, but in the end, delivered something absolutely generic that a young aspiring composer would probably be ashamed of.nevertheless i think i can recommend watching the movie, especially for people who have not read the book. i hope villeneuve will be able to deliver the second (and third?) part, because probably it will turn out that the movie was deliberately filmed in the style of a two hour long prologue.just do not expect too much; i think the praise that the movie has received on its own is a bit too much for the actual product, but in the end, let's see where this franchise goes, probably this dune will be the perfect movie if seen as a part of a trilogy.",8

"2483","dune"," an instant classic/masterpiece for all time","scottmannen1",2021-09-22,"the original dune film created and released by david lynch is undoubtedly a cult classic film. this 80's version of dune was epic with grand visual cinematography, breathtaking costumes and a story that absolutely is a masterpiece. where the original falls short is on flow and pacing. it dragged out in some areas.the new dune film created by denis villeneuve contains many similarities when compared side by side with the original. in fact, the new dune more closely follows that novel, and instead of having one long movie like the original, the new dune fits about half of the original dune story into a 2.5 hour film whereas the original fit the entire novel into that same 2.5 hours.the good news is that by splitting the novel into a 2 part film such as villeneuve has done, it captures more of the novel in total. the result is a more detailed dive into the dune novel that effectively eliminates many of the pacing issues that plagued the original film.the cinematography is next level on visuals. the world of dune is breathtaking to see visually. the costumes are unique and gorgeous to view. it is very clear that dune is a film with a massive budget...something that is quite rare to see anymore. studios are more careful than ever when it comes to doling out the budget for blockbuster films anymore. in recent hits the only films with such large budgets are usually just marvel films, so it is refreshing, unique and simply a visual treasure to look at this blockbuster film type that is actually filmed in imax for that incredible experience.we know the budget is there, but how about the story? since this films source material comes from frank herbert himself, one simply could not have asked for a better story. in fact dune is quite often hailed as the single greatest sci-if novel ever created, and that is an accolade that is no small feat! the key was for villeneuve to accurately convert that story into film accurately. i am pleased to say that this was clearly handled with kit gloves and deftly converted in a very effective manner. in my opinion we have an instant classic film! the story and even the pacing is as close to perfect as many could have hoped!the acting and actors for dune is simply a roster of some of the most talented a-list thespians on the planet! i could name this list for you here, but it is long and ""star studded"" as they say. the acting is fantastic and well performed across the board. the surprise performance out of an already amazing list would surprisingly go to jason momoa and josh brolin who brought ""sizzle"" t9 their respective roles! additionally, the role of paul by timothy chalomet was good but particularly rebecca ferguson as lady jessica is a stand out for sure.this film is absolutely worth the money to go ""experience"" at imax. notice i said ""experience"" as opposed to saying watch? this film in imax is just that type of film. most people watch films, but dune is a movie to ""experience"" if you are able to attend in imax. this show ranks very high across the board in every single category, but the entertainment value is particularly high, something that can be difficult to achieve in such a long run type film.9.5/10. i haven't really ever issued a perfect score to any film, but since i am unable to review score an imdb film at 9.5/10, i then give this film score a 9/10 official review. i have only ever given out such a high score once, and that was for game of thrones who i rated the same. do yourself a favour and view this in imax, worth every penny!",10

"2490","dune"," set up for disappointment but boy was i wrong...","snidgy",2021-09-20,"let me start off by saying i am not the biggest connoisseur nor fan of the original dune book and/or earlier movie and series adaptations.and, contrary to some of the remarks made on this forum i am also not related to the director or hired to write this review. i can also understand that this movie may not be to the liking of quite a few moviegoers and some may even feel somewhat cheated after seeing the movie versus the trailer. it may not be the 'frozen'-type of deceit (both my sons expected something completely different that time around, lol) but still dune is set up quite differently in the trailers (primarily more action-focused) than the movie itself turns out to be; at least this first part.i myself so much wanted to enjoy this movie which in my case usually can only lead to disappointment in the end....having said all of this i personally can only conclude that i truly, whole-heartedly love this movie. it is immersive beyond anything i have seen in cinema over the past decade, and maybe even during my lifetime. the feel of the worlds in which the story place (caladan but obviously primarily arrakis) is so brilliantly portrayed that i immediately felt drawn into the story and stayed that way throughout the full length of the movie.the mythological aspects of the story and analogy with western civilization versus 'the rest' of our own world managed to make the movie really recognizable despite of the obviously completely fictious setting. the acting, dialogue, directing, art direction, cinematography, special effects, color pallet, pretty much every aspect of this movie was top-notch.just a last quick warning of what dune is not: it is not a modern star wars-like adventure with laser guns. it is not an action-packed marvel-type movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 35 minutes straight (and don't get me wrong, i personally really enjoy those type of movies as well).dune may take a bit of an investment by some to understand what it's not and to appreciate what dune actually is; a truly marvelous piece of filmmaking, enriched by a true love of cinema of the filmmakers and where the story itself is the most important of all (not the thrills or special effects).watch it on the biggest possible screen you can find and enjoy.i sincerely cannot wait to see part two and to marvel at the conclusion of this epic piece of cinema.what a time to be alive and witness this.p. s. if warner bros' decision to simultaneously launch dune in the us on hbo max and in cinemas, will result in disappointing box-office results and, as a consequence, limit the production budget or even worse, possibly the making of dune part two, i will seriously contemplate boycotting wb for the foreseeable future.",10
"2491","dune"," simply great, an instant classic!","criticalstaff",2021-09-18,"the biggest question with this film was: was villeneuve able to deliver? you got one of the most popular sci-fi novels, a cast of talented and very charismatic actors, and a generous budget. was villeneuve the right choice to direct this film; could he muster all these resources and use them effectively to tell a story? could he make a film that is enjoyable to watch and at the same time adapt a convoluted cult-classic on which numbers of filmmakers have stumbled?turns out, the answer is yes.the real cornerstone of the movie, if you put aside the special effects, the plot and the visual storytelling, is the pacing. the film takes its time and lays out confidently most of the techno-babble and sci-fi jargon upfront. yet, it is not boring or annoying. in any situation or scene, you know what is going on, who is doing what, and generally speaking the action is clear. that is something that was absent from lynch's dune. it is challenging to deliver a lot of information in a digestible manner, especially with the sort of sci-fi such as dune. but the movie does it patiently and clearly. most of the time a concept is set-up in one scene and then shown or explained in the next. not only was everything clear in terms of stakes; but it was also engrossing in terms of tension. not only do you understand what paul is up against, but you want him to succeed.the story of dune is the story of paul atreides, the young heir of a noble family. one thing that is cool in dune is: it's feudalism in space. so, you get something that is closer to game of thrones than star wars.the movie follows the adventure of young paul. how he makes the transition to a new world, has to come to grips with becoming a leader and is destined to become a prophetic messianic figure. that stuff is good, but i always thought it was the weaker aspect of the novel dune. the story of a young boy who discovers awesome powers that leads him to rule the universe is pure power fantasy. it is more appealing to young boys than anyone else. thankfully, the plot weaves-in the space politics and keeps your attention. it presents a lot of that messianic text in ethereal settings: dreams, distant voice-overs and flash-forwards. leaving the primary action to focus on the back-room intrigues and political upheavals.generally speaking, it takes the established source material, but paints it with the villeneuve brush. the movie has that visually sleek minimalist style, where heft is rather communicated with sound. those are the same ingredients that made blade runner 2049 a good movie. in many ways, this movie is more of the same, there is not much innovation stylistically. on the other hand, why change a winning formula?my only caveat is: you have to love sci-fi to like this. your typical grandma will not enjoy this.",9

"2514","dune"," cinema is back!!!!","vicrknudsen",2021-09-18,"it has been one year and eight months (approx.) since the world went into lockdown and cinemas closed, and studios postponed hundred of releases. during this pandemic, there have been ups and downs concerning the reopening of cinema, and with a little luck, some movies had a limited run in some theaters last year, moreover, some films going directly to streaming services. now, the situation in denmark has been very different compared to other nations, but luckily our theaters opened for good in may 2021, the films began coming back. though i really liked movies such as ""the green knight"" which i saw in the cinema, there hasn't been one film in a long time when i have thought: this is a masterpiece; this is cinema. until now.""dune"" is a masterpiece. it is first-class movie making and one of the best cinematic experiences i have ever had. not only did villeneuve manage to adapt a story into a film that is supposedly impossible to make, but he also did it with excellence. ""dune"" is an epic in every way. its grand production design and world-building take ones' breath away from the first glimpse of the desolated planet. the visual effects are jarring and completely emerge into the real set pieces to make a realistic depiction of a future world. costumes and make-up are creatively put together and adapts an impossible atmosphere to the story. ""dune"" is just a stunning-looking film.villeneuve's masterful direction is one thing. another this that is as good, and maybe probably is my favorite part of the film is hans zimmer's score. though zimmer's career, he has made iconic scores to numerous huge and influential films. music that can stay in your mind for days, and you can listen to and feel you're in the world. what zimmer did with his score for ""dune"" is simply out of this world. it's instrumental with choir and big ass drums and horns that will blow you up from your seat. the atmosphere he creates is unbelievable and never gets boring or in the way of the story. zimmer uses tricks to mix sounds into the score, so it feels supernatural to see the big actions scenes and not think ""hmm that's a good score,"" because you don't notice it because it's so deep down part of this film. he will and surely deserves to win an oscar for his work here. it's just been released on spotify and other streaming services so if you can't wait, go listen to it.villeneuve has before taken up almost impossible projects and made them work. his vision for ""dune"" is so compact and tolerable that i couldn't see anyone else's creativity affect ""dune."" every aspect he put in play with the characters and the way he wants to move the camera is incredible. his direction is first-class movie making and quite possibly his best work next to ""arrival."" it feels grand and epic in the same tone as ""the lord of the rings"" feels humongous in its character gallery and universe.the story is rich in characters, and all the actors do an equally great job embodying each person. timot√©e chalamet, as the lead, paul, does an amazing job portraying this ambiguous hero. though his character for some part of the film is mostly held back because of his father (oscar isaac), paul learns much about leadership and why the planet of arrakis feels familiar to him. isaac is a scene-stealer every time he's on screen. he's such a likable character that easily could have been a clich√©tic menacing-king with his only desire to rule and gain power. his performance is beyond what i expected; he's terrific.rebecca ferguson also gets better and better in every single film she does. i loved her in ""doctor sleep,"" and in ""dune"" she shows a more quiet and subtle yet powerful performance. the rest of the cast is bloody amazing. everybody could be a stand-out alone, and reminds me a lot of the character depth there is in each of the fellowship members in ""the lord of the rings.""was i excited for ""dune?"" absolutely! i can't wait to buy it on blu-ray and dive into the story again. my girlfriend, who loves epic sci-fi/adventures told me that it has probably become one of her favorite films. though it doesn't fall into my top 50, i can't do anything but give it a top score. what ""dune"" manages to do cannot be seen through. and i have missed it. i have missed it so damn much to feel engaged and to be fed with a story with so much flesh on. to relive the old days of cinema and to look forward to a new and exciting adventure. i'll be seeing ""dune"" again sometime next week. hopefully, a second movie will come because this is only part one. don't expect to be fully satisfied. this is only the beginning.",10
"2515","dune"," like foreplay, not for those looking for a quick thrill","robinalers",2021-09-27,"dune isn't the movie that any of us expected (especially not the ending). but the original story is so grandiose and long, that telling it in one sitting would be too difficult. one could argue that two movies might not even do the story and works justice.anyway, this is not the epic movie that people expected beforehand. yes, it was visually stunning with fantastic sound design (including music) and great acting. but it was not the action packed movie that you might have expected from the trailer, the first movie adaptation, or even the book. is that a bad thing though? not in my opinion.it sets a great tone and much like the characters in the story, you feel trapped in the situation. even before they leave their home planet, paul and his family (especially his dad) seem to be aware of the fact that their hand is forced and that their house is in tremendous danger. that ""trapped"" feeling never leaves you and only becomes stronger as the movie progresses due to its scenes and tempo. but that means it ""lacks"" in the blockbuster action (though it is there).to sum it up:
dune is like foreplay. you have to be able to enjoy the continuous tension and the lack of a climax.those who love that, will love dune. those looking for a quick ""bang"", will not.",8

"2531","dune"," a science-fiction epic that takes its time setting the stage and rewards you with a rare visual spectacle that needs to be seen on a big screen!","adamantiumlive",2021-09-20,"i got out of the film about an hour ago, so the impressions are still relatively fresh. however, i don't think that anything can shake my almost entirely positive view in the near future. the biggest compliment i can give right now is how new and original it feels. right from the first minute it sucked me into the world of dune. it was like witnessing the birth of a vast new film universe that wants to reach out to its audience and be discovered.you can tell that this is only the first half of the book. everything is set up at a slower pace and you get to know the different parties and characters first. as someone who has neither seen the book nor the film from 1984, i say: if they only spend half the time, shortened or sped it up, the events in the last third would not have had the same effect. the key moments carried a lot more weight and i noticed how i was able to empathize more with paul as a person, especially towards the end.on a visual level, this film is outstanding, and i've rarely seen one where the full experience was so closely connected to the big screen. the camera shots are just gorgeous and i almost got tears in my eyes finally seeing such beautiful science fiction since a long time. everything felt so grand and the cinematography is on point. especially the sequence in which house atreides travels to arrakis is absolutely epic. there is also the sound design that completely utilises the capabilities of the dolby atmos system in my cinema. i'd say it was perfect for my taste.explosions, the sandworms and spaceships were appropriately loud, but small nuances are never lost, everything is properly mixed and dialogues are always understandable. meanwhile, hans zimmer's soundtrack thunders from all speakers at the right moments and emphasizes the visual spectacle. you can tell that this is one of his most ambitious projects, it's also one of the most experimental soundtracks of the year. there are beautiful, melancholy sounds, in other places female singers sing in their highest voice and sometimes hissing voices whisper ominous texts.the only real flaw is that the film ends. it is an ending that is untypical for a blockbuster these days and asks the viewer to think about the development of the characters over the course of the story again. if you don't know that this is only the first half of the story, i can understand if you end up a bit let down in the credits. ""part two"" will therefore have a huge impact on how ""part one"" will be viewed in the future. there is currently no movie that needs a sequel more than dune. it would be a crime against cinema if it gets never made due to potentially lower audience numbers.",9

"2561","dune"," it certainly feels like ""just the beginning"", but by god am i ready for more","thevictoriousv",2021-10-03,"i am confident denis villeneuve's dune will go down as the definitive screen version of frank herbert's revolutionary novel (as with greta gerwig's take on little women; technically the latest one of many, but undoubtedly the finest).we all know the 1984 david lynch version and how fate was unkind to it. some will also be aware of the previous attempt by alejandro jodorowsky, as documented in the film jodorowsky's dune, where the concept art by h. r. giger at least eventually gave us 1979's alien - this particular dune adaptation was ultimately lost.now, we have what's possibly the ultimate dune film, and its director has been exquisitely selected, having previously expanded on ridley scott's blade runner in a way that made the world feel larger, without forgetting the themes and internal rules of what it set out to adapt. (i know a certain other science-fiction/fantasy franchise that's been having some trouble with that; it was about stars going to war or some nonsense.) granted, had villeneuve truly been free from sony's influence when he made blade runner 2049, we wouldn't have had rick deckard's involvement spoiled by the advertising.as for dune, the world of its source material indeed feels more awesome in size - and intricate in detail - than in the 1984 film, and villeneuve's knack for imposing visuals and atmosphere, resulting in that sense of interstellar awe that good science-fiction ought to bring, remains untarnished. he understands the sheer otherworldly potential of cinema, better than many other blockbuster-makers.hollywood can render new cg worlds, ""cool"" creatures, and idiotic action scenes starring black widow to their heart's content; they will always seem cartoony and predictable without the right shading, weight simulation, framing, and sound design. it looks and feels as if we've entered a distant moment in mankind's future, where the sights are truly new and humbling, yet our proclivity for conquest, fanaticism, and imperialism remains the same - they're not just dangling cybertron or lamentis in front of the adult babies' faces.that being said, i admit there are some things that seem studio-imposed for the sake of juicy pr, including race- and gender-bending of various characters. the reason given by warner bros is that reworking those characters served to complement their roles in this universe; to better mirror our own peoples, or perhaps predict their fate. i understand the book was partially inspired by middle eastern culture and islamic scripture, and that white-washing the ""fremen"" in particular might've weakened its impact - and, for lack of a better term, its relevance. my only issue here is with the cringey reactions from the usual journalists.this is to say nothing of vanity fair's generation z-friendly reporting that timoth√©e chalamet's character will be akin to greta thunberg if she was, and this is an actual quote, ""a jedi with a diploma from hogwarts"" (which several droning stans probably think she is already). i don't know that dune ever panders to the little activists quite so embarrassingly, but the article surely turned some heads. this is what matters.speaking of actors, the film features a myriad of hollywood stars, all of them seminally cast in terms of both appearance and skill. chalamet now plays paul atreides, oscar isaac portrays his father leto (the duke of house atreides and the new head of the ""spice-mining"" colonies of planet arrakis), rebecca ferguson is lady jessica, zendaya is chani, josh brolin is gurney halleck, jason momoa is duncan idaho, javier bardem is stilgar, charlotte rampling is gaius helen mohiam, and stellan skarsg√•rd (gloriously) plays the beastly baron harkonnen.there's also dave bautista as harkonnen's most trusted nephew and david dastmalchian as piter, the ""mentat"" of his house/planet. many of these characters barely get an introduction - which is one of many ways that dune feels exactly like what it is; the first half of the first book.of course, not everything in the film feels ""new"". we've naturally been to the world of dune before, albeit a cornier version of it. some images and themes bring star wars, mad max, the chronicles of riddick, and oblivion to mind (note that the dune books predate these works by a minimum of ten years), as well as previous villeneuve pictures like arrival and the aforementioned blade runner (there are even some visual call-backs to his first masterpiece incendies).but it's the sense of scope he brings to these visuals that make them feel truly alien and intimidating, albeit maintaining a human element (i.e. the many great characters and their roles in the system) that makes this future seem believable; a world where computers are banished but we've discovered the ""spice"" that may make our meaty brains surpass the computational power of machines. there is a sense that we've come a long way, possibly much too far.",9

"2632","dune"," a review for the readers of the original story","daniel-a-1998",2021-09-18,"after a long wait - when the film was actually supposed to premiere in october last year - dune hit cinemas in sweden during the week. i just refreshed my memory of the original story when i finished reading the book a second time before the cinema visit.taking on a story with as much weight and the scale that dune has is no easy task. but with what the canadian director already has in his luggage, denis villeneuve seemed to be the most suitable man for the job when he took on the project a few years ago. with the results in hand, dune is absolutely massive and an almost unbeatable cinematic experience when it comes to the pure scale of the picture. the trust in villeneuve has paid off.the scenes are epic and magnificent and the soundscape is huge. hans zimmer, who composed the music and constructed the sound, has polished his creation so that the bass tones make every single bone in the body vibrate. it is noticeable that he is a big fan of the book since he has worked beyond the ordinary with this project. zimmer combines heavy drums and bass lines in all frequencies with almost religious voices to create something unique. when ships fly past the camera, it is difficult not to get goosebumps.timoth√©e chalamet is in my opinion one of the best actors of my generation. i already know that he can act but dune is proof that he can shoulder the greatest of roles with bravura. the entire cast is right for their roles. stellan skarsg√•rd as the evil baron is a great antagonist and the mother jessica's emotional bond with her son is beautifully portrayed by the swede rebecca ferguson.dune does not follow traditional film structure but is quite similar to the book. i think the film will appeal to the fans of the book more than the usual cinema visitors as the exposition at the beginning of the film is fast-paced and the story is complex and often throws itself with terminology that many people may not have heard before. the film also does not leave much time to breathe for the viewer to digest what happened as all the scenes are eventful and important for the story. if you take a toilet break, there is a great risk that you have lost yourself in the story when you return.with gorgeous design and many practical effects, dune is visualized how i experienced it in my head when i read the book - and not many book-based films succeed with this. the atmosphere is deep and grabs you easily. i think it was very helpful that they filmed on location in the desert in jordan because the heat and thirst really gets to you. beautiful environments and great detail - what more could you want? dune is a very good film adaptation of a very good book.",10

"2635","dune"," i'm still figuring out if it's a masterpiece...","mesdecupy",2021-09-25,"where are the bad reviews?? i can't find them, everybody seems to love this movie. me as well, i think it might be the best in the last two years, and it will probably stay that way for some time.dune is an epic sci-fi fantasy art work, and denis villeneuve proves again that he knows how to craft an enormous picture around an actual simple story. for me, 'dune' talks about the difficult responsibilities a young heir apparent must face when his family, or his house, house atreidies, gets involved in a huge political game between other houses concerning the distribution of territory and spice, a special resource, on arrakis. most characters are portrayed very subtle and without any excessive actions. for me, that way of creating character and depth works, some people may find it a bit difficult to connect with. rebecca ferguson stood out the most for me, i think her performance is worthy of an oscar nomination.it feels very slow at times, and at times a little too slow. i like denis' style, and it's not as slow as blade runner 2049, but because of the general pacing in this film, there were some moments when i would have liked it a little shorter.technically this film is outstanding.... the production design is amazing!!! costumes, sets, scenery, etc. they were all perfect for me! the cinematography is beautiful, not as good as roger deakins' work with denis, but still top notch. and then hans zimmer... he does it again. not his best, but how could he? he's already made some of the best scores ever. it's a little too ambient for me at times, and i would have liked the vocals to be a little more present in the film. other than that, it's musical perfection, no complaints!!!i want to talk about one more thing, the style of denis villeneuve. denis is a filmmaker who makes his films on a basis of world building. the best example is blade runner 2049, the whole film is one big exhibition in the gigantic universe created by philip k. dick in his novel ""do androids dream of electric sheep?"".for me, that's when denis is at his best. but i missed a bit of that, it felt like dune could have felt even bigger. the whole time it felt like we could have gone a little further, just a little bit.i realize now how bad my review sounds, i'm just pointing out some things that bothered me a bit. i love the movie, and always will!!! i'm still figuring out if i think it's a masterpiece, but for now, i'll leave it for discussion.",9

"2640","dune"," an immersive sci-fi cinema experience to behold","obsessivecinemadisorder",2021-10-11,"dune is an epic science-fiction adventure experience to behold. director denis villeneuve transports the audience inside the epic world of frank herbert's novel. it is an intoxicating film, at times overwhelming, that lingers in the mind like a reoccurring dream.paul atreides, son of planet calaban, accompanies his family, house atreides, to the desert planet arrakis to manage the mining for the ""spice"", the most precious resource in the universe capable of prolonging human life, enhancing intelligence and can fuel faster-than-light space travel.a betrayal pushes the house atreides to join the freeman, the local desert inhabitants of arrakis, in a war against the harkonnens, an industrialized race seizing control of the spice.denis villeneuve spends the first 30 minutes introducing the different planets, races and characters. it takes brainpower to keep up with it and remembering all the sci-fi names of who's who, but slowly and firmly all the little details pull you inside the world of dune.it came like an awakening. i viscerally felt immersed around the 30-35 minute mark when timoth√©e chalamet's paul atreides catches an object in his hand and i cheered. just like that, i was in.before that moment, the commercial film-goer inside me, all corn-fed on the marvel formula, was throbbing going, ""where's the action scene? what's taking so long?"" the film calmed that fever down with its slow pacing, ensuring every detail was crucial and every object in frame had a story behind it, which denis villeneuve gives the audience the time to ponder on what they might be. eventually i tuned in and was immersed, feeling like i too was going on the adventure in the desert as well.greig fraser's cinematography combined with the production design and costumes, are breathtakingly gorgeous. if it's available, see it on imax. there's so much to soak up. it is addictive marveling at all the visual details, if you let it. even the spice looks so visually delicious that it makes you want to put your face in it and snort it all.hans zimmer, a self-professed huge fan of the novel, delivers his most experimental score yet, including inventing new instruments, playing normal instruments differently and creating an alien language to create otherworldly music from another universe.zimmer's score attacks the subconscious without words and he experiments with what's recognizable to our ears. there's an instance of bagpipes playing over a ceremonial setting that was masterfully jarring that had me discussing with friends the effect it had in our heads.the only one quibble i had was one instance where mandarin chinese was used as a coded language and it took me out because i speak it. it was so jarring that i missed the actual plot point. ""what? mandarin exists in the dune world?"" that is twice now denis villeneuve used chinese awkwardly in a movie, his first being arrival. he seems passionate about featuring the language, but unaware how it is playing to its native speakers.above all the spectacle, what struck me was how dune tapped into the metaphysical. paul atreides' visions call to him, driving him towards his destiny. it's an unexplainable yet compelling feeling and denis villeneuve presents it in such an ethereal untouchable way, my mind keeps thinking about it.this is the best time i've had in a cinema for 2021 and i'm rooting to see nominations come awards season. dune is the anti-formula, the anti-marvel attempt to deliver a new experience that cannot easily be explained. for me, dune hits the standard of cinema that martin scorsese was talking about.i cannot wait for part two.",9
"2641","dune"," spectacular, but without a soul.","johannes2000-1",2021-09-17,"i read the book a lifetime ago, so i don't remember the exact details, only that i was pretty overwhelmed by its epic scope. i guess the makers of this movie aimed to evoke the same feeling. and although i was totally ready to go for this, it unfortunately turned into a slightly disappointing experience.sure, it's cinematographic awesome, the cgi and special effects are top-notch, the settings and costumes are impressive, and the acting by all major characters is great. but there should be more to a movie than ""just"" all that. what i dearly missed was some kind of soul in the story, an urgency for all the goings-on that should have been transferred to me as viewer.what didn't help was the extremely complicated background of the story, that only in (rather incomprehensible) bits and pieces was revealed during the run. neither did help the fact that none of the characters was even remotely sympathetic, not even paul, who as the meant-to-be pivotal hero of the story all the time stayed composed, solemn and rather bland.what you get is a mixture of got, star wars or lotr, with the same well known ingredients: there are some evil powers that mercilessly suppress; a downtrodden community that rebells but lacks a leader; and a messianic hero that stands up to save the day; all of this covered by the usual sauce of exotic fantasy-languages, semi-religious rituals, some sorcery, and lots of massive battle-forces fighting each other to death. it's all familiar and done before, maybe not as grandiose as here, but in my opinion with a little bit more insight and depth.after two and a half hours i was left with the impression that i had only watched a long, complicated and slightly incomprehensible introduction to the real thing. maybe that real thing is already in the making, they certainly alluded to it with the subtitle ""part one"". i do hope so for timoth√©e chalamet, i admit that i could watch his face for hours, but i so much had wished for him a more rewarding role to put his teeth in. he really earns a second chance.",7

1) it suffers from what i call the ""revenant/interstellar"" malaise with too many slow ""scenic cinematographic porn"" scenes and protracted slow motion overlayed with an ""epic"" score. could have easily shaved 20 mins of the movie and made it more easily consumable to the general audience2) lack of exposition. yes! for once we could have used more exposition. why is the spice so important? there are a few mentions, but not to the degree that it deserves.3) consequently, a few scenes showing the emperor, the landsraad, the guild and the homeworlds (not just the oceans of caladan, but their architecture, the pollution of giedi prime, the splendor of caitain) to better immerse the viewer in the setting.4) i didn't expect got british dialects, but the overly americanized parts of the dialogue stood out. not in a good way.and finally
5) i freaking loved the movie, but i had a sense that my non-dunie friends had a hard time following the many threads and slow plot of the movie.conclusion:

"2654","dune"," poetry!!","remy_azhary",2021-09-16,"here's my thoughts on dune. but first and foremost, i must apologize if i put in spoilers in which i might not realize it or unintentionally. so sorry about that.so with that said...wow! what can i say!villeneuve's dune is definitely way way different from the lynch's version. it's not as weird or boring as that. nor was it as wooden or overly-dramatic as the 2000s scyfy series.the whole experience of it was somewhat, i would say, poetic yet serious in the likes of christopher nolan's ""the dark knight"" trilogy especially when it's augmented with hans zimmer's score.i would also like to highlight that there was a tinge of the 2015 justin kurzel's ""macbeth"" where the atmosphere at times felt grim and gloomy. but that's not a bad thing. it just adds to the seriousness of the movie. speaking of macbeth, the movie does give off that shakespearean quality about it which i very much appreciate it; hence why i thought this villenueve's dune is rather 'poetic'.before going into the movie, i was afraid that it be a snooze-fest just as villeneuve's take on his ""blade runner 2049"" despite it being visually stunning. but as a fan of the books, i'm certainly glad that it was far from boring. i don't feel like it is in any way a slow burn as what some reviewers described it. the pacing was just right like it was right out the book. yet i couldn't say the same for those who are unfamiliar with the story. they might, i worry, get very impatient with it.and not to give anything away or spoilers, there were definitely changes from the source material. in particular, that dining room scene from the book where disagreements were expressed out among the characters was not in the movie. another point to take note was the use of spoken languages among the various groups which i don't ever recall herbert used in the book. such that, they actually took the effort in creating languages to distinguish which group of characters they're from. it was interesting take that dr yueh was speaking in mandarin while conversing with paul and the latter responded with the same. i mean 'yueh' is, after all, a chinese name so i think it's kinda appropriate. i also picked up some arabic in some of the scenes especially when the fremens were talking to themselves.as for performances, it is definitely timothee chalamet's shining achievement. this is his movie. rebecca furgeson also gave her possibly emotionally wrenching performance. there were scenes whereby i could empathize with her pain, not as a bene gesserit, but as paul's mother. oscar isaac, too, was compelling and had me convinced that he was good enough to be paul's father. collectively, both isaac and furgeson played it excellently well as paul's parents to give him enough care yet with firm sternness to protect their son.the scope of the movie was indeed epic in terms of the scale. for example, the sizes of the heighliners in comparisons to the smaller ships. those were massive. think those individual alien attacker crafts in ""independence day"" compared to the main mothership, except that the latter was three to four times larger. and those ornithopters were perfectly made to mimic dragonflies yet upon closer look they do resemble helicopters. the costumes were stunning. so much so that i'd described them as being ""lyrical"", if that makes sense.hans zimmer's score is also worth mentioning. it fits the movie perfectly but it does not overpower the feel of any scenes. although i did find his use of bagpipes to be out of place. and sadly, we did not get to see gurney halleck strum his baliset. it'd be interesting to see how josh brolin would sound like if he were to sing.for me, personally, the only thing that was amiss was the exclusion of the emperor since he was mentioned many times throughout the movie but with no physical representation of himself on screen. and as many of us already knew, feyd was not included in the movie and it did give the strange feeling that the main harkonnen players were around except for him. or count fenring, for that matter.yet, all in all, they did capture the gist of the book so i'm not disappointed at all. dune was a beautifully made film that i wouldn't mind going for a second viewing. and i could certainly see that it would garner quite a substantial amount of nominations especially in the technical categories.",10

"2661","dune"," great movie","evy-99201",2021-09-20,"it's an extremely beautiful movie, more slow paced than the average movie but i was never bored. i liked that it took time with the characters. like blade runner 2049, it's not for everyone. but you know, no good adaptation of dune was ever going to be for everyone. it's actually a good sign i think. let's just say that if transformers is your idea of the perfect movies, you might want to skip this one but i think most of us know that. also, the lightning is unusual in the movie, in some scenes. it's all about natural light so if you like everything in a scene perfectly lit and visible it might bother you a little. i personally thought it made the movie look very ""artsy"" (not a bad thing btw)other than that, music was amazing, acting was amazing, special effects were pretty convincing the sandworms were so well-done! their entrance was epic!the only thing that stops it from getting a perfect score for me is that i kinda like the most outlandish and original design in science fiction works. this one is very realistic and grounded, but i understand why it was made that way and it doesn't stop it from being impressive and gorgeous. in fact, some people might prefers this more realistic universe, it's a matter of taste. it's such a small nitpick really when compared to the positive elements of the movie.also, it needs to be seen in theatre, trust me. i can't ever imagine seeing it for the first time on my tv. what a shame it would be! i'm probably going to see it again while it's still in theatre.ps- looking at the reviews with the lowest score and the users who posted them, it's clear that many mcu fans are salty and trying to get back at denis for his (very tame) comment about marvel movies. really you guys? did you read the full interview in context? i love many marvel movies as well (going to watch shang-chi next week!), but i thought he had a point and there was nothing i found offensive about his comment. it was not all negative as some people made it sound. let's not be petty shall we? you are allowed to like both dune and marvel.",9

"2663","dune"," a modern masterpiece - brilliant direction, exceptional visuals, incredible score, great cast","rannynm",2021-10-22,"i love dune. this film is almost like an introduction to a great story. when at the end zendaya's character says, ""this is only the beginning,"" the foreshadowing tells me that there will hopefully be a sequel.dune is an exceptional film directed by denis villeneuve and adapted from the original sci-fi novel, written by frank herbert and published in 1965. fans of the 1984 version directed by david lynch - and newcomers to dune -- will be fascinated to see villeneuve's incarnation. i absolutely love the cast, cinematography, cgi, makeup and many other aspects of this film.the film takes place on an unfamiliar desert planet, arrakis - the world of arrakis is breathtaking. i love the culture of the planet, such as the languages they speak, the homes the characters live in, and, of course, the makeup and costumes have a huge effect on the aesthetic of this planet. the story centers on a young man named paul atreides (timoth√©e chalamet) who has an important role: his family is responsible for mining a very valuable and powerful spice, which is the most precious element on arrakis. as the story unfolds, it's easy to be captivated and mesmerized into the illusion that you as the audience are with the characters on arrakis. at times, though, i felt i was almost missing parts of the story. since this is an adaptation from a book, a lot of information has to be left out, and i left the theater wanting to know more about arrakis. i also felt that the beginning is a bit slow and most of the action in this film takes place near the end, although that isn't a huge issue for me.now let's talk about the acting and this great ensemble cast with timoth√©e chalamet in the lead role and his peers: zendaya, rebecca ferguson, jason momoa, oscar issac and many others. i've been a huge fan of timoth√©e chalamet for a long time and this is one of his best performances to date. i love his character - you can really see how at the beginning of the movie he is a vulnerable yet strong boy who eventually stands his ground and knows his place. i also love zendaya's performance; throughout the entire movie i was waiting to see her appearance. i also love jason momoa's character, another one of my favorites. finally, oscar issac and rebecca ferguson work really well together and deliver very engaging performances.the costumes are very detailed and intricate which bring out fascinating elements of the planet. and the cinematography (by greig fraser) and visual storytelling is so beautifully done and goes in perfect sync with the production design. it's important to acknowledge hans zimmer who composed all the music since his score brings the sci-fi storytelling to life.the message of the film is we all have a purpose, we should find our own voice and destinies and true empathy is as powerful as blood lineage in our world.i give dune 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. i highly recommend seeing it in imax if you can. by zoe c., kids first!",10

""dune"" differs a lot from some other sci-fi movies, because it has a good balance between action scenes and dramatic moments. speaking about actors, i am very impressed by oscar isaac, stellan scarsgard and javier bardem acting. i am not a fan of timoth√©e chalamet, but he was also surprisingly good and organic in the role of paul. zendaya was not bad, but i think that the role of chani is not for her. maybe the only thing that i didn't like, that the movie was too long and some moments wasn't very important and could be easily cut out. also it feels like denis villeneuve wanted to make a film exactly according to the book and there's one problem that he didn't have enough courage to create something new and original. but nevertheless i am quite satisfied with ""dune"" (2021) and it is definitely a must-watch movie.",8

"2688","dune"," mesmerizing, but incomplete","ottovonb",2021-10-14,"it's no surprise to anyone walking into dennis villeneuve's dune that it is only part 1 of the story. the title implies a very different kind of missing ingredient. but let's rewind.first, kudos to all involved for, at long last, the definitive screen depiction of frank herbert's gargantuan sci-fi classic. finally, a creative team is able not only to merely hint at, but do justice to a dense plot and long list of players, all while keeping the audience's jaws sagging to the floor throughout most of the runtime. as most other viewers have already mentioned, this is spectacle on a very rare scale, and you would be well advised to view this on the biggest screen possible, in 2d.dune is the story of a galactic power struggle for arrakis, the desert planet home to the spice melange essential to interstellar travel. they who control the spice, control the universe. as the film opens, house harkonen fall out of favor (or do they?) and stewardship of arrakis is handed to the noble house atreides (but to what end?). there, young paul, the heir to the latter house, discovers his role in the galactic chess-game, and his unexpected calling as a futuristic messiah.upon watching dune, all the usual hallmarks of a dennis villeneuve production are again present and accounted for: top-notch casting, world-building and performances. whereas the expansive nature of the story initially had me wondering why the decision was made to go with a theatrical project (rather than, say, a generously endowed hbo or netflix miniseries), watching the canadian auteur at work, it is clear that if dune belongs anywhere else than on the page, it is on the big screen. the faults, so far, lie largely with the source itself.the greatest hurdle in connecting emotionally with this film is that paul, despite total commitment by chalamet, is hard to relate to once his destiny becomes more clearly traced out. this makes the once controversial decision to beef up the characters of lady jessica (ferguson) and chani (zendaya) all the more essential and understandable. though their actions thus far in no way betray the herbert tome, they, especially rebecca ferguson, become our emotional anchors, and perhaps the film could have weighed this consideration even more heavily.dune is awe-inspiring, its designs are fantastic, but it is rarely touching, or emotionally engaging. and somehow, hans zimmer managed to drop the ball, churning out generic percussion and throaty wails yet depriving us of a single, memorable cue.still, by rights this ought to be the real post-pandemic rallying cry back to the silver screen, and it is very possible indeed that part ii will even surpass and transcend it.",8

i don't think i've ever been so impressed in front of a movie. the visual of the film is amazing. the attention to detail and the realism of the world portrayed on screen is impressive. i was more than once impressed and gripped to my seat in front of some visuals (especially those related to the sandworm). the special effects, the way of filming and the precision on some details allow a total immersion in the world of dune. you could almost touch the quicksand with your fingers.the sandworm is definitely the best visual thing i've seen. the realism of the sand waves created by the worm is astounding and gives a real sense of danger and wonder. in fact, the film creates the necessary tension around this creature. i had never been especially terrified or fascinated by the worm before seeing this movie.i also particularly liked the richness of the fremen universe that this film shows. the different equipments used to survive in the desert make it possible to understand the hostility of the environment as well as why the fremen are dangerous and particular because they have managed to adapt and live with the desert not just in terms of climate but in term equipments. these are the kind of details that enrich the universe.sound:
sound does not have the musical function it often has in films. it is a real prop to immerse the viewer in the universe, underlining an action, a noise and the like. the rumblings, tremors, pulses felt make the world of dune alive, captivating and make it a real 4dx experience in a normal theater.story:
the story of the film is very well constructed. the director takes the time to set the scene, introduce the universe and put the characters in their comfort zone before launching the plot. this time given to the exposure of the world and the characters allows the audience to understand the issues at hand, to know the different relationships and what is going on in the minds of the characters (mainly the character of paul).the film builds a palpable but subtle tension throughout its first arc which leads us to the mid-film climax. the pace doesn't slow down after that. the film subtly and dynamically alternates action scenes with more poised ones. the action is present and well paced without being omnipresent and does not suffocate the audience with endless sequences without emotions. the film is understandable for everyone. it takes the time to present the different political factions and the issues while maintaining a little mystery about some political actors.the ending, although very open, fit with the story told in this first part and gives a feeling of accomplishment of a quest while making the audience understand that nothing is finished, far from there.characters:
all characters serve their purpose. the ones that revolve around the atreides are specially well written. each has their own personality, function and relationship to other characters. the acting combined with the writing allows the audience to become attached to these various characters, to understand them, to have empathy for them and to fear for their lives.the main character, paul atreides, is written with a lot of subtlety, complexity and emotion. everything is done, including the acting, so that the audience understands and sympathizes with this affectionate teenager, still immature and lacking in self-confidence, who is aware he must grow up and try to live up to his position as heir to a duke. this complicated period between childhood and adulthood is well portrayed on screen. to this gradually comes to add an understanding of his difference. and the audience feels a great pity to see him progressively become someone he doesn't want to be and be thrown into a path he doesn't want to take.lady jessica, the film's second leading role, embodies with great charisma and subtlety the mysterious aura of her order. alternately self-confident, emotional, stoic and badass, she is a complex character that is still a little mysterious but terribly human and understandable. the mother and son bond is also well exploited on the screen.the harkonnen are not caricatured but frightening and cruel.conclusion:
dune by denis villeneuve is a very good film, even an excellent film. it is rare to succeed in combining visual, sound and storyline without it being to the detriment of one of these elements. it's also complicated to make an adaptation of a book that satisfies both readers and non-readers. and this bet was successful. non-readers will not understand everything at 100%, but the film gives them enough to understand most of what it says. the rest can remain a mystery, understandable after a second viewing or when part 2 airs.after all, when the first star wars came out, not everyone understood what the jedi, the force, the emperor and the like were, but that didn't stop us from enjoying the adventure. here, since the film is intended to be more political and immersive, the audience has a lot more information and explanations.dune is a real sci-fi rodeo. it is a science fiction movie, a greek tragedy, an art's movie and a blockbuster. this is an immersive and psychological experience that will not leave the audience untouched.",10
"2691","dune"," visually stunning but mostly about setting the stage","byron-15",2021-09-17,"i'm a long time fan of the dune universe. have read all the books multiple times and of course i've seen lynch's version. this version is a lot better. excellent world building, visually stunning and full of star power. it moves slow, which on the plus side gives it the chance to go into detail, but on the negative side means by the end it's not even at the halfway point of the first book. so it ends at the moment the mythology is just picking up. which made me leave the cinema wishing to see part two, which unfortunately they haven't even started filming.so imho the reviews giving this movie a 10 or calling it the movie of the year are overly positive. it's a visually stunning start to a potentially mind blowing universe, but mainly an introduction to that universe. maybe when the story is finished (wouldn't surprise me if they need three movies for the first book) it will be mind blowing and perfect, but for now this movie is a great introduction to the duneverse. good, but not great. yet.",8

"2700","dune"," an empty masterpiece","stevensino",2021-09-29,"denis has filmed the unfilmable, he achieved a monumental task yet at the same time it feels like an empty achievement. bear in mind that i'm writing from the perspective of one who has read the books quite a few times, i know the events and characters and i'm just observing the way its adapted. the film's highest points are when there is action and spectacle, it's grandiose bigger than life and in a cinema it feels realistic. that feeling of realism is present in the books and it was treated well. the sets are all believable we could almost touch them, the most important set is of course the desert and its presence is surely felt. costume design also follows the same principle of groundedness, it is one of the strongest points of the film, the sight of the bene gesserit is simply haunting, the dresses of jessica are all memorable, and the star of the show is the fremen stillsuit they nailed it.with such a strong cast we expect very powerful performances and the actors surely deliver, my favourite was definitely duke leto interpreted by oscar isaac, he plays well both the charismatic leader and the caring loving father and husband. personally, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, although the sound design is very very effective especially in a cinema. the soundtrack is huge, maybe too huge for my taste i found it quite distracting and it overstayed its welcome. there are different themes for each character or trait (honour, atreides, bene gesserit, shai-hulud) but they were too obvious and very preachy.and so when all these cinematic elements combine they do create an unforgettable experience, but unforgettable for the wrong reasons or more precisely the wrong aspects. i did not see any of the ideas of the book manifested with image and sound, i only saw the images described in the book. the action and even the climax all happen in the background in the book because that's not the pint of the story, while here it's the opposite. key scenes of character introductions and interactions are taken out in favour of more dreamy sequences and action. this shift of focus made many characters feel insignificant and i never cared for any of them, it's like everyone is a side character.i really appreciated the attention to small details, like the bull painting, desert mouse, glowglobes...
this the best dune we're ever going to get, it's an audio-visual masterpiece, but it never felt nearly as thought provoking as the book or even as a standalone film.",8

"2704","midsommar"," an unnecessary long and boring remake of the wicker man and the wicker tree","abisio",2019-07-04,"the original wicker man (1973, with christopher lee) was not a terrifying movie until the very end but the suspense kept everybody guessing. the movie become a cult sensation (at least some of the final cuts of the film) not as an horror movie but as a metaphoric view of religion and society; there was some legends that the movie was based on real facts about pagan cults, north of uk. the wicker tree has the same original director and a very similar story but instead of a christian police we have an evangelical couple on a difficult relationship.
midsommar takes basically the couple in crisis and a couple other characters, moves them to sweden instead of uk.after a family tragedy; a girl joins her former boyfriend and some other friends, a group of grad students working on a thesis, on a visit to a sweden community to appreciate the summer solstice celebration.they meet there white dressed community; quite inclined to drugs and rituals (and strange music).ari asher already showed he prefer style over substance (and story) on hereditary (a movie that copy a lot from rosemary baby's and other horror classics) but at least that movie was shorter.it seems he loves to film but hates editing; basically in love with his own scenes. here, the continuous display of white dressed people dancing, playing instrumental music and doing strange rituals (in eternal daylight) becomes tediously repetitive without adding anything to the promised intrigue. characters reactions became so absurd that even the movie laughs about some events. clocking over 140 minutes the movie will be too slow even cutting an hour off. it is incredible that with such unnecessary length the resolution is rushed and confusing.there are couple of violent deaths shown, and a few others not. everything quite predictable and not very engaging; because the director keeps distance with the main characters avoiding any empathy. in fact it is never clear if anyone is worth saving; specially puig characters who is borderline obsessive and perhaps psychotic.in brief; there is no horror, the movie is tedious and far from entertaining. critics praised it because its pictoric values, but people run out of the cinema after a while or start snoring. skip this one and go to see something worth like the fall of the american empire",1

"2709","midsommar"," extremely disappointing!","vengeance20",2019-07-10,"from the writer & director who brought you the, ok but slow & boring hereditary comes this 2.0 version bore of a film which makes that film seem oscar worthy.i didn't exactly have high expectations of this film due to the writer & directors previous film, hereditary being pretty boring & slow. it had the same poor directional, bad cinematography & overall poor editing seen in this film, but it was ok & had some creepy things going on in it. hereditary at least was a horror film & executed that well throughout, plus it was shorter...so with that film comes another from the same writer & director, midsommar. long story short, the film is about a group of young 20 something's who head off to sweden & part take in a wicker man like cult.while i knew this already from the trailers & previews, the film had little else to go on, but you'd expect a film that is 2 hours & 22 minutes to at least have something to go on if not a lot. but the film didn't sadly. the film for 3/4 is basically the group milling about this compound, sleeping, eating, drinking, drug taking, sitting, dancing & part taking in the weird activities this cult have for them. only 1/4 of the film was horror. it's pretty sad to be honest. i felt the film was way too overloaded with the various activities you saw in the film if not extremely repetitive. the film could've been shorten down by at least 40 minutes tops, saving the rest for either a home release or keep them as deleted scenes. slow burner or not, this just took the biscuit for pacing & was more frustrating, if not annoying to watch if anything else. not entertaining.there would be a lot of scenes which dragged & dragged awkwardly for no reason, even the cut clips themselves in the said scenes. there would even be suspenseful scenes which would take forever in a day to get to the ""point"" or ""pay off"" it was ""supposedly going to until it would then cut to another scene. annoying & yet this writer & director claims this is a horror?
the opening was bad too, not very bad, but not very good either. don't get me wrong it was sinister, but it dragged & you felt it after the 3 minute mark. even the part after the phone call sequence when dani discovered her sister had killed herself & their parents via gassing from a gas exhaust from a running car dragged. you'd be sitting there thinking ""come on, just get to the point what's happening!?"" a lot of scenes did this in the film as i stated above. not to mention the scenes that did do this cheated you & lead on into nothing. the opening was 12 minutes & 30 seconds long. you get over the opening at around 5 minutes, but to see title of the film & the opening credits roll after that long seems very tedious if not ridiculous.the film itself was just filled with a lot of ""what the hell!?"" moments, even funny ones to be honest. the scenes would either be random, out of place or just badly put together with little to no narrative whatsoever. not even in the obvious in terms of narrative.annoying parts included excessive wailing, crying, yelling & nauseousness. this again has a lot to do with the pacing & poor editing this film had. even the parts which were suppose to be visually artistic got on your nerves as you just wanted them to get to the point & move on, the film travelled at a snails pace & felt way to over padded. watching slugs race to even paint dry would be more fun than this. the film didn't even scare me at all, little to no horror. the film was more annoying & bizarre even for its own good to watch. i don't get the entertainment value. there was no plot to speak of & the film simply went nowhere. it fizzled out after the first 40 minutes.however the acting was good, the gore effects were ok but nothing which in my mind would warrant an 18+ certificate from the bbfc. i seen more gore & violence in this year superhero horror film, brightburn which was only 15+. crazy.the director & writer himself claimed that hereditary wasn't his first horror, but this film was? what? ari aster said that midsommar was his first (then) going to be his first as hereditary was just a ""family drama"" type film. the statement itself couldn't be more pungent in irony as hereditary was more of a horror than this film would ever be.overall the film was flat out terrible & one the worst horror films of 2019 & one of the worst films overfall for this year alone. ari aster shouldn't make anymore of these films unless he looks at what went wrong with this one. critics, cinema snobs & rotton tomatoes especially will praise this mess for either biased views on what makes a good horror film alone, to what makes a good film in general. i disliked this film & found it to be disappointing in the extreme. 1/10",1

unfortunately, i had the privilege to watch the 2:28 version and not its director's cut, which is around 24 minutes longer. if i'm lucky, i will remedy to that!what the director seemingly failed to realize was that either you make a full-blown horror or a psychological psychedelic experience. anything in between and borrowing from either parties is most surely to fail and make some ... people laugh at it as if it was a black comedy.on a side note, it felt like a real experience and i truly hope that that don't exist out there for real.",1

""midsommar"" runs for two hours and twenty-seven minutes and in its tale of cults and potential sacrifices it looks like it might go down the same road as its predecessor in both frightening us and making us think, particularly after a beautifully built-up opening involving murder and suicide. however, once aster whisks us, and his four protagonists, off to sweden at the invitation of a swedish friend, we find ourselves in the middle of ""the wicker man"" and some very dodgy 'midsommar' festivities. actually the slow build-up here also works very nicely. aster takes his time, (well, he does have almost two and a half hours to play around with), and it's clear to anyone who has seen ""the wicker man"" or any other horror film, come to think of it, that when something seems too good to be true, it usually is and that all this chanting and mumbo-jumbo can only end badly, which, of course, it does a long time after the movies started.if i sound flippant it's because i really had high hopes for ""midsommar"" after the vastly superior ""hereditary"". nothing happens in this picture you can't predict a mile off, (even the killer closing shot is fairly obvious when you think of it). of course, things might have been different had aster a leading man who could have convinced us he was disorientated, frightened or even interested in what was going on. instead, we get jack reynor, whose performance is surely a shoo-in for next year's razzie. reynor started his career with a reasonably interesting performance in ""what richard did"" as an irish schoolboy who accidentally kills a classmate but it's been all down hill from there, culminating in this misplaced, wooden performance.as his girlfriend, florence pugh, (she of ""lady macbeth"" fame), does what she can with a one-dimensional role. indeed, this is not an actor's picture with no-one, including the usually reliable will poulter, making much of an impression. it has its moments to be sure, with aster even managing to inject some grisly humour into the proceedings and perhaps there is a good eighty minute horror movie struggling to get out but by adding an extra hour he kills it. perhaps the moral of the film is just avoid sweden in the summer because if the cults don't get you, the tics will.",4

"2759","midsommar"," a sunny nightmare","ferguson-6",2019-07-03,"greetings again from the darkness. summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. we are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker ari aster cares little for tradition. well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. his feature film debut was last year's mega-hit hereditary, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association top 10 list for 2018.hereditary was filled with darkness and dread, and mr. aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as dani (florence pugh, lady macbeth) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. during her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend christian (jack reynor, sing street) is a bit strained. the brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking dani's family. christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends.an awkward group conversation leads dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to sweden. the purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for josh (william jackson harper, ""the good place"") to work on his thesis. the other guys in the group are pelle (vilhelm blomgren) whose family in sweden is hosting the festival, and mark (will poulter, the revenant) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions.and with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. try to picture a folk horror comedy fairy tale break-up pagan cult film, which at any given time reminds of mother!, the wicker man, the wizard of oz, the village, suspiria, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. it is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. and that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. most of it is filmed outside during sweden's midnight sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for woodstock). the daylight messes with your senses and expectations. bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen.so without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to sweden mushroom trip, a waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. we also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the queen of may. of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late!ms. pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, haley lu richardson) is terrific here. her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. the excellent music from bobby krlic, better known as the haxan cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. i was so shell-shocked at the end, that i'm unable to confirm that the version of ""the sun ain't gonna shine (anymore)"" is that of the walker brothers (scott walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. director aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer pawel pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. the cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever.",7

"2762","midsommar"," excellent horror film about a cult","cinemagoer77",2019-11-25,"this is generally a disturbing film. some people say it was funny perhaps because they were uncomfortable with some scenes yet so many people were offended or hated it. so my guess is the movie made people uncomfortable. again, it was a disturbing film which many horror films are not these days. i welcomed ari's latest effort as horror is becoming non-horrific lately with so many tropes that the genre is lacking these days. the 1 star reviewers ignore the story telling, ignore any of the characters, ignore the symbolism that exists through the entire story, and ignore the creepiness of some of the sociopathic members. you should rewatch it just to see how evil their foreign friend actually is. it is atleast a 4 or 5 star minimum. i say this is a thinkers horror film because i had to rewatch twice. although the movie is gory it doesn't glorify the actions of the cult members. you get the feeling the cults are indeed the abnormalities we know they are and it's a visceral feeling to see them carry out their rituals. cults can be argued as the anti-thesis of progress/freedom and how they possess the means to attract people is just as baffling. well midsommar offered a glimpse into the cult via codependency and loss. add in charming sociopathy who tell people what they like to hear and we have some poor people who get lead into horror and loss of freedom/love. as a cult film this is atleast 8. also, the wicker man comparisons need to stop. how many posession movies are there and how many times need they be compared? cult horror is a sub-genre like zombie films are also a sub-genre. this is an excellent film about the horrors of a cult for modern times. i really think ari is becoming a true master of horror. he leaves many viewers disturbed but also with warnings and lessons about what evil really is. he does not glorify horror..rather he reveals

the lovers of bosch's twisted bodies, not kincaids pretty barns..... or the ones who prefer dali's twisted faces over monet's pretty flowers or the avid fans of
2001: a space odyssey, not apollo 13....will certainly appreciate this movie.you are the ones who'll love it and be horrified.the horrific car crash i just watched for over two hours left me feeling like i wanted to throw up. it was one of the most disturbing and messed up films i have ever seen. the description to the movie gives you no clue that this is going to be a wild and horrific psychological ride. it was disgusting and i felt like i was also tripping with the characters the entire film. i can't even put words to talk about the plot.
but, you know what? it was also beautiful. the power of this film is not only disturbing, but heartbreaking. i was so confused and nauseated i wanted to hate this film. however, i'm an artist first. i appreciate seeing things that are new and bring out emotions you didn't even knew you had. and while it brought up some bile......it also brought up inspiration. morbid.....but still inspiration.10 stars.",10

"2787","midsommar"," an unclear film about a swedish cult with strange traditions.","movieman6-413-929510",2019-08-03,"midsommar is a new horror film directed and written by ari aster, the director of hereditary.in the film, dani (florence pugh) decides after a family tragedy with her boyfriend christian (jack reynor) and his friends to go on holiday to sweden to deal with her tragedy and try to forget.
they travel to a remote swedish village where the villagers celebrate a midsummer festival during the days where the sun keeps shining. the villagers invite their american guests to join in with their traditions.
for example, the group of friends starts celebrating the traditions where they first eat, dance and get high, but with the days the traditions of the village become darker and more bloody.this film is unclear because, just like the characters in the film, you do not know what exactly the villagers are doing during their festival. with the many things that happen in the film, you as a viewer miss a form of explanation. the explanation you get in the film is conveyed in a way that is too unclear, so that you still do not understand everything clearly after the film ends. that is how some moments come across as comical
another problem with the film is that it takes too long for the dark actions to start, because the first strange moment in the film only starts after about an hour. this is how the film actually starts with a lack of clarity and also at a slow pace.this film also looks a lot like the film the wicker man from 1973 and because of the use of a bear in the film itself also something like the nicolas cage remake of the wicker man. in these films, an outsider also comes into contact with a cult and their strange habits. with this film you only got a clearer explanation as to what exactly happened in the films.
despite the film's unclear story, ari aster has portrayed the film in a beautiful way. every scene is almost clear, because the sun never sets in the film. he also makes nice use of what the movie looks like when the characters are high or when they are drugged. the film sets are also beautifully decorated with drawings and paintings of the traditions of the swedish sect and these images also give away a bit of what is going to happen in the film.
unfortunately, lesser effects have also been used, because with the dead bodies in the film you can see that they are cheap fake dolls as they used in old slasher horror films in the 1980s.because the characters themselves do not know what exactly is happening, the actors also appear somewhat unclear in the film. florence pugh does good acting in the beginning after the family tragedy that her character is experiencing. once in sweden she comes along with the rest of the cast that the american teenagers play more confused about. will poulter knows how to create some comical moments in the film, but his character sometimes disappears and then comes back a while later with new comic comments.",3

""midsommer"" has awfully little subject matter to fill up such a long film. the director, together with all the fans, will naturally claim the long periods of showing scenic footage, folklore dance/chant rituals and the effects of hallucinating herbs are essential for the atmosphere of the film, but it's incredibly tedious to sit through. especially because, let's be honest, everybody already knows what is coming. i honestly think you needn't have seen ""the wicker man"" in order to predict what'll happen.and yet, there are many praiseworthy and qualitative aspects about ""midsommar"" as well. i'm personally fascinated by the scandinavian cultures and nature, so i was immediately enthusiast about a film taking place during midsummer festivities, and thus - in sheer contrast to practically every other horror movie ever made - in broad daylight! you simply must also admire that ari aster didn't turn his film into an open-air version of ""hostel"", meaning the teenage protagonists aren't blatantly ignorant, or heading towards europe without knowing anything about the local culture. aster also put quite a lot of effort into providing the lead characters with a background and a personality.strictly horror-wise, the film is a mixed bag as well. ""midsommar"" contains a few very graphical and shocking moments, but the killings that actually matter occur off-screen. presumably for atmospheric reasons again, but it nonetheless makes my horror heart bleed. and, finally, a major disappointment compared to ""the wicker man"", i found the soundtrack. for a film that constantly features dancing and chanting, the music is unmemorable. ""the wicker man"" was practically half a musical, with legendary parts like ""the siren song"" and ""around the maypole"", and i at least expected something similar here.",5

(a pre-credit prologue gives a backstory to one of the central characters, but it really is not all that necessary to the film's plot.) while suspense is a mainstay, the script is in dire need of rewrites, some judicious editing, and, most importantly, clarity. one wonders why these lambs to the slaughter are so dense that they are incapable of catching any clues to their dangerous journey from the outset. (just looking at the artwork on the walls is more than a hint at the danger than is their destiny.) their non-plussed reactions after a particularly grisly ritual makes no sense at all. (all book sense and no common sense, as my father would have called it.) sex, youthful folly, and hallucinatory drugs can only justify so much for the lack of logic and the willingness to stay there.what the film has at its core is a strong performance by florence pugh as dani. (the director was lucky to have that lightning strike twice, as his previous film debut had a riveting lead performance by toni collette as well.) ms. puhl takes on this emotional role with a self-assured presence. she shows her characters inherent flaws, vulnerability, and her unhinged nature. jack reynor as her handsome boyfriend is an interesting foil and depicts a self-centered millennial quite accurately. as his friends, william jackson harper, vihelm blomgren, and will poulter make the most of their underwritten roles of college intellectual. laid-back foreign graduate student, and sex-driven jock, disrespectfully.visually, the film is a stunner. pawel pogorzelski's photography heightens the eerie uncertainty as he contrasts the brightly-lit countryside with the darker goings-on. (loved the 360 degree angled road trip, aerial shots, and the fluidity and multiple movements of flora during the drug-induced sessions.) along with andrea flesch's peasant tribal costumes with their intricate embroidery and bobby krlic's electronic folk-tinged atonal musical score, the look of the film resembles a pretty utopia that goes askew rather quickly.mr. aster's vision of a bizarre world keeps one's attention fixed at the atmospheric details and foregone omens, but his script that loses its way. the story becomes progressively absurd as more of the mystery is slowly revealed and the plot just leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion which caused more titters and groans than real fear and genuine scares from my movie audience.despite all of the artistry involved, midsommar is half baked horror. mr. aster's film starts off very effectively as it follows the recipe for suspense but the far-fetched story has too many overripe moments and wallows in its own pretentiousness. it's well made schlock, served piping hot. just not to my taste.",4

"2816","midsommar"," long winded, pretentious, but not mindless horror flick","breumaster",2020-02-14,"the movie beginns very slow and that's the speed over the whole playtime. when some young people travel to a nativ cult in sweden, they have no clue whats waiting for them. it's a story about a fictional teutonic cult that celebrate a nativ cult ritual, which happens to occur every 90 years. beginning with some drug intoxication, many people may guess where it ends. this is a very bright and friedly atmosphered horror movie, which becomes bloody, and visually clearly gory in several scenes. the story slowly developes and progresses over the whole playtime. the characters slide into the story deeper and deeper and that's not only because of the acting, the technical aspects of that movie allow the audience, to easily glide into the storyflow. there are many strong visual scenes, that match with a hypnotic score. so the hole movie slows the audience down while telling the story. it didn't really feel like 2 hours and 27 minutes, because i was so slowed down myself.i wouldn't call it a real new invention of the horror gere. there are some pretty good horror movies that formerly were made in scandinavia. 'midsommar' is not really an excellent movie, but also not mediocre. i've seen a bunch of compareable movies before. 'the wicker man' from 70's dealt with such a scenario close to 46 years earlier. all in all i like the atmosphere, so it's a recommendation.",7

"2818","midsommar"," perfect in every single way.","niels2765",2020-02-09,"midsommar is a 2019 horror film directed by ari aster (hereditary) and stars florence pugh and jack reynor as a dysfunctional couple who travel to sweden to visit the midsommar festival. this festival, located in a quaint swedish village quickly turns into an unsettling and violent holiday, hosted by a pagan cult.it's very hard to achieve a perfect 10/10 score from me. the film has to be perfect in every aspect, both technically, and story-wise. midsommar is a perfect film. every single act, every single scene, every single shot... is perfect. i watched this film for my second time last night, yet this time i watched the director's cut, still perfect. but just what makes this film so good?the film stays clear of horror cliches. no lazy jump scares and no stupid exposition to keep the plot going, just a genuine film, that is written brilliantly by ari aster. the film has clear inspiration from other horror films, which seems to be a common criticism among the audience members, but why should that be a criticism? the film is still original, yes it takes some plot devices from other films, and yes some shots/scenes may be inspired, but why does that matter? every film has inspirations, every film will have occasions where it may not be original. besides the point, midsommar takes these inspirations and just improves on them.florence pugh's performance is the best of this year. no argument. she is stunning. one of the best modern actresses today. she is outstanding in what may be the greatest horror film performance of all time. the rest of the class is just phenomenal. will poulter manages to bring humour into such a horrific, eerie story, and jack reynor really makes his and florence pugh's character's relationship so alive.the film's cinematography was also, the best of this year. so gorgeous, and how almost this whole film is shot in natural light, and during day time, is genius. the film leaves me in dismay and shock, despite it being a horror film, shot in the daytime. i loved the use of natural light, and the cinematography again is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. each shot gives me a sense of discomfort and manages to unsettle me. so damn creative as well. goddamnit just thinking about the cinematography makes me want to cry of happiness.the score is the best of this year easily. bobby krlic creates a score that incorporates elements of swedish folk music that proves to be horrifically hopeless. the score somehow stands out to the already unbelievable film. take a listen to the score. please. the score is so soothing, so delightful, yet behind such a disgustingly gory and disturbing film.the film's story is fantastic. a great narrative, with deeper meaning. i loved watching this film a second time. i could interpret the film any way i wanted to. the movie is a slow burn, much like ari aster's previous work hereditary (2018). i slowly watched everything go to crap, and i loved it. the film is a perfect cult movie. watch it. now.",10
"2819","midsommar"," very artistic movie about grief","sweidman-28016",2019-07-11,"midsommar review:midsommar is written and directed by ari aster, the same guy who wrote and directed hereditary (one of my favorite films), and follows a struggling couple who travel to sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. what begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult. this was my third most anticipated movie of the year. hereditary was my favorite film of last year and i think it's an absolute masterpiece. this is definitely different from what i expected to see. hereditary is a horror film about dealing with grief, and a bunch of other stuff that happens with supernatural cult stuff. i wouldn't consider midsommar a horror movie at all. i think it's more of a drama with a little thriller stuff thrown in. it's more about dani, played by florence pugh, and her failing relationship with christian, played by jack reynor, all the while trying to deal with a recent tragedy. i should add that jack reynor did a good job as a horrible boyfriend and also a shocked man discovering everything that's happening. i think it shouldn't have been marketed or branded with the horror genre. it's not a huge problem it's just that after hereditary and all the trailers for this most were probably expecting a horror movie. that being said it's not a bad movie. the plot is intriguing. it's more artistic and not for everyone. i think me and my friend were the only ones who actually enjoyed it out of everyone in the theater. most people said ""well that was stupid"" when it finished. i totally understand if anyone doesn't like it. the first hour i was debating if i liked it because nothing really happened. on an artistic level the first hour was good but not much happened. it was mostly the group getting high and sitting around before the festival. i thought everyone did a good job. will poulter played the funny one and he had many great one-liners. william jackson harper, just like his role in the good place, plays a serious guy and i enjoyed his character. he was most interested in the culture of these people. once the festival begins things start to get more interesting and there's a sense of something being off. we all know everyone there is in a cult but we're confused on what they're going to do. once the first most remotely ""scary"" part of the movie happens the rest of the ""scares"" are based mostly on shock value. one thing that might make people think this is dumb is the cult has many weird rituals that make us laugh in awkwardness. from what i read and know it was meant to be awkward so it wasn't just poorly done. i thought there were many shocking things that happen. that is all thanks to florence pugh. she is really good. they were saying that she was going full on toni collette in hereditary but i don't think those two can be compared with the whole different plots. i thought pugh portrayed a person dealing with grief perfectly. the opening tragedy scene we just hear her voice over a phone call and i thought it was just heartbreaking. the slow takes throughout, especially during that scene, added effect with some suspense and just making it like the audience is there discovering what is happening. may i add the cinematography was beautiful. it was brightly colored with pastels and there wasn't a shot, no matter how disturbing and shocking it was, that looked bad. aster wanted pretty, light colors because there aren't many horror movies that have that look. there was always a sense of peacefulness throughout. it was honestly a calming movie that also wasn't at the same time. it's a very weird tone that i liked. the very end was such an interesting sense. aster also likes a loud, beautiful song while something horrible yet joyous is happening. i really like that. the score by bobby krlic is good. once again very peaceful and really pretty at times. this is a hard movie to write a review about. it's definitely one that needs an analysis and to be honest i haven't read one yet. i might be seeing it again and i might pick up on things i didn't the first time. i know there's lots of foreshadowing with these paintings and pictures in the background and plainly there for the audience to see. i found some that i noticed later and i want to know more. overall it's a very interesting movie. ari aster went through a breakup and this is his way of writing it out on paper as he puts it. i can definitely see how that life event shaped this. that's really the meaning of the movie. life events shape our lives. if you're not one for slow paced, artistic, strange movies this isn't for you. i wouldn't recommend this to everyone. it's more aimed for a specific group. i did enjoy it, not as much as hereditary though so i guess i was expecting just a little more. not that it's bad i just had different expectations. if you plan on seeing it just don't expect a single thing. that will help for a better viewing experience.my grade: b",10

well, having to watch wicker man and some other cult movies in the genre, the storyline was somehow predictable to me while i found the pagan rituals too much as well as some unnecessary graphic scenes and typically constant idiocy of the protagonists. no sign of a plausible twist or a surprising turn. however, it was an entertaining horror flick for the weekend. 4/10",2
"2822","midsommar"," i'd rather babysit greta thunberg for two and half hours. that sounds kind of fun actually...","giraffedoor",2020-04-03,"i feel very similarly about this movie than i did with hereditary (by the same writer).i feel this could have been a majestic, compact, efficient 90 minute chiller that was a masterpiece of its genre. but sadly, this movie drowns in its own over ambition with way too much thrown at us and the ultimate effect is portentous, heavy-handed and messy.the detail in realizing the picture is certainly very impressive: the rich sense of place and local color alone could almost have made this movie worth seeing if it had been 25% shorter. in short, the thing looks fantastic and very professional (until it gets confident but i'll get to that).ari aster is... a lot like david lynch. by this i mean that he is a film maker that has a marvellous imagination, a rich mind for stories and a certain boldness that some people think has gone in horror. but he really, really needs to learn how to self edit. he is surrounded by too many yes-man (and women) for some reason. like hereditary, it's hard to verbalize exactly what is wrong with this movie because it takes the form of so many little things that wreck the mood like wrong notes in an otherwise well composed piece of music. seriously, someone who could say to him ""ari, baby, you're script, she's phenomenal! just take out this, this, this, this, that and replace this with something less convoluted and we've got gold!"".the first 20 minutes alone gave me so much to chew on: the way that tetraptych flies open like it's a preschooler's show; the way they cut away from the intense nordic winter with that phone ringing as if it were a teen comedy. the word ""scary"" twice! (show don't tell) and then something i've been seeing in more and more horror movies that really gets to me: we begin with a something horrible happening. which would be fine except it *has nothing to do with the rest of the frickin' movie*. and no, don't try to tell me that it's thematic and part of the character's journey. this movie had 150 minutes to sell this to me and i still don't buy it. dani is a bland, one dimensional character with no personality beyond feeling sorry for herself which she has every right to do, given the circumstances, but it makes for tedious cinema. she is not an interesting protagonist. that should have been chidi. he is the one character who really feels like a character, rather than target practice and the acting probably played a part in that.a better writer wouldn't have killed off dani's family. they simply would have shown that she was alienated from them but tied to them through guilt or co-dependence and used the movie to try and develop her character. the need to kill her family to untie her was a lazy move and means the movie blows its load in the first act. in short: i simply do not care about dani or her plight and by extension i really have no opinion on christian. he's just kind of there.there are other certain bizarre cinematic choices. these include a strange obsession with reflections which might have been atmospheric if they'd spaced them out more but there's two counts of this in the first act where someone talks to someone off screen but we see their reflection...if there might have been good if there were some theme of self discovery in this movie, but there really isn't any more than any movie. like i have said before, dani doesn't change or develop; she doesn't do things, things happen to her. another time, they match-cut going into one room and into another...it's so obvious they used a trick set it ruins the mood. and when the camera says ""screw it"" and goes upside down...now i'm a sucker for stylized cinematography but there needs to be a physical justification for it. maybe a character leaned back and saw the world upside down for a moment...but no...ellipsis, ellipsis, ellipsis....another issue is how it seems to be dani's story and yet we keep pulling away from her. but she annoys me so i'm not sure how much of an issue this really is.the film is a blur of excessive plot points, obnoxious characterisation and misjudged dialogue. i don't care about dani. i just don't and she is played irritatingly by pugh. i really do not care to see her in anything else but i guess we all deserve a second chance because who on earth could breathe life into this character?the thing i really like about this picture is curiously the thing everyone who likes it hates: the slow atmospheric scenes where you can't resist the sense that some unseen terror is coming. we so don't get enough of that in horror, not now, not in yesteryear. it does feel a lot like rip off of wicker man sometimes but that's it's strongest element. and that sinks in all the other stuff...on that note: you know how sometimes a movie is low budget and simple but because it's original and efficiently made it resonates with new generation after new generation. then there is a lavish, big budget remake in which so much talent goes into it but it is nowhere near as fondly remembered because it just lacked any of the finesse the first one had? i feel this movie is the grandiose, tinsel town remake to a classic that never was. i'm really hoping that one day this will get its own make-under remake. everything else is getting remade...and the ending...well, i won't spoil it but wowee i have not been ticked off at an ending so much since knock knock. i raised my middle finger to the end credits and told movie exactly what i think of it. the thing is...conceptually it could work, it really could. but the smug handling and the shameless padding of time as if the story has more to say and then doesn't really makes me feel like i am being taken for a ride by someone who convinced they're much more of a genius than they really are.in conclusion, some magnificent film making is wasted, even ruined, in a hubristic attempt to make what could have been an admirable horror movie into an exploration of the human condition. an expertly made cake with 3 grams of human excrement is still a bad cake, and that is sort of how i feel about this movie.i did stick with it for the full 150 minutes to be fair and i'm sure there was fun along the way (best sex scene ever...) but my final emotion was not boredom or frustration but white hot anger. you'll understand why when you see it. or maybe not...fudge this movie. i love that it's trying to be something beyond the cookie cutter teen scream horror but a film needs to do more than look the part.",3

"2842","midsommar"," a surrealistic look at what it means to hurt the ones you should care for","cory_j_adams",2020-01-04,"first and foremost, let me start off by saying that this film will definitely not be for everyone. most people who see this film will more than likely not understand what it's saying, which is fine. that's part of the beauty of cinema, it's subjective. and people are entitled to their own opinions.in my personal experience with this film, midsommar effected me greatly. the first time i saw it i found it bizarre and grandiose, surreal and visceral. the kind of film that is saying something, but not so loudly that it overwhelms you with it's themes. in fact, it more so invites you to discover what it's saying. and it says a lot. i saw the film 3 times in theaters and i feel like i still haven't grasped entirely what the film means because much of it is very ambiguous. ari aster is smart in the regard that he knows what we don't see is much more terrifying than what we do. with that being said, i don't know if i would necessarily categorize this film as a horror movie. it's more of a psychological drama with elements of horror. but genre is merely a pigeonhole that we place films in based on how they make us feel. regardless of genre, mr. aster has made a supremely effective look at a victim's complicated response to those who have hurt her.visually, this film is a feast for the eyes. i don't think i've seen a better looking film in 2019 (besides the lighthouse but in an entirely different fashion). it's use of color and lighting pretty much engulfs the viewer in this strange world that our protagonists have entered. it's some of the finest cinematography i've seen all year. the camerawork is very seamless and vast, as if painting a picture for us. revealing things through use of imagery is no small task, but aster and his cinematographer, pawel pogorzelski, pull this task off almost flawlessly (which is why i recommend multiple viewings of this film. it has a lot to say through its use of imagery. i'm sure there are some things i still haven't noticed and i've seen the film about 5 times now). this is awards-worthy work from this cinematographer, and i hope he gets the recognition he deserves.the costume and set design also thoroughly impress, with the small commune appearing to be a world uncorrupted by the outside. we're meant to be fascinated and fearful of this place and the design of the buildings and structures as well as the way they're presented evoke these responses effortlessly. it makes us wonder what's going on behind the walls of the sacred temples that appear so strange to us.the script for the film is also impressive, though i will say it is definitely not to the magnitude of what aster did with hereditary. but hereditary is entirely different monster altogether. that film was what i would call claustrophobic. this film is vast and wide. sparking our curiosity while also simultaneously alerting us that a certain danger lurks just beneath the bright exterior. one critic commented that this film is staged more like an opera than a horror film, and i wholeheartedly agree. this is a very well written film but instead of assaulting us with its themes it asks us to look for them ourselves. to interpret them in our own way, which is one of my favorite things about this film (though i can understand why some audiences will be turned off by this).now let me get to my favorite aspect of any film: the acting. i'll start off first with the woman at the center of it all, miss florence pugh. i've been watching her ever since i saw her impressive debut in 2016's lady macbeth, where she delivered one of the most unnerving performances i've ever seen given by an actress. here she delivers one of the most vivid performances of the year. in every scene she's in in this film, she is open and vulnerable. as if she has no where that she can hide what she's feeling. and in a way, she doesn't. she's a fountain of emotion, sometimes bursting with an energy that fills the entire screen. it's a mesmerizing performance that allows her to put her full range on display. the supporting players are also very good, with will poulter in particular being a standout for providing much needed comic relief (making this film actually surprisingly hilarious at times). jack reynor also holds his own as the manipulative boyfriend who doesn't know when to leave well enough alone. vilhelm blomgren as their native swedish friend, also impresses, his performance being sympathetic while also being entirely enigmatic. and william jackson harper (of good place fame) gives only what i can call a driven performance, advancing the plot towards the insane finale that we all know is coming.some people have said that they have found the film tedious and with a few plot holes and i can see why. some things are left ambiguous, but not outright unanswered. and i think that's the point. it's all part of what your interpretation is.regardless of it's flaws, midsommar is a complex study on grief and trauma. it will effect many viewers (some more than others), and will more than likely be a film that will be talked about years from now as a cinematic phenomenon that people will always be entranced by (similar to kubrick's the shining). and though it's not outright scary, it will unnerve you. which is almost better than being scared.",9

"2869","midsommar"," horrifically wonderful","lnineb",2019-12-09,"this is by far the best horror film i've seen in the past five or so years. i've actually seen it three times since it's release and will watch it again shortly after buying the extended version.this film isn't perfect. it could actually be a bit too long and the middle sequence after the mid-act climax is way too long for such an intense climax. with that said, there are a few things that completely make you forgive those mistakes.1. florence pugh's performance : she's absolutely amazing and captures the intricate details of a person's psyche after experiencing a traumatic event. her performance also justifies her actions later in the film. we are constantly reminded that she is broken and fragile. in that state she could be easily manipulated and should'e been nurtured instead of patronized.2. the first sequence, mid-climax and finale. like i said earlier the parts in between these sequences are a bit too long but these scenes are masterful, especially the build-up to the middle sequence. aster reminds us , in the beginning of this film , that true horror comes in the form of depression, suicide, murder and supreme lost of a loved one. the beginning scene is almost too much to watch, especially if you've experienced similar horrific acts. the mid-climax is just simply horrific. there's nothing symbolic about it. it's just something that you almost don't want to see ever again. the ending is tamer in comparison to the first two sequences but it does successfully wraps up a surreal experience in the most perfect way.3. the cinematography: the beginning of the film is dark and appropriate for the theme,but the rest of the film, almost 2-1/2 hours of it , is represented in a wash of light and colors. it literally looks too perfect , of which is exactly the feeling you should get once you meet the cult. by the end of the film the light and colors become annoying. too me that's a good thing, because, also by then, you are finding out how horrific of a setting the land is. this is a perfect way carrying out a concept through the details of a film.4. the deeper meaning: this is of course my interpretation but the deeper meaning of this film makes it a masterpiece. i've seen reviews saying that the film is unrealistic and that there is no story or mystery in the film. i actually think the exact opposite. it's unrealistic to some because it's an analogy of something that is very real . the complete disconnect we as humans have with trauma is represented clearly in this film. the story to me is about this disconnect with trauma or the lack of meaningful relationships. this is the reason someone can be drawn to cults or negative influences. the supporting characters in this film represent the everyday reactions and responses to horrific trauma by a lot of people today (ie thoughts and prayers). the main character represents the person that is truly grieving and is often left alone or made to think that their grieving is actually wrong. to me this analogy makes this film very realistic and actually more scary than other horror films.i absolutely loved this film and can't wait to watch the extended version of it. it's the well crafted, thought provoking, type of horror that we need in this day and time. 8/10",8

"2879","midsommar"," satire of religion masking as a horror film","jmholmes-73727",2019-07-05,"can a movie be creepy, funny, horrifying and enormously entertaining throughout? this is the cornucopia of delights ari aster has produced in his second offering. two ingredients that seem to have fueled his inspiration are, of course, the original british version of the. wicker man (quite an achievement itself) and the scores of friday the 13th slasher movies where groups of youngsters go on a vacation to be killed off one by one. his movie rises to the level of the first and transcends the level of the second formula. one of the most remarkable things here is the first 20 minutes or so which create a traumatic situation that causes the young couple to appear annoying and psychologically questionable - so that as the story progresses we do not have the compassion for them that would otherwise make their ordeal unbearable to watch.
important to note is that there is not one scare or ""jump moment"" in the entire movie. this is not a complaint, merely a warning to viewers who might see this as a failure, which, of course, it is not. the horror here, as it turns out, is all-pervasive and throughout all the bright sunny faces and clear landscape of the swedish countryside. it is in the cult members' drinks, their food, their soil and their beliefs. the horror is in the way they live.
hopefully swedish people with a sense of humor will not be offended by the script's locale. it would be interesting to see how the movie ""plays"" in that country's press. one comes away from it eager to avoid the next chance one gets to attend a prayer service or join a group seeking some kind of so-called enlightenment - regardless of the country.

"2910","midsommar"," when will people understand there is no such genre as ''psychological horror'' ?","shuhratglazkov",2019-08-28,"hello therei see that midsommar depends on psychological horror aspect heavily as a horror movie but the thing is we got a problem here. psychological horror can not be the main theme of a movie and can only and only be a side aspect of the movie make it better. just like the ''red room'' scene from ''scary stories to tell in the dark'' or maybe ''spahn movie ranch'' scene from ''once upon a time in hollywood''. psychological horror works with these 2 titles because in scary stories everything is just clear, you know there is something wrong and you know how that scene will end but you keep watching, it frightens you slowly and slowly. and in ouatih, the movie itself is far from what you'd call a psychological horror but spahn movie ranch scene is a standalone scene that's main focus is psychological horror that is thrown to the middle of a movie and when everything was going fine you just get that scene and it does what it is supposed to do and frightens you very well. but in such movies like ''midsommar'', aka in movies which has psychological horror as its theme, it just doesn't work because you know that there is something wrong there. let me give you a metaphorical example to understand it better. think it like you are in the universe of ''cabin in the woods'' and participating in the events as a spectator. there is a one sided mirror between you and the victims. you just watch ''scientists'' release the monsters upon the victims and they die. they were the ones who did not know that something wrong was going to happen. and in a real movie it works exactly the same; you are the audience and you know there are some stuff that is wrong but the characters in the movie don't.
and when there are some stuff wrong you just prepare yourself as the audience. unless the movie is very successful about making you feel for the characters and have some empathy for them you won't really have any psychological anxiety when something happens in the movie because you were waiting for that anyway. you knew that there were some wrong stuff happening around everywhere in the whole movie before that point so you were prepared for it. how is that supposed to give you psychological anxiety or whatever it is? also this movie is way too long and which makes it predictable because you will have time to predict every possible outcome and then pick the one that makes the most sense (which is not very hard to choose tbh). pretty sure they thought if they make the movie overly long and slow it would help to create that ''psychological horror and anxiety'' world they wanted to build for the movie but no luck, not this time.edit: forgot the sex scenes of the movie. lmao what was that cmon.. i really don't know what director was thinking when he decided to do that. everyone in my saloon was basically laughing hysterically at those scenes. they absolutely did not stand for anything else but just some great chuckles. gotta give it to it tho, was the best chuckle i had in a movie this year. i don't accept psychological horror as the main theme of a movie so this movie belongs to no genre at all. there is no mystery in the movie because movie is way too easy to predict thanks to its runtime. there is no other horror elements other than some heavy gore in 2 scenes and some ''psychological'' horror elements so it is not a horror movie as well. i don't even know what this movie is... but damn sure it is something overy long, predictable and slow.",2
"2911","midsommar"," perhaps the strangest movie of 2019","zkonedog",2020-02-03,"when the credits rolled on my ""midsommar"" watching experience, my first thought was ""that was the strangest movie i've seen in quite some time"". i probably should not have been surprised, seeing as how this was director ari aster's next project after the equally quirky ""hereditary"". while i can't go so far as to say that the strangeness of ""midsommar"" made it one of my favorite films, i did--aside from one fatal flaw--enjoy the overall experience.for a very basic overview, ""midsommar"" sees young adult dani (florence pugh) going through a hard time. her entire family is destroyed by an incredibly traumatic event, and to top things off boyfriend christian (jack reynor) is waffling within the relationship. somewhat reluctantly, christian and his fellow dissertation-searching friends invite dani on their trip to sweden to study midsommar festivals. what they all find is an experience unlike anything that has ever been witnessed.the setup in this film is generally very solid. the whole process sort of reminds me of films like ""get out"" or ""us"", where the filmmakers do a great job of creating authentic characters while surrounding them with an air of mystery. in the journey to the actual festival, all the characters here seem like they could be playing out a very believable scenario, and that makes them ultra-relatable.once at the crazy swedish festival, the film is sort of a combination of ""the village"" and ""the wicker man"". while the proceedings start off as fairly innocuous, the bizarreness of the whole thing slowly unveils itself. very well-paced in terms of not getting too crazy too fast, while also getting in enough scares/thrills to satisfy the audience.a lot of praise so far, so why the seven-star rating? because ""midsommar"" suffers from one fatal flaw:(warning: heavy spoilers ahead!)this is very much a metaphor film. if taken literally, the events make very little sense. only after looking at it from a certain lens do the pieces begin to fall into place. essentially, the entire movie is dani's grief experience of losing her family and then not being supported by her boyfriend. in order for that to ""work"", though, the film needed to make it more clear that christian was indeed a dead-beat, lame partner. in all honesty, the down-to-earth quality of the character writing might have actually hurt the film in this regard, as i never got the sense that christian was an out-and-out villain. as the film itself expressly states, ""maybe dani is being too clingy/needy?"". while surely not ultra-supportive, i just never got that sense that christian was the ""big bad"" here, and without that the overall metaphor (especially the ending) falls a bit flat.overall, though, ""midsommar"" fascinated me enough for me to give it solid marks. the major misstep described above prevented me personally from totally buying in, but i can easily see others not having that problem (provided they recognize it for the metaphor journey that it is, of course).",7

should go in with an open mind. it's a movie going experience that is very difficult to describe. ari aster film delivers on being very disturbing and gruesome but suffers from major pacing issues.the good: the cinematography, acting, colors and music are nearly flawless. it is one of the most technically stunning films you will see. the music makes the film all the more unsettling at times and the camera shots can linger for so long it begins to make you nervous. the acting is solid specifically from pugh. will poulter is funny at times and intentionally annoying as almost all his characters are. if you were expecting hereditary part 2, you may want to reconsider.while this film just gets crazier and crazier as it goes, it can be hard to forget that this story is dani's and that's where you will find what this movie is truly about. it's about an unstable relationship that decays and eventually explodes and forces a new cycle of self-discovery. you will probably need to read articles or watch videos on this movie when you come out like i did.now on to the issues. this movie is long. and i enjoy long movies. hereditary was perfectly paced but there are numerous scenes in this movie that could be trimmed down or cut. people will say it adds to the movie as a whole but some don't. also, there are supposed to be some genuinely unsettling scenes but almost everyone in the theater burst out laughing. nudity can be a hard thing to take seriously when it's showed like this, but i understand that some pagan rituals actually do that, so i understand where it's coming from. while the climax is far from as unforgettable as hereditary, the story does come full circle and will leave you with an unsettling final shot.overall, aster's sophomore film doesn't reach the heights of hereditary, but still provides much of what people loved about that movie. you will most likely walk out of the theater thinking wtf did i just watch, but that's the point. it's a film that requires multiple viewings and some research to truly appreciate. go see it to form your own opinion though because this could end up being more divisive than hereditary.",7

""midssomar"" is being loved or hated, i think it's a good movie, nothing more than that, but if i had to choose between loving and hating, i'd rather love. it is also important for the viewer to embark on the long wave to feel its tension and despair, otherwise it will be a long, boring and tiring trip.

"2983","midsommar"," another masterpiece for ari aster","jctundis",2019-07-05,"director ari aster said this was a film about dependency which he wrote during a breakup
... and it shows. but it's so much more.a commentary on religion, friendship, depression, identity -- all inside an extremely unsettling swedish folklore, sex cult, horror story. and it's funny, too! yes, all these ideas exist simultaneously in a brilliant and methodically paced film that frolics in the realm between all things kubrick and the wicker man.there are layers upon layers, clues given, and a deliberately hypnotic and hallucinigenic sensibility that lolls the senses so that the more graphic scenes of graphic horror hit with jarring impact. moreso, to me, than in aster's previous film heritary (the best film of 2018). not for fans of quick cut commercial fare, the timid or the squeamish, midsommar is a beautiful, horrifying meta-gestalt that i look forward to viewing again.",9
"2984","midsommar"," a convenient way to see a bunch of cliches","j_walking1516",2019-10-14,"the cinema was nice but that was it. i'll try to phrase it nicely below but this movie was an absolute bore and a checklist of tropes and cliches
i remember when i saw the very first preview, the day it came out andd i said ""that looks like teen based wicker man""
sitting at a lengthy 2.5 hours i was hoping for quite a deep dive of cult horror.
the cinematography was wonderful, great pans of landscapes and scenery. the location of filming was gorgeous and the frame work was excellent. all of it well directed as seems to be ari aster's forte
the lore is strangely shallow for it's length. what they had was interesting and convincing for the cult. the convictions and ideals were fun to hear about but ultimately could have been fleshed out more.
the acting was acceptable even tho all of the characters were unlikable and tremendously oblivious to any danger. character creation seems to be a weakness for ari. i do hope to see more of the female lead, florence pugh, in more roles in the future. she did great in her part but was restricted by the character.
overall, this was everything i expected it to be to a t. it's not that it was a bad movie it was just the exact formula that you would expect from the preview. and as i thought, it was essentially teen based wicker man. i feel like i've seen this movie before and nothing super new was brought to the table.
it also could have been very easily 30-40 minutes shorter.
i did enjoy it far more than hereditary. i can see why people got excited about it and i hope ari keeps pushing out big hitters to help the genre out. both his movies brought a ton of attention to the horror world and that's great! but i think i'll pass on his future movies.",3

"2995","midsommar"," a horror feel good movie about belonging","richardmolenschot",2020-02-27,"first of all: if a movie receives very low and very high scores then you know an art-film or new classic is born. and despite the sometimes gory shots, as a horror movie it actually doesn't really fit in the genre. which is refreshing.the movie delivers in the acting, as has been said many times before. and it is a psychedelic trip on one level. on the other hand, this movie is all about belonging somewhere. having an environment that is caring and loving and healthy.and that's what's so good about this movie to me. if your environment is toxic, uncaring and unhealthy, like dani's is, it is actually a lot better to be included in a society that has it's brutal rituals but definitely is loving and caring. at the end of this movie i was rooting for the swedish commune instead of dani's friends.what did help in this proces was the fact that the horror scene's weren't really scary, and, as a critical note, the special effects / grime wasn't that convincing and sometimes a bit laughable. if the effects we're of a higher level, i think i would've been more conflicted in the end.nevertheless, if you love cinema or theatre, and liked to be inspired by an out-of-the-box kinda movie, i'd definitely recommend midsommar.",8
"2996","midsommar"," brightly lit, underplayed, slow burn horror","hallelujah289",2020-02-07,"this is the first film i watched by this director. having no expectations, and not having watched his previous debut film hereditary, i was impressed with the skillful storytelling, the way the shots were staged, and the use of various cutaways and cgi effects to show the characters's states of trauma and drug induced disorientation. the cinematography and use of color is amazing, i believe filmed in hungary but set in sweden. the overexposure does lend itself to a feeling of being off kilter, as well as the smiling good humor of the swedish commune, as they distribute unknown drugs and perform terrible and disturbing rituals. all of this is very numbing and a good kind of commentary to the tolerated unease in the relationship of the principal characters dani and christian, who are on the brink of break up.the director has said the film midsommar was a way of his trying to navigate the feelings of his break up. he has said there is no specific correlation but that he most identifies with dani and that he has a lingering attachment to ""dead things,"" perhaps meaning to dead relationships. he offers no further specifics, but watching the film you get a sense of how, perhaps, those in our collective ancestral past dealt with cycles of life and death, be it by ritual or sacrifice (extremely literal in this movie), and the kind of depth of emotion that goes with those ceremonies of beginnings and ends.midsommar is one part neurotic, hyper articulate and hyper aware relationship drama, portrayed very relatably, and then one part drugged out, mythical, pagan sunshine nightmare. it at times feels it's budget with some of its editing choices and choice of cast (familiar faces who don't quit gel together), but at other times it has the look and sound of incredible filmmaking, if very sparse in the absence of more sounds, and the gore it sometimes does show exorbitantly and then other times not at all.horror isn't my genre, but i admire this film for its originality and the type of catharsis it does begin to induce. i don't think it went quite all the way for me in this department. i was expecting more. this film probably needs a very specific audience. please do appreciate it for its staging and cinematography in any case.",8

"2999","midsommar"," watch ""the wicker man"" from 1973 instead...","danedk",2019-07-03,"i suspect that reviewers who believe this movie to be the weirdest, most deranged and tripped-out film they've ever seen have not watched many movies. i recommend you watch ""the wicker man"" from 1973, alejandro jodorowsky's ""the holy mountain"" and sergei parajanov's ""the color of pomegranates"" before you watch this watered down, pretentious murk in order to get a sense of how movies can truly be mind-altering.
the ""story"" is essentially every clich√© of the slasher genre mashed together: a group of young people naively go into the wilderness (sweden, very scary place lol) and encounter messed up stuff. they each die one by one and, spoiler alert, there is a ""final girl"" who survives in the end. the rest of this clich√© story is fluff. if you think, based on the trailer, that much of this film will mirror the original wicker man, you are exactly right. there is even a big fire at the end where a guy gets burned alive.
there is a fine line between homage and rip-off and this may a great example of a film that slips over the edge into complete rip-off territory. i won't even go into all the logical loopholes in the story and the scenario, or point out that none of the customs line up at all with ancient scandinavian rituals (thus making one wonder why this even takes place in sweden to begin with, like, why couldn't this be a cult in upstate ny?) because there's no point. the script doesn't even attempt to be deep, the research here is sub-wikepedia level, and the characters are cookie-cutter types you've seen before in a million other horror movies. one logical question i would ask, however, is how come all of these people are anthropology phd students going to research scandinavian paganism but none of them speak swedish??!?!? has the writer ever even talked to someone with a phd???
all this said, florence pugh is a talented actress and does a great job with the shallow script. she transcends the material and shows that she can be a powerful dramatic actress. the cinematography is gorgeous too. the editing and sound are pitch perfect. i was especially taken by the set design, the use of furniture and quirky wall paintings to give the film a sense of intricate beauty to contrast with the horror. this is all really fabulous and the people who worked on these aspects of the film should be commended. it is all cosmetic, however. without the mask of beautiful production and a gifted actress, the director/ writer aster has absolutely nothing going on here.
""hereditary"" was a very good, solid horror film and i wonder if aster didn't rush into this sophomore effort too soon. this seems like a script he could have banged out in a night, especially since it feels like something made out of other films. it also seems that aster repeats some of the same tricks from ""hereditary""- using shocking, gaspar no√©-like violence and relying on making his audience feel uncomfortable at the sight of incongruously naked people running around. these stock images are going to get old really fast for him, he needs to work on building up to scares that really pay off.
there will be people who love this director, who are swept away by the cool style and photography of this film or who have simply never seen any of the hundreds of other movies out there with strange imagery and creepy paganism, and these people are going to think this movie is a mind-blower. that's nice, but please watch ""the wicker man"" from 1973 first before you fall in love with this dumpster fire.",1
