"1","Mechanics-Informed Autoencoder Enables Automated Detection and Localization of Unforeseen Structural Damage","Xuyang Li, Hamed Bolandi, Mahdi Masmoudi, Talal Salem, Nizar Lajnef, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Structural health monitoring (SHM) is vital for ensuring the safety and longevity of structures like buildings and bridges. As the volume and scale of structures and the impact of their failure continue to grow, there is a dire need for SHM techniques that are scalable, inexpensive, operate passively without human intervention, and customized for each mechanical structure without the need for complex baseline models. We present a novel ""deploy-and-forget"" approach for automated detection and localization of damages in structures. It is based on a synergistic combination of fully passive measurements from inexpensive sensors and a mechanics-informed autoencoder. Once deployed, our solution continuously learns and adapts a bespoke baseline model for each structure, learning from its undamaged state's response characteristics. After learning from just 3 hours of data, it can autonomously detect and localize different types of unforeseen damage. Results from numerical simulations and experiments indicate that incorporating the mechanical characteristics into the variational autoencoder allows for up to 35\% earlier detection and localization of damage over a standard autoencoder. Our approach holds substantial promise for a significant reduction in human intervention and inspection costs and enables proactive and preventive maintenance strategies, thus extending the lifespan, reliability, and sustainability of civil infrastructures.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:31:02 UTC (1,149 KB)"
"2","RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via Interactive Exploration for Robotic Manipulation","Hanxiao Jiang, Binghao Huang, Ruihai Wu, Zhuoran Li, Shubham Garg, Hooshang Nayyeri, Shenlong Wang, Yunzhu Li","Robotics (cs.RO)","Robots need to explore their surroundings to adapt to and tackle tasks in unknown environments. Prior work has proposed building scene graphs of the environment but typically assumes that the environment is static, omitting regions that require active interactions. This severely limits their ability to handle more complex tasks in household and office environments: before setting up a table, robots must explore drawers and cabinets to locate all utensils and condiments. In this work, we introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene graph (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information, such as geometry and semantics, and high-level information, such as the action-conditioned relationships between different entities in the scene. To this end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our system's capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the ACSG. We apply our system across various real-world settings in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploring and modeling environments it has never seen before. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects like Matryoshka dolls, and deformable objects like cloth.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:27:17 UTC (23,855 KB)"
"3","Retinotopic Mapping Enhances the Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks","Jean-Nicolas Jérémie, Emmanuel Daucé, Laurent U Perrinet","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Foveated vision, a trait shared by many animals, including humans, has not been fully utilized in machine learning applications, despite its significant contributions to biological visual function. This study investigates whether retinotopic mapping, a critical component of foveated vision, can enhance image categorization and localization performance when integrated into deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Retinotopic mapping was integrated into the inputs of standard off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which were then retrained on the ImageNet task. As expected, the logarithmic-polar mapping improved the network's ability to handle arbitrary image zooms and rotations, particularly for isolated objects. Surprisingly, the retinotopically mapped network achieved comparable performance in classification. Furthermore, the network demonstrated improved classification localization when the foveated center of the transform was shifted. This replicates a crucial ability of the human visual system that is absent in typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These findings suggest that retinotopic mapping may be fundamental to significant preattentive visual processes.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:15:37 UTC (33,786 KB)"
"4","Benchmarking the Robustness of Panoptic Segmentation for Automated Driving","Yiting Wang, Haonan Zhao, Daniel Gummadi, Mehrdad Dianati, Kurt Debattista, Valentina Donzella","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Precise situational awareness is required for the safe decision-making of assisted and automated driving (AAD) functions. Panoptic segmentation is a promising perception technique to identify and categorise objects, impending hazards, and driveable space at a pixel level. While segmentation quality is generally associated with the quality of the camera data, a comprehensive understanding and modelling of this relationship are paramount for AAD system designers. Motivated by such a need, this work proposes a unifying pipeline to assess the robustness of panoptic segmentation models for AAD, correlating it with traditional image quality. The first step of the proposed pipeline involves generating degraded camera data that reflects real-world noise factors. To this end, 19 noise factors have been identified and implemented with 3 severity levels. Of these factors, this work proposes novel models for unfavourable light and snow. After applying the degradation models, three state-of-the-art CNN- and vision transformers (ViT)-based panoptic segmentation networks are used to analyse their robustness. The variations of the segmentation performance are then correlated to 8 selected image quality metrics. This research reveals that: 1) certain specific noise factors produce the highest impact on panoptic segmentation, i.e. droplets on lens and Gaussian noise; 2) the ViT-based panoptic segmentation backbones show better robustness to the considered noise factors; 3) some image quality metrics (i.e. LPIPS and CW-SSIM) correlate strongly with panoptic segmentation performance and therefore they can be used as predictive metrics for network performance.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:00:06 UTC (43,849 KB)"

This work develops methods for investigating human problem-solving processes in HRE, an underexplored yet critical aspect. Since reverse engineers rely heavily on visual information, eye tracking holds promise for studying their cognitive processes. To gain further insights, we additionally employ verbal thought protocols during and immediately after HRE tasks: Concurrent and Retrospective Think Aloud. We evaluate the combination of eye tracking and Think Aloud with 41 participants in an HRE simulation. Eye tracking accurately identifies fixations on individual circuit elements and highlights critical components. Based on two use cases, we demonstrate that eye tracking and Think Aloud can complement each other to improve data quality. Our methodological insights can inform future studies in HRE, a specific setting of human-computer interaction, and in other problem-solving settings involving misleading or missing information.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 17:28:37 UTC (1,459 KB)"

We reflect on a multispecies project that negotiated an especially complex ethical approval process. Cat Royale was an artist-led exploration of creating an artwork to engage audiences in exploring trust in autonomous systems. The artwork took the form of a robot that played with three cats. Gaining ethical approval required an extensive dialogue with three Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) covering computer science, veterinary science and animal welfare, raising tensions around the welfare of the cats, perceived benefits and appropriate methods, and reputational risk to the University. To reveal these tensions we introduce beneficiary-epistemology space, that makes explicit who benefits from research (humans or animals) and underlying epistemologies. Positioning projects and IRBs in this space can help clarify tensions and highlight opportunities to recruit additional expertise.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:57:39 UTC (1,973 KB)"

Subsequently, we provide a detailed account of key moments during the deployment and discuss the design implications for future multispecies systems. Specifically, we argue that designing the technology and its interactions is not sufficient, but that it is equally important to consider the design of the `world' in which the technology operates.

In this regard, a promising paradigm considers embedding task-required invariant structures, e.g., geometric invariance, in the fundamental image representation. However, such invariant representations typically exhibit limited discriminability, limiting their applications in larger-scale trustworthy vision tasks. For this open problem, we conduct a systematic investigation of hierarchical invariance, exploring this topic from theoretical, practical, and application perspectives. At the theoretical level, we show how to construct over-complete invariants with a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-like hierarchical architecture yet in a fully interpretable manner. The general blueprint, specific definitions, invariant properties, and numerical implementations are provided. At the practical level, we discuss how to customize this theoretical framework into a given task. With the over-completeness, discriminative features w.r.t. the task can be adaptively formed in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-like manner. We demonstrate the above arguments with accuracy, invariance, and efficiency results on texture, digit, and parasite classification experiments. Furthermore, at the application level, our representations are explored in real-world forensics tasks on adversarial perturbations and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Such applications reveal that the proposed strategy not only realizes the theoretically promised invariance, but also exhibits competitive discriminability even in the era of deep learning. For robust and interpretable vision tasks at larger scales, hierarchical invariant representation can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional CNN and invariants.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:50:07 UTC (8,248 KB)"

In this paper, we present a mixed-method study to investigate characteristics of successful entrainment leading to pair and group-based synchronisation. Drawing inspiration from industrial settings, we designed a fast-paced, short-cycle repetitive task. Using motion tracking, we investigated entrainment in both dyadic and triadic task completion. Furthermore, we utilise audio-video recordings and semi-structured interviews to contextualise participants' experiences. This paper contributes to the Human-Computer/Robot Interaction (HCI/HRI) literature using a human-centred approach to identify characteristics of entrainment during pair- and group-based collaboration. We present five characteristics related to successful entrainment. These are related to the occurrence of entrainment, leader-follower patterns, interpersonal communication, the importance of the point-of-assembly, and the value of acoustic feedback. Finally, we present three design considerations for future research and design on collaboration with robots.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:42:17 UTC (18,500 KB)"
"10","Performance Analysis of Systems with Coupled and Decoupled RISs","Dominik Semmler, Josef A. Nossek, Michael Joham, Wolfgang Utschick","Information Theory (cs.IT)","We analyze and compare different methods for handling the mutual coupling in RIS-aided communication systems. A new mutual coupling aware algorithm is derived where the reactance of each element is updated successively with a closed-form solution. In comparison to existing element-wise methods, this approach leads to a considerably reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce decoupling networks for the RIS array as a potential solution for handling mutual coupling. With these networks, the system model reduces to the same structure as when no mutual coupling were present. Including decoupling networks, we can optimize the channel gain of a RIS-aided SISO system in closed-form which allows to analyze the scenario under mutual coupling analytically and to draw connections to the conventional transmit array gain. In particular, a super-quadratic channel gain can be achieved which scales as N^4 where N is the number of RIS elements.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:33:49 UTC (530 KB)"
"11","Reputational Algorithm Aversion","Gregory Weitzner","Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)","People are often reluctant to incorporate information produced by algorithms into their decisions, a phenomenon called ""algorithm aversion"". This paper shows how algorithm aversion arises when the choice to follow an algorithm conveys information about a human's ability. I develop a model in which workers make forecasts of a random outcome based on their own private information and an algorithm's signal. Low-skill workers receive worse information than the algorithm and hence should always follow the algorithm's signal, while high-skill workers receive better information than the algorithm and should sometimes override it. However, due to reputational concerns, low-skill workers inefficiently override the algorithm to increase the likelihood they are perceived as high-skill. The model provides a fully rational microfoundation for algorithm aversion that aligns with the broad concern that AI systems will displace many types of workers.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:28:55 UTC (307 KB)"

Our analysis demonstrates that while the clusters within a modified attention matrix dynamics can exhibit significant divergence from the original over extended periods, they maintain close similarities over shorter intervals, depending on the parameter differences.

Recent works explore unknown object rearrangement systems by incorporating learning-based perception modules. However, they are sensitive to perception error, and pay less attention to task-level performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective system for unknown object rearrangement amidst perception noise. We theoretically reveal the noisy perception impacts grasp and place in a decoupled way, and show such a decoupled structure is non-trivial to improve task optimality. We propose GSP, a dual-loop system with the decoupled structure as prior. For the inner loop, we learn an active seeing policy for self-confident object matching to improve the perception of place. For the outer loop, we learn a grasp policy aware of object matching and grasp capability guided by task-level rewards. We leverage the foundation model CLIP for object matching, policy learning and self-termination. A series of experiments indicate that GSP can conduct unknown object rearrangement with higher completion rate and less steps.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:05:51 UTC (11,914 KB)"
"14","Faithful Temporal Question Answering over Heterogeneous Sources","Zhen Jia, Philipp Christmann, Gerhard Weikum","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Temporal question answering (QA) involves time constraints, with phrases such as ""... in 2019"" or ""... before COVID"". In the former, time is an explicit condition, in the latter it is implicit. State-of-the-art methods have limitations along three dimensions. First, with neural inference, time constraints are merely soft-matched, giving room to invalid or inexplicable answers. Second, questions with implicit time are poorly supported. Third, answers come from a single source: either a knowledge base (KB) or a text corpus. We propose a temporal QA system that addresses these shortcomings. First, it enforces temporal constraints for faithful answering with tangible evidence. Second, it properly handles implicit questions. Third, it operates over heterogeneous sources, covering KB, text and web tables in a unified manner. The method has three stages: (i) understanding the question and its temporal conditions, (ii) retrieving evidence from all sources, and (iii) faithfully answering the question. As implicit questions are sparse in prior benchmarks, we introduce a principled method for generating diverse questions. Experiments show superior performance over a suite of baselines.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:03:17 UTC (3,944 KB)"

To improve on this situation, next-generation authentication mechanisms, based on behavioral biometric factors such as eye movement and brainwave have emerged. However, their usability remains relatively under-explored. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical user study (n=32 participants) to evaluate three brain-based and three eye-based authentication mechanisms, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our findings show good overall usability according to the System Usability Scale for both categories of mechanisms, with average SUS scores in the range of 78.6-79.6 and the best mechanisms rated with an ""excellent"" score. Participants particularly identified brainwave authentication as more secure yet more privacy-invasive and effort-intensive compared to eye movement authentication. However, the significant number of neutral responses indicates participants' need for more detailed information about the security and privacy implications of these authentication methods. Building on the collected evidence, we identify three key areas for improvement: privacy, authentication interface design, and verification time. We offer recommendations for designers and developers to improve the usability and security of next-generation authentication mechanisms.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:34:43 UTC (8,403 KB)"

We further introduce a supervisory module which has an innate understanding of physics and causality, through which it can simulate the execution of task sequences over time and store the results in a model of the environment.

Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities (e.g., mobility, manipulation, and sensing) at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission performance and safety guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new decentralized LLM-based planner that is capable of achieving high mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a decentralized fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on multi-robot home service applications. We also show through comparative experiments, that our method outperforms recent centralized and decentralized multi-robot LLM-based planners in terms of in terms of its ability to design correct plans. The advantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with increasing mission complexity and robot team size.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:02:44 UTC (25,850 KB)"

Hart","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) studies generate thousands of hours of audio, which may be used to monitor specific animal populations, conduct broad biodiversity surveys, detect threats such as poachers, and more. Machine learning classifiers for species identification are increasingly being used to process the vast amount of audio generated by bioacoustic surveys, expediting analysis and increasing the utility of PAM as a management tool. In common practice, a threshold is applied to classifier output scores, and scores above the threshold are aggregated into a detection count. The choice of threshold produces biased counts of vocalizations, which are subject to false positive/negative rates that may vary across subsets of the dataset. In this work, we advocate for directly estimating call density: The proportion of detection windows containing the target vocalization, regardless of classifier score. Our approach targets a desirable ecological estimator and provides a more rigorous grounding for identifying the core problems caused by distribution shifts -- when the defining characteristics of the data distribution change -- and designing strategies to mitigate them. We propose a validation scheme for estimating call density in a body of data and obtain, through Bayesian reasoning, probability distributions of confidence scores for both the positive and negative classes. We use these distributions to predict site-level densities, which may be subject to distribution shifts. We test our proposed methods on a real-world study of Hawaiian birds and provide simulation results leveraging existing fully annotated datasets, demonstrating robustness to variations in call density and classifier model quality.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:52:44 UTC (297 KB)"

Each of these is obtained by a localized illumination of the object, which is shifted after each illumination to cover its whole domain. As in the resulting measurements the phase information is lost, ptychography gives rise to solving a phase retrieval problem. In this work, we consider ptychographic measurements corrupted with background noise, a type of additive noise that is independent of the shift, i.e., it is the same for all diffraction patterns. Two algorithms are provided, for arbitrary objects and for so-called phase objects that do not absorb the light but only scatter it. For the second type, a uniqueness of reconstruction is established for almost every object. Our approach is based on the Wigner Distribution Deconvolution, which lifts the object to a higher-dimensional matrix space where the recovery can be reformulated as a linear problem. Background noise only affects a few equations of the linear system that are therefore discarded. The lost information is then restored using redundancy in the higher-dimensional space.

These factors also limit the performance of the well-known low-rank representation (LRR) models in terms of robustness on the separation of background and target features and the reliance on manual parameter selection. To this end, we build a new set of HAD benchmark datasets for improving the robustness of the HAD algorithm in complex scenarios, AIR-HAD for short. Accordingly, we propose a generalized and interpretable HAD network by deeply unfolding a dictionary-learnable LLR model, named LRR-Net$^+$, which is capable of spectrally decoupling the background structure and object properties in a more generalized fashion and eliminating the bias introduced by vital interference targets concurrently. In addition, LRR-Net$^+$ integrates the solution process of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimizer with the deep network, guiding its search process and imparting a level of interpretability to parameter optimization. Additionally, the integration of physical models with DL techniques eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning. The manually tuned parameters are seamlessly transformed into trainable parameters for deep neural networks, facilitating a more efficient and automated optimization process. Extensive experiments conducted on the AIR-HAD dataset show the superiority of our LRR-Net$^+$ in terms of detection performance and generalization ability, compared to top-performing rivals.

These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array (ELAA). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce iterative iterations by up to $33\%$, while also significantly improve symbol error probability by approximately an order of magnitude.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:10:41 UTC (3,635 KB)"

Moreover, as the available qubits increase, the computational complexity grows exponentially, posing additional challenges. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use qubits efficiently and mitigate both present limitations and future complexities. To address this, existing quantum applications attempt to integrate classical and quantum systems in a hybrid framework.

Comprehensive simulations showcase the framework's ability to enhance transparency, automation, scalability, and cyber-attack resilience for UAV coordination in post-disaster networks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:01:27 UTC (3,242 KB)"

Diverging from extant approaches grounded in random walk analysis or particle systems, we approach this problem through operator semigroup theory. This theoretical framework allows us to rigorously prove that oversmoothing is intrinsically linked to the ergodicity of the diffusion operator. This finding further poses a general and mild ergodicity-breaking condition, encompassing the various specific solutions previously offered, thereby presenting a more universal and theoretically grounded approach to mitigating oversmoothing in diffusion-based GNNs. Additionally, we offer a probabilistic interpretation of our theory, forging a link with prior works and broadening the theoretical horizon. Our experimental results reveal that this ergodicity-breaking term effectively mitigates oversmoothing measured by Dirichlet energy, and simultaneously enhances performance in node classification tasks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:44:57 UTC (741 KB)"
"27","Shapley Value Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Theory, Method and Its Application to Energy Network","Jianhong Wang","Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)","Multi-agent reinforcement learning is an area of rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and machine learning. One of the important questions to be answered is how to conduct credit assignment in a multi-agent system. There have been many schemes designed to conduct credit assignment by multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Although these credit assignment schemes have been proved useful in improving the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning, most of them are designed heuristically without a rigorous theoretic basis and therefore infeasible to understand how agents cooperate. In this thesis, we aim at investigating the foundation of credit assignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning via cooperative game theory. We first extend a game model called convex game and a payoff distribution scheme called Shapley value in cooperative game theory to Markov decision process, named as Markov convex game and Markov Shapley value respectively. We represent a global reward game as a Markov convex game under the grand coalition. As a result, Markov Shapley value can be reasonably used as a credit assignment scheme in the global reward game. Markov Shapley value possesses the following virtues: (i) efficiency; (ii) identifiability of dummy agents; (iii) reflecting the contribution and (iv) symmetry, which form the fair credit assignment. Based on Markov Shapley value, we propose three multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms called SHAQ, SQDDPG and SMFPPO. Furthermore, we extend Markov convex game to partial observability to deal with the partially observable problems, named as partially observable Markov convex game. In application, we evaluate SQDDPG and SMFPPO on the real-world problem in energy networks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:43:15 UTC (58,384 KB)"

An observer theory-guided deep learning architecture, called Spatiotemporal Observer, is designed for predictive learning of high dimensional data. The characteristics of the proposed framework are twofold: firstly, it provides the generalization error bound and convergence guarantee for spatiotemporal prediction; secondly, dynamical regularization is introduced to enable the model to learn system dynamics better during training. Further experimental results show that this framework could capture the spatiotemporal dynamics and make accurate predictions in both one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting scenarios.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:28:31 UTC (717 KB)"

To address this issue without the need for expensive manual data creation, we use few-shot prompting with Llama-2-70B to enhance the MultiWOZ dataset with user backstories, a typical example of chitchat interference in TODs. We assess the impact of this addition by testing two models: one trained solely on TODs and another trained on TODs with a preliminary chitchat interaction. Our analysis reveals that our enriched dataset poses a significant challenge to these systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our dataset can be effectively used for training purposes, enabling a system to consistently acknowledge the user's backstory while also successfully moving the task forward in the same turn, as confirmed by human evaluation.

In production environment, VFL usually involves one task party and one data party. Fair and economically efficient feature trading is crucial to the commercialization of VFL, where the task party is considered as the data consumer who buys the data party's features. However, current VFL feature trading practices often price the data party's data as a whole and assume transactions occur prior to the performing VFL. Neglecting the performance gains resulting from traded features may lead to underpayment and overpayment issues. In this study, we propose a bargaining-based feature trading approach in VFL to encourage economically efficient transactions. Our model incorporates performance gain-based pricing, taking into account the revenue-based optimization objectives of both parties. We analyze the proposed bargaining model under perfect and imperfect performance information settings, proving the existence of an equilibrium that optimizes the parties' objectives. Moreover, we develop performance gain estimation-based bargaining strategies for imperfect performance information scenarios and discuss potential security issues and solutions.

Thus, Transfer Learning models often prove themselves suboptimal for these tasks, even after manual finetuning. The development of architectures from scratch is oftentimes unfeasible due to the vastness of the hyperparameter space and a shortage of time, computational resources and Deep Learning experts in most biomedical research laboratories. An alternative to manually defining the models is the use of Neuroevolution, which employs metaheuristic techniques to optimize Deep Learning architectures. However, many algorithms proposed in the neuroevolutive literature are either too unreliable or limited to a small, predefined region of the hyperparameter space. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Chimera Algorithm, a novel, hybrid neuroevolutive algorithm that integrates the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm with Evolutionary Computation tools to generate models from scratch, as well as to refine a given previous architecture to better fit the task at hand. The Chimera Algorithm has been validated with two datasets of natural and medical images, producing models that surpassed the performance of those coming from Transfer Learning.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:21:03 UTC (961 KB)"

In multi-tenant LLMs serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts.

Various supervised-learning approaches have been proposed recently. However, these methods heavily depend on a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which is expensive to obtain in practice. In this study, we present a label-efficient learning approach using a pre-trained diffusion model for multi-organ segmentation tasks in CT images. First, a denoising diffusion model was trained using unlabeled CT data, generating additional two-dimensional (2D) CT images. Then the pre-trained denoising diffusion network was transferred to the downstream multi-organ segmentation task, effectively creating a semi-supervised learning model that requires only a small amount of labeled data. Furthermore, linear classification and fine-tuning decoder strategies were employed to enhance the network's segmentation performance. Our generative model at 256x256 resolution achieves impressive performance in terms of Fréchet inception distance, spatial Fréchet inception distance, and F1-score, with values of 11.32, 46.93, and 73.1\%, respectively. These results affirm the diffusion model's ability to generate diverse and realistic 2D CT images. Additionally, our method achieves competitive multi-organ segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the FLARE 2022 dataset, particularly in limited labeled data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only 1\% and 10\% labeled data, our method achieves Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 71.56\% and 78.51\% after fine-tuning, respectively.

One promising approach is to align vocal-tract parameters between adults and children through children-specific data augmentation, referred here to as ChildAugment. Specifically, we modify the formant frequencies and formant bandwidths of adult speech to emulate children's speech.

In this paper, a novel model-free Safe RL algorithm, formulated based on the multi-objective policy optimization framework is introduced where the policy is optimized towards optimality and safety, simultaneously. The optimality is achieved by the environment reward function that is subsequently shaped using a safety critic. The advantage of the Safety Optimized RL (SORL) algorithm compared to the traditional Safe RL algorithms is that it omits the need to constrain the policy search space. This allows SORL to find a natural tradeoff between safety and optimality without compromising the performance in terms of either safety or optimality due to strict search space constraints. Through our theoretical analysis of SORL, we propose a condition for SORL's converged policy to guarantee safety and then use it to introduce an aggressiveness parameter that allows for fine-tuning the mentioned tradeoff. The experimental results obtained in seven different robotic environments indicate a considerable reduction in the number of safety violations along with higher, or competitive, policy returns, in comparison to six different state-of-the-art Safe RL methods. The results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed SORL algorithm in safety-critical applications.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:58:38 UTC (1,548 KB)"

AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two modifiable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp parameter and post-chirp parameter, respectively. These parameters can be fine-tuned to avoid overlapping channel paths with different delays or Doppler shifts, leading to performance enhancement especially for doubly dispersive channel. In this paper, we propose a novel AFDM structure with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can embed additional information bits into the pre-chirp parameter design for both spectral and energy efficiency enhancement. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the application of distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process maintains the orthogonality among these subcarriers. Then, different pre-chirp parameters are flexibly assigned to each AFDM subcarrier according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, aside from classical phase/amplitude modulation, extra binary bits can be implicitly conveyed by the indices of selected pre-chirping parameters realizations without additional energy consumption. At the receiver, both a maximum likelihood (ML) detector and a reduced-complexity ML-minimum mean square error (ML-MMSE) detector are employed to recover the information bits. It has been shown via simulations that the proposed AFDM-PIM exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to classical AFDM, OFDM and IM-aided OFDM algorithms.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:32:50 UTC (384 KB)"
"53","The Flower Calculus","Pablo Donato (PARTOUT)","Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)","We introduce the flower calculus, a deep inference proof system for intuitionistic first-order logic inspired by Peirce's existential graphs. It works as a rewriting system over inductive objects called ""flowers"", that enjoy both a graphical interpretation as topological diagrams, and a textual presentation as nested sequents akin to coherent formulas. Importantly, the calculus dispenses completely with the traditional notion of symbolic connective, operating solely on nested flowers containing atomic predicates. We prove both the soundness of the full calculus and the completeness of an analytic fragment with respect to Kripke semantics. This provides to our knowledge the first analyticity result for a proof system based on existential graphs, adapting semantic cut-elimination techniques to a deep inference setting. Furthermore, the kernel of rules targetted by completeness is fully invertible, a desirable property for both automated and interactive proof search.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:13:22 UTC (165 KB)"
"54","Platforms for Efficient and Incentive-Aware Collaboration","Nika Haghtalab, Mingda Qiao, Kunhe Yang","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Collaboration is crucial for reaching collective goals. However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the strategic behavior of individual agents -- a fact that is captured by a high Price of Stability (PoS) in recent literature [Blum et al., 2021]. Implicit in the traditional PoS analysis is the assumption that agents have full knowledge of how their tasks relate to one another. We offer a new perspective on bringing about efficient collaboration among strategic agents using information design. Inspired by the growing importance of collaboration in machine learning (such as platforms for collaborative federated learning and data cooperatives), we propose a framework where the platform has more information about how the agents' tasks relate to each other than the agents themselves. We characterize how and to what degree such platforms can leverage their information advantage to steer strategic agents toward efficient collaboration. Concretely, we consider collaboration networks where each node is a task type held by one agent, and each task benefits from contributions made in their inclusive neighborhood of tasks. This network structure is known to the agents and the platform, but only the platform knows each agent's real location -- from the agents' perspective, their location is determined by a random permutation. We employ private Bayesian persuasion and design two families of persuasive signaling schemes that the platform can use to ensure a small total workload when agents follow the signal. The first family aims to achieve the minmax optimal approximation ratio compared to the optimal collaboration, which is shown to be $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for unit-weight graphs, $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ for graphs with constant minimum edge weights, and $O(n^{3/4})$ for general weighted graphs. The second family ensures per-instance strict improvement compared to full information disclosure.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:04:23 UTC (62 KB)"

While cognitive science emphasizes the significance of spatial context in the formation and retrieval of episodic memory, the current primary approach to implementing episodic memory in AI systems is through transformers that store temporally ordered experiences, which overlooks the spatial dimension. As a result, it is unclear how the underlying structure could be extended to incorporate the spatial axis beyond temporal order alone and thereby what benefits can be obtained. To address this, this paper explores the use of Spatially-Aware Transformer models that incorporate spatial information. These models enable the creation of place-centric episodic memory that considers both temporal and spatial dimensions. Adopting this approach, we demonstrate that memory utilization efficiency can be improved, leading to enhanced accuracy in various place-centric downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Memory Allocator, a memory management method based on reinforcement learning that aims to optimize efficiency of memory utilization. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model in various environments and across multiple downstream tasks, including prediction, generation, reasoning, and reinforcement learning.

In many realistic scenarios, a number of agents need to maximize multiple submodular objectives over the same ground set. We study such a setting, where the different solutions must be disjoint, and thus, questions of fairness arise. Inspired from the fair division literature, we suggest a simple round-robin protocol, where agents are allowed to build their solutions one item at a time by taking turns. Unlike what is typical in fair division, however, the prime goal here is to provide a fair algorithmic environment; each agent is allowed to use any algorithm for constructing their respective solutions. We show that just by following simple greedy policies, agents have solid guarantees for both monotone and non-monotone objectives, and for combinatorial constraints as general as $p$-systems (which capture cardinality and matroid intersection constraints). In the monotone case, our results include approximate EF1-type guarantees and their implications in fair division may be of independent interest. Further, although following a greedy policy may not be optimal in general, we show that consistently performing better than that is computationally hard.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 07:37:05 UTC (389 KB)"

For example, homophenes, words that share identical lip movements but produce different sounds, can be distinguished by considering the context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Visual Speech Processing incorporated with LLMs (VSP-LLM), to maximize the context modeling ability by bringing the overwhelming power of LLMs. Specifically, VSP-LLM is designed to perform multi-tasks of visual speech recognition and translation, where the given instructions control the type of task. The input video is mapped to the input latent space of a LLM by employing a self-supervised visual speech model. Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual speech units. Through the proposed deduplication and Low Rank Adaptors (LoRA), VSP-LLM can be trained in a computationally efficient manner. In the translation dataset, the MuAViC benchmark, we demonstrate that VSP-LLM can more effectively recognize and translate lip movements with just 15 hours of labeled data, compared to the recent translation model trained with 433 hours of labeld data.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 07:21:32 UTC (552 KB)"

As a countermeasure, existing studies leverage provenance graphs to capture the complex relations between system entities in a host for effective APT detection. In addition to detecting single attack events as most existing work does, understanding the tactics / techniques (e.g., Kill-Chain, ATT&CK) applied to organize and accomplish the APT attack campaign is more important for security operations. Existing studies try to manually design a set of rules to map low-level system events to high-level APT tactics / techniques. However, the rule based methods are coarse-grained and lack generalization ability, thus they can only recognize APT tactics and cannot identify fine-grained APT techniques and mutant APT attacks. In this paper, we propose TREC, the first attempt to recognize APT tactics / techniques from provenance graphs by exploiting deep learning techniques. To address the ""needle in a haystack"" problem, TREC segments small and compact subgraphs covering individual APT technique instances from a large provenance graph based on a malicious node detection model and a subgraph sampling algorithm. To address the ""training sample scarcity"" problem, TREC trains the APT tactic / technique recognition model in a few-shot learning manner by adopting a Siamese neural network. We evaluate TREC based on a customized dataset collected and made public by our team. The experiment results show that TREC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems in APT tactic recognition and TREC can also effectively identify APT techniques.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 07:05:32 UTC (4,866 KB)"

The proposed method possesses a unique capability: it seamlessly integrates SciML into UQ and vice versa, which allows it to quantify the uncertainties in SciML tasks effectively and leverage SciML for improved uncertainty assessment during UQ-related tasks. The proposed surrogate model can effectively incorporate a variety of physical constraints, such as governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with associated initial and boundary conditions constraints, inequality-type constraints (e.g., monotonicity, convexity, non-negativity, among others), and additional a priori information in the training process to supplement limited data. This ensures physically realistic predictions and significantly reduces the need for expensive computational model evaluations to train the surrogate model.

However, their potential in domain-specific MT remains under-explored. Current LLM-based MT systems still face several challenges. First, for LLMs with in-context learning, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to input translation examples, and processing them can increase inference costs. They often require extra post-processing due to over-generation. Second, LLMs with fine-tuning on domain-specific data often require high training costs for domain adaptation, and may weaken the zero-shot MT capabilities of LLMs due to over-specialization. The aforementioned methods can struggle to translate rare words in domain transfer scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a prompt-oriented fine-tuning method, denoted as LlamaIT, to effectively and efficiently fine-tune a general-purpose LLM for domain-specific MT tasks. First, we construct a task-specific mix-domain dataset, which is then used to fine-tune the LLM with LoRA. This can eliminate the need for input translation examples, post-processing, or over-specialization. By zero-shot prompting with instructions, we adapt the MT tasks to the target domain at inference time. To further elicit the MT capability for rare words, we construct new prompts by incorporating domain-specific bilingual vocabulary. We also conduct extensive experiments on both publicly available and self-constructed datasets. The results show that our LlamaIT can significantly enhance the domain-specific MT capabilities of the LLM, meanwhile preserving its zero-shot MT capabilities.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 02:24:15 UTC (3,007 KB)"

Current approaches circumvent the lack of high-quality labeled data in non-English languages by leveraging multilingual pretrained language models capable of cross-lingual transfer. However, these models require substantial task-specific fine-tuning across multiple languages, often perform poorly in languages with minimal representation in the pretraining corpus, and struggle to incorporate new languages after the pretraining phase. In this work, we present a novel modular dense retrieval model that learns from the rich data of a single high-resource language and effectively zero-shot transfers to a wide array of languages, thereby eliminating the need for language-specific labeled data.

ISAC provides integration gain via sharing spectrum, hardware, and software. However, concerns exist regarding its sensing performance when compared to dedicated radar systems. To address this issue, the advantages of widely deployed networks should be utilized, and this paper proposes networked collaborative sensing (NCS) using multi-domain measurements (MM), including range, Doppler, and two-dimension angle of arrival. In the NCS-MM architecture, this paper proposes a novel multi-domain decoupling model and a novel guard band-based protocol. The proposed model simplifies multi-domain derivations and algorithm designs, and the proposed protocol conserves resources and mitigates NCS interference. To determine the performance limits, this paper derives the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of three-dimension position and velocity in NCS-MM. An accumulated single-dimension channel model is used to obtain the CRLB of MM, which is proven to be equivalent to that of the multi-dimension model. The algorithms of both MM estimation and fusion are proposed. An arbitrary-dimension Newtonized orthogonal matched pursuit (AD-NOMP) is proposed to accurately estimate grid-less MM.

We consider a setting where a robot is initially equipped with (1) a library of parameterized skills, (2) an AI planner for sequencing together the skills given a goal, and (3) a very general prior distribution for selecting skill parameters. Once deployed, the robot should rapidly and autonomously learn to improve its performance by specializing its skill parameter selection policy to the particular objects, goals, and constraints in its environment. In this work, we focus on the active learning problem of choosing which skills to practice to maximize expected future task success. We propose that the robot should estimate the competence of each skill, extrapolate the competence (asking: ""how much would the competence improve through practice?""), and situate the skill in the task distribution through competence-aware planning. This approach is implemented within a fully autonomous system where the robot repeatedly plans, practices, and learns without any environment resets. Through experiments in simulation, we find that our approach learns effective parameter policies more sample-efficiently than several baselines.

Most existing works, however, focus on improving the accuracy of the model, not the calibration performance which is another important requirement for trustworthy AI systems. Temperature scaling (TS), an accuracy-preserving post-hoc calibration method, has been proven to be effective in in-domain settings, but not in out-of-domain (OOD) due to the difficulty in obtaining a validation set for the unseen domain beforehand. In this paper, we propose consistency-guided temperature scaling (CTS), a new temperature scaling strategy that can significantly enhance the OOD calibration performance by providing mutual supervision among data samples in the source domains. Motivated by our observation that over-confidence stemming from inconsistent sample predictions is the main obstacle to OOD calibration, we propose to guide the scaling process by taking consistencies into account in terms of two different aspects -- style and content -- which are the key components that can well-represent data samples in multi-domain settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy outperforms existing works, achieving superior OOD calibration performance on various datasets. This can be accomplished by employing only the source domains without compromising accuracy, making our scheme directly applicable to various trustworthy AI systems.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 23:36:18 UTC (452 KB)"

Dhillon","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Recommendation algorithms play a pivotal role in shaping our media choices, which makes it crucial to comprehend their long-term impact on user behavior. These algorithms are often linked to two critical outcomes: homogenization, wherein users consume similar content despite disparate underlying preferences, and the filter bubble effect, wherein individuals with differing preferences only consume content aligned with their preferences (without much overlap with other users). Prior research assumes a trade-off between homogenization and filter bubble effects and then shows that personalized recommendations mitigate filter bubbles by fostering homogenization. However, because of this assumption of a tradeoff between these two effects, prior work cannot develop a more nuanced view of how recommendation systems may independently impact homogenization and filter bubble effects. We develop a more refined definition of homogenization and the filter bubble effect by decomposing them into two key metrics: how different the average consumption is between users (inter-user diversity) and how varied an individual's consumption is (intra-user diversity). We then use a novel agent-based simulation framework that enables a holistic view of the impact of recommendation systems on homogenization and filter bubble effects. Our simulations show that traditional recommendation algorithms (based on past behavior) mainly reduce filter bubbles by affecting inter-user diversity without significantly impacting intra-user diversity. Building on these findings, we introduce two new recommendation algorithms that take a more nuanced approach by accounting for both types of diversity.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 23:12:20 UTC (196 KB)"

Markovic, Shashi Shekhar","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","Given multi-category point sets from different place-types, our goal is to develop a spatially-lucid classifier that can distinguish between two classes based on the arrangements of their points. This problem is important for many applications, such as oncology, for analyzing immune-tumor relationships and designing new immunotherapies. It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches. We explore a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly uses different training strategies, including weighted-distance learning rate and spatial domain adaptation, on various place-types for spatially-lucid classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., MxIF oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 21:22:21 UTC (18,939 KB)"
"79","What comes after optical-bypass network? A study on optical-computing-enabled network","Dao Thanh Hai","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","A new architectural paradigm, named, optical-computing-enabled network, is proposed as a potential evolution of the currently used optical-bypass framework. The main idea is to leverage the optical computing capabilities performed on transitional lightpaths at intermediate nodes and such proposal reverses the conventional wisdom in optical-bypass network, that is, separating in-transit lightpaths in avoidance of unwanted interference. In optical-computing-enabled network, the optical nodes are therefore upgraded from conventional functions of add-drop and cross-connect to include optical computing / processing capabilities. This is enabled by exploiting the superposition of in-transit lightpaths for computing purposes to achieve greater capacity efficiency. While traditional network design and planning algorithms have been well-developed for optical-bypass framework in which the routing and resource allocation is dedicated to each optical channel (lightpath), more complicated problems arise in optical-computing-enabled architecture as a consequence of intricate interaction between optical channels and hence resulting into the establishment of the so-called integrated / computed lightpaths. This necessitates for a different framework of network design and planning to maximize the impact of optical computing opportunities. In highlighting this critical point, a detailed case study exploiting the optical aggregation operation to re-design the optical core network is investigated in this paper. Numerical results obtained from extensive simulations on the COST239 network are presented to quantify the efficacy of optical-computing-enabled approach versus the conventional optical-bypass-enabled one.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 21:13:12 UTC (171 KB)"

Craig Watkins, Christopher Winship","Applications (stat.AP)","We are interested in developing a data-driven method to evaluate race-induced biases in law enforcement systems. While the recent works have addressed this question in the context of police-civilian interactions using police stop data, they have two key limitations. First, bias can only be properly quantified if true criminality is accounted for in addition to race, but it is absent in prior works. Second, law enforcement systems are multi-stage and hence it is important to isolate the true source of bias within the ""causal chain of interactions"" rather than simply focusing on the end outcome; this can help guide reforms. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a multi-stage causal framework incorporating criminality. We provide a theoretical characterization and an associated data-driven method to evaluate (a) the presence of any form of racial bias, and (b) if so, the primary source of such a bias in terms of race and criminality. Our framework identifies three canonical scenarios with distinct characteristics: in settings like (1) airport security, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be bias in law enforcement against innocents of that race; (2) AI-empowered policing, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be bias in law enforcement against criminals of that race; and (3) police-civilian interaction, the primary source of observed bias against a race could be bias in law enforcement against that race or bias from the general public in reporting against the other race. Through an extensive empirical study using police-civilian interaction data and 911 call data, we find an instance of such a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in New Orleans, the observed bias is against the majority race and the likely reason for it is the over-reporting (via 911 calls) of incidents involving the minority race by the general public.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 20:41:43 UTC (2,826 KB)"

However, most of these studies are performed assuming an ideal situation, while in reality, we can have measurement noise, DC offset, and variations in the voltage signal's amplitude and frequency. Building on the prior PQE classification works using deep learning, this paper proposes a deep-learning framework that leverages attention-enabled Transformers as a tool to accurately classify PQEs under the aforementioned considerations. The proposed framework can operate directly on the voltage signals with no need for a separate feature extraction or calculation phase. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms recently proposed learning-based techniques. It can accurately classify PQEs under the aforementioned conditions with an accuracy varying between 99.81%$-$91.43% depending on the signal-to-noise ratio, DC offsets, and variations in the signal amplitude and frequency.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 20:09:58 UTC (708 KB)"

These challenges necessitate the development of advanced perception systems and motion planning algorithms capable of managing situations of considerable complexity. Although the end-to-end AD method utilizing LiDAR sensors has achieved significant success in this scenario, we argue that its drawbacks may hinder its practical application. Instead, we propose the vision-centric AD as a promising alternative offering a streamlined model without compromising performance. In this study, we present a path planning method that utilizes 2D bounding boxes of objects, developed through imitation learning in urban driving scenarios. This is achieved by integrating high-definition (HD) map data with images captured by surrounding cameras. Subsequent perception tasks involve bounding-box detection and tracking, while the planning phase employs both local embeddings via Graph Neural Network (GNN) and global embeddings via Transformer for temporal-spatial feature aggregation, ultimately producing optimal path planning information. We evaluated our model on the nuPlan planning task and observed that it performs competitively in comparison to existing vision-centric methods.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 19:34:56 UTC (903 KB)"

To this extent, the development of new methods is needed to ensure fast and accurate fault localization and, hence, strengthen power system reliability. This paper proposes a data-driven ground fault location method for the power distribution system. An 11-bus 20 kV power system is modeled in Matlab/Simulink to simulate ground faults. The faults are generated at different locations and under various system operational states. Time-domain faulted three-phase voltages at the system substation are then analyzed with discrete wavelet transform. Statistical quantities of the processed data are eventually used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to find a mapping between computed voltage features and faults. Specifically, three ANNs allow the prediction of faulted phase, faulted branch, and fault distance from the system substation separately. According to the results, the method shows good potential, with a total relative error of 0,4% for fault distance prediction. The method is applied to datasets with unknown system states to test robustness.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:25:32 UTC (407 KB)"

However, designing a mechanism that satisfies certain kinematic or quasi-static requirements is a challenging task. The kinematic requirements may include the workspace of a mechanism, while the quasi-static requirements of a mechanism may include its torque transmission, which refers to the ability of the mechanism to transfer power and torque effectively. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based generative model for generating multiple crank-rocker four-bar linkage mechanisms that satisfy both the kinematic and quasi-static requirements aforementioned. The proposed model is based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with modifications for mechanism synthesis, which is trained to learn the relationship between the requirements of a mechanism with respect to linkage lengths. The results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully generates multiple distinct mechanisms that satisfy specific kinematic and quasi-static requirements. To evaluate the novelty of our approach, we provide a comparison of the samples synthesized by the proposed cGAN, traditional cVAE and NSGA-II. Our approach has several advantages over traditional design methods. It enables designers to efficiently generate multiple diverse and feasible design candidates while exploring a large design space. Also, the proposed model considers both the kinematic and quasi-static requirements, which can lead to more efficient and effective mechanisms for real-world use, making it a promising tool for linkage mechanism design.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 03:31:00 UTC (1,458 KB)"

While compute-in-memory (CIM) approaches can address the so-called memory-wall (i.e. energy dissipated due to repeated memory read access) they are agnostic to the energy dissipated due to repeated memory writes at the precision required for training (the update-wall), and they don't account for the energy dissipated when transferring information between short-term and long-term memories (the consolidation-wall). The LIM paradigm proposes that these bottlenecks, too, can be overcome if the energy barrier of physical memories is adaptively modulated such that the dynamics of memory updates and consolidation match the Lyapunov dynamics of gradient-descent training of an AI model. In this paper, we derive new theoretical lower bounds on energy dissipation when training AI systems using different LIM approaches. The analysis presented here is model-agnostic and highlights the trade-off between energy efficiency and the speed of training. The resulting non-equilibrium energy-efficiency bounds have a similar flavor as that of Landauer's energy-dissipation bounds. We also extend these limits by taking into account the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) used for training, the size of the AI model, and the precision of the training parameters. Our projections suggest that the energy-dissipation lower-bound to train a brain scale AI system (comprising of $10^{15}$ parameters) using LIM is $10^8 \sim 10^9$ Joules, which is on the same magnitude the Landauer's adiabatic lower-bound and $6$ to $7$ orders of magnitude lower than the projections obtained using state-of-the-art AI accelerator hardware lower-bounds.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 21:02:11 UTC (6,516 KB)"

More generally, anticipating a tipping point at which the system transitions from one stable steady state to another is relevant to a broad range of fields. We develop a machine-learning approach to predicting tipping in noisy dynamical systems with a time-varying parameter and test it on a number of systems including the AMOC, ecological networks, an electrical power system, and a climate model.

The biases are consistent across 42 prompt templates and several models, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents. While providing numerical, decision-relevant anchors in the prompt can successfully counteract the biases, qualitative details have inconsistent effects and may even increase disparities.

This complexity arises from the need to handle a wide range of document types, often characterized by semi-structured forms. Semi-structured documents present a fixed set of data without a fixed format. As a consequence, a template-based solution cannot be used, as understanding a document requires the extraction of the data structure.

In order to make human intervention easy and consistent, we introduce automatic detection of low interest and engagement to provide explicit takeover prompts to the remote operator. We implement this semi-autonomous system which detects takeover points for the operator and compare it to fully tele-operated and fully autonomous attentive listening systems. We find that the semi-autonomous system is generally perceived more positively than the autonomous system.

However, SOME/IP lacks a robust security architecture, making it susceptible to potential attacks. Besides, random hardware failure of ECU will disrupt SOME/IP communication. In this paper, we propose SISSA, a SOME/IP communication traffic-based approach for modeling and analyzing in-vehicle functional safety and cyber security. Specifically, SISSA models hardware failures with the Weibull distribution and addresses five potential attacks on SOME/IP communication, including Distributed Denial-of-Services, Man-in-the-Middle, and abnormal communication processes, assuming a malicious user accesses the in-vehicle network. Subsequently, SISSA designs a series of deep learning models with various backbones to extract features from SOME/IP sessions among ECUs. We adopt residual self-attention to accelerate the model's convergence and enhance detection accuracy, determining whether an ECU is under attack, facing functional failure, or operating normally. Additionally, we have created and annotated a dataset encompassing various classes, including indicators of attack, functionality, and normalcy.

As these advanced generative models increasingly form collaborative networks for complex tasks, the integrity and security of these systems are crucial. Our paper, ``The Wolf Within'', explores a novel vulnerability in MLLM societies - the indirect propagation of malicious content. Unlike direct harmful output generation for MLLMs, our research demonstrates how a single MLLM agent can be subtly influenced to generate prompts that, in turn, induce other MLLM agents in the society to output malicious content. This subtle, yet potent method of indirect influence marks a significant escalation in the security risks associated with MLLMs. Our findings reveal that, with minimal or even no access to MLLMs' parameters, an MLLM agent, when manipulated to produce specific prompts or instructions, can effectively ``infect'' other agents within a society of MLLMs. This infection leads to the generation and circulation of harmful outputs, such as dangerous instructions or misinformation, across the society. We also show the transferability of these indirectly generated prompts, highlighting their possibility in propagating malice through inter-agent communication. This research provides a critical insight into a new dimension of threat posed by MLLMs, where a single agent can act as a catalyst for widespread malevolent influence.

This term refers to the unexpected and potentially harmful responses generated by LLMs when prompted with malicious questions. Existing research focuses on generating jailbreak prompts but our study aim to answer a different question: Is the system message really important to jailbreak in LLMs? To address this question, we conducted experiments in a stable GPT version gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to generated jailbreak prompts with varying system messages: short, long, and none. We discover that different system messages have distinct resistances to jailbreak by experiments.

To generate system messages that are more resistant to jailbreak prompts, we propose System Messages Evolutionary Algorithms (SMEA).

We demonstrate that attackers can significantly boost an item's exposure by merely altering its textual content during the testing phase, without requiring direct interference with the model's training process. Additionally, the attack is notably stealthy, as it does not affect the overall recommendation performance and the modifications to the text are subtle, making it difficult for users and platforms to detect.

To address this problem, this paper will provide a new approach by analyzing the EHG signals, which are recorded on the abdomen of the mother during labor and pregnancy. The EHG signal reflects the electrical activity that induces the mechanical contraction of the myometrium. Because EHGs are known to be non-stationary signals, and because we anticipate connectivity to alter during contraction, we applied the windowing approach on real signals to help us identify the best windows and the best nodes with the most significant data to be used for classification. The suggested pipeline includes i) divide the 16 EHG signals that are recorded from the abdomen of pregnant women in N windows; ii) apply the connectivity matrices on each window; iii) apply the Graph theory-based measures on the connectivity matrices on each window; iv) apply the consensus Matrix on each window in order to retrieve the best windows and the best nodes. Following that, several neural network and machine learning methods are applied to the best windows and best nodes to categorize pregnancy and labor contractions, based on the different input parameters (connectivity method alone, connectivity method plus graph parameters, best nodes, all nodes, best windows, all windows). Results showed that the best nodes are nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; while the best windows are 2, 4, and 5. The classification results obtained by using only these best nodes are better than when using the whole nodes. The results are always better when using the full burst, whatever the chosen nodes. Thus, the windowing approach proved to be an innovative technique that can improve the differentiation between labor and pregnancy EHG signals.","Sat, 10 Feb 2024 17:59:12 UTC (1,820 KB)"

The manifestation of such biases could systematically delay essential medical care for certain patient subgroups. In this study, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models in chest X-ray diagnosis across five globally-sourced datasets. Our findings reveal that compared to board-certified radiologists, these foundation models consistently underdiagnose marginalized groups, with even higher rates seen in intersectional subgroups, such as Black female patients. Such demographic biases present over a wide range of pathologies and demographic attributes. Further analysis of the model embedding uncovers its significant encoding of demographic information.

Lau","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Practical large language model (LLM) services may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across numerous requests. However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t. the sequence length. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts. Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms. Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (i.e., key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens. RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:58:28 UTC (21,563 KB)"

In this paper, we propose DLM: a Decision Language Model for RMABs. To enable dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies for challenging public health settings using human-language commands, we propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose code reward functions for a multi-agent RL environment for RMABs, and (3) iterate on the generated reward using feedback from RMAB simulations to effectively adapt policy outcomes. In collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based public health organization promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, we conduct a simulation study, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human language commands as input.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:58:27 UTC (857 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Feb 2024 22:17:10 UTC (809 KB)"
"102","Link Prediction under Heterophily: A Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Network Approach","Andrea Giuseppe Di Francesco, Francesco Caso, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Fabrizio Silvestri","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","In the past years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the `de facto' standard in various deep learning domains, thanks to their flexibility in modeling real-world phenomena represented as graphs. However, the message-passing mechanism of GNNs faces challenges in learnability and expressivity, hindering high performance on heterophilic graphs, where adjacent nodes frequently have different labels. Most existing solutions addressing these challenges are primarily confined to specific benchmarks focused on node classification tasks. This narrow focus restricts the potential impact that link prediction under heterophily could offer in several applications, including recommender systems. For example, in social networks, two users may be connected for some latent reason, making it challenging to predict such connections in advance. Physics-Inspired GNNs such as GRAFF provided a significant contribution to enhance node classification performance under heterophily, thanks to the adoption of physics biases in the message-passing. Drawing inspiration from these findings, we advocate that the methodology employed by GRAFF can improve link prediction performance as well. To further explore this hypothesis, we introduce GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF to link prediction. We evaluate its efficacy within a recent collection of heterophilic graphs, establishing a new benchmark for link prediction under heterophily. Our approach surpasses previous methods, in most of the datasets, showcasing a strong flexibility in different contexts, and achieving relative AUROC improvements of up to 26.7%.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:56:31 UTC (188 KB)"
"103","Causal Imputation for Counterfactual SCMs: Bridging Graphs and Latent Factor Models","Alvaro Ribot, Chandler Squires, Caroline Uhler","Machine Learning (stat.ML)","We consider the task of causal imputation, where we aim to predict the outcomes of some set of actions across a wide range of possible contexts. As a running example, we consider predicting how different drugs affect cells from different cell types. We study the index-only setting, where the actions and contexts are categorical variables with a finite number of possible values. Even in this simple setting, a practical challenge arises, since often only a small subset of possible action-context pairs have been studied. Thus, models must extrapolate to novel action-context pairs, which can be framed as a form of matrix completion with rows indexed by actions, columns indexed by contexts, and matrix entries corresponding to outcomes. We introduce a novel SCM-based model class, where the outcome is expressed as a counterfactual, actions are expressed as interventions on an instrumental variable, and contexts are defined based on the initial state of the system. We show that, under a linearity assumption, this setup induces a latent factor model over the matrix of outcomes, with an additional fixed effect term. To perform causal prediction based on this model class, we introduce simple extension to the Synthetic Interventions estimator (Agarwal et al., 2020). We evaluate several matrix completion approaches on the PRISM drug repurposing dataset, showing that our method outperforms all other considered matrix completion approaches.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:37:33 UTC (6,933 KB)"
"104","Environment Semantic Communication: Enabling Distributed Sensing Aided Networks","Shoaib Imran, Gouranga Charan, Ahmed Alkhateeb","Information Theory (cs.IT)","Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communication systems require large antenna arrays and use narrow directive beams to ensure sufficient receive signal power. However, selecting the optimal beams for these large antenna arrays incurs a significant beam training overhead, making it challenging to support applications involving high mobility. In recent years, machine learning (ML) solutions have shown promising results in reducing the beam training overhead by utilizing various sensing modalities such as GPS position and RGB images. However, the existing approaches are mainly limited to scenarios with only a single object of interest present in the wireless environment and focus only on co-located sensing, where all the sensors are installed at the communication terminal. This brings key challenges such as the limited sensing coverage compared to the coverage of the communication system and the difficulty in handling non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these limitations, our paper proposes the deployment of multiple distributed sensing nodes, each equipped with an RGB camera. These nodes focus on extracting environmental semantics from the captured RGB images. The semantic data, rather than the raw images, are then transmitted to the basestation. This strategy significantly alleviates the overhead associated with the data storage and transmission of the raw images. Furthermore, semantic communication enhances the system's adaptability and responsiveness to dynamic environments, allowing for prioritization and transmission of contextually relevant information. Experimental results on the DeepSense 6G dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing the sensing data transmission overhead while accurately predicting the optimal beams in realistic communication environments.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:24:30 UTC (6,514 KB)"

However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs remains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life dialogues. To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dialogues. By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data, we construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns across 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. We then evaluate 21 popular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both ability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs performance across dialogue turns within various tasks. Further analysis indicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific designs has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs. Extensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the corresponding multi-turn abilities.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:21:59 UTC (1,258 KB)"

Hobbs","Robotics (cs.RO)","As the space domain becomes increasingly congested, autonomy is proposed as one approach to enable small numbers of human ground operators to manage large constellations of satellites and tackle more complex missions such as on-orbit or in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing. One of the biggest challenges in developing novel spacecraft autonomy is mechanisms to test and evaluate their performance. Testing spacecraft autonomy on-orbit can be high risk and prohibitively expensive. An alternative method is to test autonomy terrestrially using satellite surrogates such as attitude test beds on air bearings or drones for translational motion visualization. Against this background, this work develops an approach to evaluate autonomous spacecraft behavior using a surrogate platform, namely a micro-quadcopter drone developed by the Bitcraze team, the Crazyflie 2.1. The Crazyflie drones are increasingly becoming ubiquitous in flight testing labs because they are affordable, open source, readily available, and include expansion decks which allow for features such as positioning systems, distance and/or motion sensors, wireless charging, and AI capabilities. In this paper, models of Crazyflie drones are used to simulate the relative motion dynamics of spacecraft under linearized Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics in elliptical natural motion trajectories, in pre-generated docking trajectories, and via trajectories output by neural network control systems.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:09:17 UTC (8,181 KB)"

Current automatic TCT screening systems mostly involve abnormal cervical cell detection, which generally requires large-scale and diverse training data with high-quality annotations to achieve promising performance. Pathological image synthesis is naturally raised to minimize the efforts in data collection and annotation. However, it is challenging to generate realistic large-size cytopathological images while simultaneously synthesizing visually plausible appearances for small-size abnormal cervical cells. In this paper, we propose a two-stage image synthesis framework to create synthetic data for augmenting cervical abnormality screening.

In the second Local Cell Editing stage, normal cells are randomly selected from the generated images and then are converted to different types of abnormal cells using the proposed Abnormal Cell Synthesizer. Both Normal Image Generator and Abnormal Cell Synthesizer are built upon the pre-trained Stable Diffusion via parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for customizing cytopathological image contents and extending spatial layout controllability, respectively.

The AP-UE association and power control both are important problems in their own right in distributed mMIMO networks to improve scalability and reduce front-haul load of the network, and to enhance the system performance by mitigating the interference and boosting the desired signals, respectively. Unlike previous studies, which focused primarily on addressing the AP-UE association or power control problems separately, this work addresses the uplink sum-throughput maximization problem in distributed mMIMO networks by solving the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, while maintaining Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements for each UE. To improve scalability, we present an l1-penalty function that delicately balances the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and front-haul signaling load. Our proposed methodology leverages fractional programming, Lagrangian dual formation, and penalty functions to provide an elegant and effective iterative solution with guaranteed convergence while meeting strict QoS criteria. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed technique for maximizing sum-throughput while considering the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, demonstrating its superiority over approaches that address these problems individually. Furthermore, the results show that the introduced penalty function can help us effectively control the maximum front-haul load for uplink distributed mMIMO systems.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:47:43 UTC (331 KB)"

SCADA systems are prone to cyberattacks, posing risks to critical infrastructure. As there is a lack of host-based intrusion detection systems specifically designed for the stable nature of SCADA systems, the objective of this work is to propose a host-based intrusion detection system tailored for SCADA systems in smart grids. The proposed system utilizes USB device identification, flagging, and process memory scanning to monitor and detect anomalies in SCADA systems, providing enhanced security measures. Evaluation in three different scenarios demonstrates the tool's effectiveness in detecting and disabling malware. The proposed approach effectively identifies potential threats and enhances the security of SCADA systems in smart grids, providing a promising solution to protect against cyberattacks.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 14:47:42 UTC (1,078 KB)"

Al-Kadi","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Education is a dynamic field that must be adaptable to sudden changes and disruptions caused by events like pandemics, war, and natural disasters related to climate change. When these events occur, traditional classrooms with traditional or blended delivery can shift to fully online learning, which requires an efficient learning environment that meets students' needs. While learning management systems support teachers' productivity and creativity, they typically provide the same content to all learners in a course, ignoring their unique learning styles. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning approach that detects students' learning styles using a data mining technique. We use the commonly used Felder Silverman learning style model and demonstrate that our semi-supervised method can produce reliable classification models with few labeled data. We evaluate our approach on two different courses and achieve an accuracy of 88.83% and 77.35%, respectively. Our work shows that educational data mining and semi-supervised machine learning techniques can identify different learning styles and create a personalized learning environment.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 11:56:49 UTC (3,437 KB)"

Object detection is one such algorithm that is compute-hungry. In this context, we make the following contributions: (i) Fast Fruit Detector (FFD), a resource-efficient, single-stage, and postprocessing-free object detector based on our novel latent object representation (LOR) module, query assignment, and prediction strategy. FFD achieves 100FPS@FP32 precision on the latest 10W NVIDIA Jetson-NX embedded device while co-existing with other time-critical sub-systems such as control, grasping, SLAM, a major achievement of this work. (ii) a method to generate vast amounts of training data without exhaustive manual labelling of fruit images since they consist of a large number of instances, which increases the labelling cost and time. (iii) an open-source fruit detection dataset having plenty of very small-sized instances that are difficult to detect. Our exhaustive evaluations on our and MinneApple dataset show that FFD, being only a single-scale detector, is more accurate than many representative detectors, e.g. FFD is better than single-scale Faster-RCNN by 10.7AP, multi-scale Faster-RCNN by 2.3AP, and better than latest single-scale YOLO-v8 by 8AP and multi-scale YOLO-v8 by 0.3 while being considerably faster.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 14:44:50 UTC (3,123 KB)"

When shifting the focus to the effects of digital systems on societies, we are forced to consider all the anticipated outcomes, both desirable and undesirable ones. Unfortunately, the mainstream research has ignored, to a large extent, the potential threats, and unwanted outcomes, of digitalization, which makes the efforts to change software businesses to be more sustainable, difficult to succeed.

Creating an HD Map requires a huge amount of on-road and off-road data. Typically, these raw datasets are collected and uploaded to cloud-based HD map service providers through vehicular networks. Nevertheless, there are challenges in transmitting the raw data over vehicular wireless channels due to the dynamic topology. As the number of vehicles increases, there is a detrimental impact on service quality, which acts as a barrier to a real-time HD Map system for collaborative driving in Autonomous Vehicles (AV). In this paper, to overcome network congestion, a Q-learning coverage-time-awareness algorithm is presented to optimize the quality of service for vehicular networks and HD map updates. The algorithm is evaluated in an environment that imitates a dynamic scenario where vehicles enter and leave.

While there is salient success in recent AV architectures, hinging on the advancements in AI models, there is a growing number of fatal incidents that impedes full AVs from going mainstream. This calls for the need to revisit the fundamentals of building safety-critical AV architectures. However, this direction should not deter leveraging the power of AI. To this end, we propose Savvy, a new trustworthy intelligent AV architecture that achieves the best of both worlds. Savvy makes a clear separation between the control plane and the data plane to guarantee the safety-first principles. The former assume control to ensure safety using design-time defined rules, while launching the latter for optimizing decisions as much as possible within safety time-bounds. This is achieved through guided Time-aware predictive quality degradation (TPQD): using dynamic ML models that can be tuned to provide either richer or faster outputs based on the available safety time bounds. For instance, Savvy allows to safely identify an elephant as an obstacle (a mere object) the earliest possible, rather than optimally recognizing it as an elephant when it is too late. This position paper presents the Savvy's motivations and concept, whereas empirical evaluation is a work in progress.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 07:24:45 UTC (264 KB)"

We begin by formalizing the problem setting and use the text descriptions of bias groups to establish an unsafe direction for guiding the diffusion process. Next, we simplify the problem into a weight optimization problem and attempt a Reinforcement solver, Policy Gradient, which shows sub-optimal performance with slow convergence.

The surge in traffic has strained backhaul links and backbone networks, prompting the exploration of caching solutions at the edge router. Existing work primarily relies on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for caching issues, assuming fixed-time interval decisions; however, real-world scenarios involve random request arrivals, and despite the critical role of various file characteristics in determining an optimal caching policy, none of the related existing work considers all these file characteristics in forming a caching policy. In this paper, first, we formulate the caching problem using a semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to accommodate the continuous-time nature of real-world scenarios allowing for caching decisions at random times upon file requests. Then, we propose a double deep Q-learning-based caching approach that comprehensively accounts for file features such as lifetime, size, and importance. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based method. Furthermore, we extend our work to include a Transfer Learning (TL) approach to account for changes in file request rates in the SMDP framework. The proposed TL approach exhibits fast convergence, even in scenarios with increased differences in request rates between source and target domains, presenting a promising solution to the dynamic challenges of caching in real-world environments.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 17:17:46 UTC (1,278 KB)"

Under the proposed method, a software-defined radio (SDR) exposes the chest of a subject sitting nearby to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal with 64 sub-carriers at a center frequency 5.24 GHz, while another SDR in the close vicinity collects the modulated radio signal reflected off the chest. This way, we construct a custom dataset by collecting 160 minutes of labeled data (both raw radio data as well as the reference PPG signal) from 16 healthy young subjects. With this, we first utilize principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction of the radio data. Next, we denoise the radio signal and reference PPG signal using wavelet technique, followed by segmentation and Z-score normalization. We then synchronize the radio and PPG segments using cross-correlation method. Finally, we proceed to the waveform translation (regression) task, whereby we first convert the radio and PPG segments into frequency domain using discrete cosine transform (DCT), and then learn the non-linear regression between them. Eventually, we reconstruct the synthetic PPG signal by taking inverse DCT of the output of regression block, with a mean absolute error of 8.1294. The synthetic PPG waveform has a great clinical significance as it could be used for non-contact performance assessment of cardiovascular and respiratory systems of patients suffering from infectious diseases, e.g., covid19.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 14:04:13 UTC (3,743 KB)"

Using a human wizard to mimic certain operations of a potential system is particularly useful in situations where extensive engineering effort would otherwise be needed to explore the design possibilities offered by such operations. The WOZ method has been widely used in connection with speech and language technologies, but advances in sensor technology and pattern recognition as well as new application areas such as human-robot interaction have made it increasingly relevant to the design of a wider range of interactive systems. In such cases achieving acceptable performance at the user interface level often hinges on resource intensive improvements such as domain tuning, which are better done once the overall design is relatively stable. While WOZ is recognised as a valuable prototyping technique, surprisingly little effort has been put into exploring it from a methodological point of view. Starting from a survey of the literature, this paper presents a systematic investigation and analysis of the design space for WOZ for language technology applications, and proposes a generic architecture for tool support that supports the integration of components for speech recognition and synthesis as well as for machine translation. This architecture is instantiated in WebWOZ - a new web-based open-source WOZ prototyping platform. The viability of generic support is explored empirically through a series of evaluations. Researchers from a variety of backgrounds were able to create experiments, independent of their previous experience with WOZ. The approach was further validated through a number of real experiments, which also helped to identify a number of possibilities for additional support, and flagged potential issues relating to consistency in Wizard performance.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 13:59:47 UTC (3,746 KB)"

In response to the persistent challenges posed by emerging and reemerging pandemics, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based trade-offering between accuracy, computational burden, and representational feasibility. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. For three real-world cases, the best-performing algorithmic configuration archives 94\% accuracy presence, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust, as fluctuation in both spatial and temporal dynamics is not badly reflected by the framework's performance.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 13:30:52 UTC (4,612 KB)"

However, the integration of vector databases, which serve as a backbone for these augmentations, introduces critical challenges, particularly in ensuring accurate vector matching. False vector matching in these databases can significantly compromise the integrity and reliability of LLM outputs, leading to misinformation or erroneous responses. Despite the crucial impact of these issues, there is a notable research gap in methods to effectively detect and address false vector matches in LLM-augmented generation. This paper presents MeTMaP, a metamorphic testing framework developed to identify false vector matching in LLM-augmented generation systems. We derive eight metamorphic relations (MRs) from six NLP datasets, which form our method's core, based on the idea that semantically similar texts should match and dissimilar ones should not. MeTMaP uses these MRs to create sentence triplets for testing, simulating real-world LLM scenarios. Our evaluation of MeTMaP over 203 vector matching configurations, involving 29 embedding models and 7 distance metrics, uncovers significant inaccuracies. The results, showing a maximum accuracy of only 41.51\% on our tests compared to the original datasets, emphasize the widespread issue of false matches in vector matching methods and the critical need for effective detection and mitigation in LLM-augmented applications.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 12:13:35 UTC (1,373 KB)"

Present driving functions predominantly possess predefined parameters, and there is no universally accepted driving style for autonomous vehicles. Although driving may be technically safe, the passenger might still feel insecure due to a mismatch in driving styles between the human and the autonomous system. Incorporating driving style preferences into automated vehicles enhances acceptance, reduces uncertainty, and poses the opportunity to expedite their adoption. Despite the increased research focus on driving styles, there remains a need for comprehensive studies investigating how variations in the driving context impact the assessment of automated driving functions. Therefore, this work evaluates lateral driving style preferences for autonomous vehicles on rural roads, considering different weather and traffic situations. A controlled study (N = 32) was conducted with a variety of German participants utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator. The subjects experienced four different driving styles, including mimicking of their own driving behavior under two weather conditions. A notable preference for the more passive driving style became evident based on statistical analyses of participants' responses during and after the drives. A low curve-cutting gradient, moderate lateral and longitudinal acceleration constraints, and a pronounced reaction to oncoming traffic characterize this style. This study could not confirm the hypothesis that subjects prefer to be driven by mimicking their own driving behavior. Furthermore, the study illustrated that weather conditions and oncoming traffic substantially influence the perceived comfort during autonomous rides.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 10:22:27 UTC (8,621 KB)"
